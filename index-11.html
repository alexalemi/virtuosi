    <p>I hate politics, but for some reason I obsessively read about it. I
don't know why I do this, but I assume it's the same reason people slow
down for car wrecks and pay to see the geek [1]. Anyway, the big thing
in political news now is that if Congress can't pass a budget [2] by the
end of the day Friday, the government will shut down. Shutting down the
government means that 800,000 federal employees will go without pay [3],
lots of services will be put on hold and you won't be able to go to the
Smithsonian or the Grand Canyon. So it's kind of a big deal. Since the
ramifications of a government shutdown are so serious, there must be
some really important disagreements holding it up, right? Right? A quick
search (for example,
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/07/us-congress-staff-government-shutdown">here</a>),
shows that the big hold-up in passing the budget comes over a
disagreement on how much money should be cut from the budget.
Republicans want to cut $40 billion dollars and Democrats are willing to
cut $34.5 billion dollars. So the hold-up is over $5.5 billion. Let's
consider how utterly and stupidly insignificant this is. We shall take
as our inspiration Alemi's
<a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/12/law-and-large-numbers.html">post</a>
a while back offering several ways to help visualize the large and scary
sounding numbers thrown around in government budgets. The first thing
we'd like to do is find out what fraction this $5.5 billion discrepancy
is compared to the total budget. Alemi cites the total budget of the
U.S. government in the 2010 fiscal year to be $3.55 trillion. Hot dog!
So we see that: $$ \frac{\mbox{Disputed Difference}}{\mbox{Total
Budget}} = \frac{\$5.5 \times 10^9}{\$3.55 \times 10^{12}} =
0.0015 $$ So the disputed part amounts to 0.15% of the total budget or
one and half parts in a thousand. Let's compare this to some things for
which we have a better sense of scale. Let's pretend we are looking to
buy a car. We need it to get to work and, you know, get stuff done. If
our car costs $10,000 dollars then 0.15% of our total costs will be $$
\mbox{\$10,000} \times 0.0015 = \$15 $$ So the current budget
situation is like arguing for 6 months over a $15 charge on your $10,000
car. Sounds reasonable! Now let's switch gears and consider a timescale.
Let's consider a 40 hour work week. What's 0.15% of 40 hours? This comes
to $$ 40 \mbox{ hr} \times 0.0015 = 0.06 \mbox{ hr} $$ or, if you
prefer, $$ 0.06 \mbox{ hr} \times \frac{60 \mbox{ min}}{1 \mbox{
hr}} = 3.6 \mbox{ minutes} $$ So the current budget problem is like
arguing for six months over about three and a half extra minutes to your
work week. Now let's consider a length scale. Consider the US $1 bill.
According to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_one-dollar_bill#Small_size_notes">Wikipedia</a>,
the dollar bill is 6.14 inches long, 2.61 inches wide and 0.0043 inches
thick. That means that the ratio of the thickness to the width of a
dollar bill is $$ \frac{\mbox{Thickness}}{\mbox{Width}} =
\frac{0.0043 \mbox{ inches}}{2.61 \mbox{ inches}} = 0.0016 $$ or
slightly <em>more</em> than the disputed fraction of the budget. Hooray!
"That's all well and nice," you say, lowering your voice and leaning
over in a way that makes me uncomfortable, "but who is to <em>blame</em>?"
That's a great question! My answer will take the form of an experiment.
First, get a coin. Got it? Great. Now if you're Republican, let heads be
"The Republicans" and tails be "The Democrats." If you're a Democrat,
let heads be "The Democrats" and tails be "The Republicans." If you are
neither, then randomly assign a party to heads and allow the other to be
tails. Ready? The coin is to blame. [1] I use this in its original
meaning. That is, the guy whose job it was to do horribly gross things
at a carnival for money, not the guy whose main form of social
interaction is debating scenes in Star Wars on internet forums. A more
up-to-date comparison would have been to say "for the same reason that
people watch <em>Jersey Shore</em>." [2] That is, the budget for the 2011
fiscal year, which started on October 1st 2010. [3] Don't worry, all
members of Congress would be exempt from this and would still pick up
paychecks!</p>

    <p><em>Update [04/04/11]: It seems Clicky got too popular for our bandwidth
limits on the physics servers. Hopefully we'll be able to fix this
sometime soon...</em> <em><em> </em>Update [04/02/11]: We made the code faster, so
check out the new and improved Clicky!</em> Hey, kids! Would you like to be
a bit player in a grand experiment with poorly thought out objectives?
If so, then check
<a href="http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~aalemi/clicky/">this</a> out. It's a
little interactive "game" [1] that Alemi and Matt coded up. When you
click on the link, you will be redirected to a page showing something
like this:
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FYqCFtPrbT0/TZaZF4ubmPI/AAAAAAAAAMM/5Hf-_v0wTrY/s1600/clicky1.png"><img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FYqCFtPrbT0/TZaZF4ubmPI/AAAAAAAAAMM/5Hf-_v0wTrY/s400/clicky1.png"></a>
Using the arrow keys on your keyboard or by clicking on the arrow
buttons on the screen, you can move the dot around. Sound fun yet? Well,
the interesting bit comes in with the fact that anyone who wants to can
move the same dot at the same time. The plot will update automatically,
so if you're really bored you can sit around and watch someone else move
the dot around. Heck, you could even give the dot a cute name like Mr.
Dottington and tell it how your day was. We won't judge you. [2] Anyway,
check it out if you've got a bit of time to kill. Explore the space and
we'll get back to you with the "results" of this "experiment" sometime
in the "future." [1] There are no objectives and "winning" is undefined
(for a contrary argument, however, see Sheen et. al (2011)) [2] But Mr.
Dottington will.</p>

  Coming soon to a Kindle near you!</p>
<hr>
<p>We've been at this whole blogging thing for about a year now and I think
we've amassed a large and dedicated enough fanbase to finally release a
book! The track record so far for physicist-writers has been <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Spiral-Novel-Paul-McEuen/dp/038534211X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1301633241&amp;sr=8-1">quite
good</a>
of late, so we figured why not us? Well, lots of reasons actually. For
one thing, it's <em>really hard</em>. Books are, like, <em>hundreds</em> of pages
long. I barely stay coherent and on-topic in a one page blog post. For
another thing, it takes lots of time. I hardly have enough time to do my
laundry in time scales deemed "socially acceptable." How could I ever
find the time to write a book? Despite these potential setbacks, the
millions and millions of dollars that writers make still seems really
appealing. Who wouldn't want to be rich and popular forever. I mean,
just look at Oscar Wilde, Edgar Allan Poe and Herman Melville! Luckily,
a solution presented itself. I don't have time to write a book now, but
I found an old copy of my novel <em>Blue Dragon</em> laying around the house
that I was able to sell using the immense popularity of the Virtuosi
brand. The book will be published this summer by Clark Hall Publishing.
Here are a few advance reviews: <em>"Audacious, bodacious, entropic,
synoptic, electric, eclectic, entertaining, hyperbraining, high-roller,
tripolar... Buy</em><del>Against the Day</del> Blue Dragon." -- THE PHILADELPHIA
INQUIRER <em>"Corky isn't easy to 'get'. His melodies and chords I would
describe as complicated. But, behind all the disharmony and 11ths and so
forth.. it swings. This is my favorite Virtuosi book. It's an amazing
book and that's all you can say."</em> -- J.D. Jackson "<em>This is a book rich
in allegory and poignant social commentary. Also, you should call home
more"</em> -- Corky's Mom So these unbiased critics think it's totally rad.
Should you just take their word for it? Absolutely! But if you really
want see the book for yourself, here it is:

  Perhaps Step 2 was to steal copper?</p>
<hr>
<p>While flipping through a CRC Handbook whose days in the United States
are dwindling, I came across a section that described the naming
conventions of each chemical element. Most of the names made sense to
me. For example, Nobelium is named after Alfred Nobel (surprise!).
However, the Nickel entry was the following: Nickel: Named after
<em>Satan</em>or <em>Old Nick</em> <em><em> This confused me greatly. What the heck is Santa
Claus doing hanging out with Satan [1]? After a bit of poking around on
the internet, I found an article from 1931 by a guy named William
Baldwin called </em>The Story of Nickel, How "Old Nick's" Gnomes were
Outwitted</em>. Needless to say, this did not allay my confusion. Here is
the relevant passage from the article: <em>In the early part of the
eighteenth century fresh lodes of ore were laid open in Saxony where
from times immemorial silver and copper mines had been worked. This new
ore was so glittering and full of promise as to cause the greatest
excitement, but after innumerable trials and endless labor all</em> <em>that
could he obtained from the ore was a worthless metal. In disgust the
superstitious miners named the ore kupfer-nickel after "Old Nick" and
his mischievous gnomes who were charged with plaguing the miners and
bewitching the ore.</em> This "worthless" metal is nickel. Kupfernickel is
the German name for the nickel ore (see image below) which comes from

  Ore that, if not for gnomes, would contain that sweet sweet copper</p>

<p>And that's the story of Nickel! Tune in next time [2] for our ongoing
118-part series, <em>Better Know an Element!</em> [1] Turns out "Old Nick" is
an English name for the Devil. Go figure. But those of you named
Nicholas should not be upset, as your name comes from the Greek
Nikholaos, which literally means "victory-people." So you've got that
going for you. [2] I have no plans of ever doing this again.</p>

<p>I was reading a discussion on green energy recently, in particular wind
power, where the following claim was made</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>enough wind turbines to power the world would cover the surface of
the world.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, this was quickly decried by supporters of wind power, but the claim
has stuck with me. The question on my mind today is: How much of the
earth's surface would have to be covered to power the earth with wind
turbines? We can't hope to put an exact number on this, the best we'll
be able to do is an order of magnitude. I also don't know much about
wind turbines, so I'll be making liberal use of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine">wikipedia</a> as I go. Let's
start with the size of the wind turbine. According to wikipedia the
largest wind turbine has a rotor sweep diameter of 128 m. To an order of
magnitude, we'll say that our average wind turbine has a diameter of 100
m. Next we need to know how much power this puts out. The maximum power
of this turbine is \~8 MW. However, it certainly wouldn't be producing
that at all times. Current wind farms produce around 20-30% maximum
capacity. However, these turbines are careful placed in areas of high
wind. We're not going to get that lucky with our wind dose when we place
our turbines haphazardly, so we'll assume they produce at 1% maximum
capacity. According to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_energy_resources_and_consumption">wikipedia</a>,
the world energy consumption in 2008 was 474 EJ (exajoules), or an
average power use in 2008 of 15 TW. To an order of magnitude then, the
area we'd have to occupy with wind turbines to power the world would be:
$$\left( \frac{(100\text{ m})^2}{1\text{
turbine}}\right)\left(\frac{1\text{ turbine}}{.01<em>8 \text{
MW}}\right)15 \text{TW} = 2\cdot 10^{12}\text{ m}^2$$ That's
2</em>10^6 km^2, or, in english, 2 million square kilometers. For
comparison, the land area of the united states is roughly 10 millon
square kilometers. So we'd only have to cover 1/5th of the united states
with wind turbines to power the entire world (in 2008, no doubt power
use has risen since then)! While that is a lot of space taken up, it is
nowhere near the entire surface of the world. There are, of course,
<a href="http://xkcd.com/556/">other concerns</a> about wind power. <em>Note: maybe
the wind turbines are less efficient overall. Also, I assumed that the
footprint was just the square area of the turbine diameter. I know this
is the size of the face of the turbine, but to an order of magnitude I
imagine it is correct for the space occupied on the ground.</em></p>

  In an emergency, Richard Dean Anderson's mullet can be used as a flotation device and/or standard kilogram.</p>
<hr>
<p>Welcome to the First Physics Challenge Problem Award Show! We received
an integer number of solutions to our challenge problem and at long last
and after much deliberation, we have chosen our winner. We had before
indicated vaguely that there may be some sort of prizes involved in this
competition. After consultation with our financial advisors and breaking
Alemi's piggy bank, we have decided on the following prizes: First
Place: A brand new CRC Handbook! Second Place: An autographed [1]
picture of Scott Bakula! Honorable Mention: Nothing! [2] So before we
officially announce our winner, let's backtrack and build up some
suspense. The challenge was to come up with a bunch of MacGyveresque
experiments to determine as closely as possible the standard second,
meter and kilogram using only the materials handy to you on a desert [3]
island. Just about every response we got successfully answered the
question, so we had to base our final result on robustness and
uncertainties. We also tended to favor those that did not rest on
precise knowledge of one's own height, weight, etc (though there is
nothing wrong with these approaches). So without further ado, the winner
is.... [pause] [unnecessarily long secondary pause] George from
Australia! George provided a list of no fewer than 11 different methods
for determining the second, meter and kilogram. The second was found by
timing (by means of a pendulum) the time it takes for the sun to move
through an a given angle measure. This measurement can be made each day
for a year to get the best results (remember, you've got all the time in
the world!). Now we have the time it takes the sun to go through a given
angle measured in "swings of a pendulum." We can calculate the transit
time of the sun into seconds and then we can find the number of seconds
per swing of the pendulum. So now we have a second. But since the period
of a pendulum is given by: $$ T = 2\pi \sqrt{l/g}, $$ we also have the
length of the pendulum in meters. From this we can make a standard
meter. Now all that is left is to find the kilogram. This can be done by
making a water-tight enclosure of volume 1000 cm^3 and filling it with
water, giving a kilogram that can be compared to other objects to get a
longer lasting standard kilogram. Any other knowledge you may have (i.e.
known height and weight) may be used to check the above measurements. A
very close second place goes to Alireza, who provided a very strong
submission and perhaps one of the best uses of snail mucus in the entire
competition! Alireza's solution was to use one's own known height to
construct the standard meter. From this you can make a pendulum to get
the second and a box o' water (sealed with tar, glue and snail mucus) to
get the kilogram. Both George and Alireza provided very detailed
responses with special attention paid toward reducing uncertainty and
checking their answers through several independent measurements. They
also both carried out parts of their experiments. Congratulations to you
both! In addition to the winning responses, we also received several
other submissions that merit honorable mention. They are.... Oliver, who
provided several acoustical experiments using his SUPERPOWER of perfect
pitch. Nicole, who noted that we were not correct in giving the Titanic
the designation
"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty%27s_Ship">HMS</a>" as this is
reserved for ships in the British Royal Navy. In fact, the Titanic was
designated "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Mail_Ship">RMS</a>" since
it carried mail. Thanks, Nicole! Gary, who completely ignored the
premise, used arbitrary units and left a very amusing note on his
deathbed giving all his arbitrary units to be found and converted by the
first enterprising explorer who lands on his island. I know you had
asked for your prize in cash and while I cannot directly accomodate that
wish, do know that Richard Dean Anderson smiles can be cashed in most
banks nationwide (see [2]). So thanks to everyone who submitted a
response to this Challenge. We enjoyed reading all of the solutions and
we hope you had fun thinking about it. And next time you go on a boat,
don't forget that CRC! [1] Autograph will be signed by me on an 8.5" x
11" picture of Scott Bakula printed by a laser printer on regular copy
paper. [2] Well, you receive nothing of monetary value but, know deep
down in your hearts that in the picture at the top of this post, Richard
Dean Anderson is smiling at you. So you've got that going for you, which
is nice. [3] Sadly, we did not choose a dessert island. That would have
been much more fun.</p>

    <p>Though I know that two posts in one day is recently unprecedented, I've
been meaning to post about the Japan nuclear crisis for a few days. The
various major news outlets are doing a good job, or so it seems, of
keeping us informed of the events going on over there. However, I found
myself rather puzzled over the physics of what was happening. From the
news articles I was unable to figure out what was actually causing the
meltdown, beyond some problem with the cooling. As a postdoc in my lab
asked, "Isn't all they have to do drop the control rods and the reaction
ends?" So I decided to do a little digging. I've found a couple of
places that do a nice job of explain some of the physics of what is
actually happening, <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2011/03/fukushima_crisis_anatomy_of_a.html">nature
news</a>
(not sure if the nature blogs are behind a paywall), and <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=fukushima-core">scientific
american</a>
(not up on current events, but a nice summary of what can/might go
wrong). I'm sure there are many other places doing a good job of
explaining things, but these are the ones and I found, and hopefully
they help clarify what is actually happening.</p>

<p>Hello, again! Remember us? I don't. Anyway, apologies for the lack of
activity here. There are plenty of people* to blame for this lack of
activity, but I don't want to name names. The real purpose of this
pseudo-update is to SUPER DUPER promise that the winners of our first
Monthly Physics Challenge problem will be announced tomorrow. Thanks for
your patience!
In the meantime, there's a totally rad video-ification of photos of
Saturn (and moons) taken by the Cassini spacecraft that was Astronomy
Picture of the Day yesterday and will (presumably) be part of an IMAX
<a href="http://www.outsideinthemovie.com/">movie</a> in the future. You can check

Between building airplanes and playfully destroying everyone else in my
apartment at Super Smash Brothers, my roommate Nathan brought up an
interesting recent fact about LeBron James. He told me that LeBron
scored 11 consecutive field goals (not in football... you know who you
are) in one game. Apparently this was a pretty special event, but how
rare is it for a player of LeBron's caliber? TO THE SCIENCE-MOBILE! The
Problem! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHltCzuwlOs&amp;feature=related">ESPN 8, The
Ocho</a> tells
me that LeBron's career field goal percentage is 47.5%. Considering the
number of shots he takes, this is a pretty good number. To compare, the
highest field goal percentage for a single season was Wilt Chamberlin
with 72.7%, but eye witness testimony says he was around 10 feet tall
and would wait in the offensive paint all game. Let's see how improbable
this 11 in a row streak is. The generic question we are going to need to
answer is as follows: If a basketball player takes N shots in one game,
with a shooting probability of q, what is the probability that the
player will make AT LEAST k shots in a row? We'll call this probability
P(N) This turns out to be a tricky problem, but let's take a shot (awful
pun... I sincerely apologize). We can take care of simple cases: If N &lt;
k, then P(N) = 0. This tells us you can't have a streak of k if you
don't take k shots! If N = k, P(N) = q^k. This is the probability of
getting k in a row if you take k shots, not too surprising yet. When N
&gt; k, things get more interesting. Finding the Recurrence Relation Our
goal is to write a relationship that has this form: P(N) = P(N-1) +
blank What's blank? "You don't worry about blank... let me worry about
blank!" We'll need to look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion_exclusion_principle">inclusion-exclusion
principle</a>.
This principle basically says that when we want to take all DISTINCT
items in two sets, we need to take all of the elements in one set, and
add all elements in the second set which are DISTINCT from the first.
For example, if A = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, then the
union of A and B is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. Note that I did not
include 3 and 4 twice. Let's take a look at the expertly designed (5
minutes before class) google docs drawing below:
<a href="https://docs.google.com/drawings/pub?id=1Ef34hZJ9mtF-GDUSpmJA4Ke2mS3BAHLsDwAk1GX19Dc&amp;w=1122&amp;h=485"><img alt="image" src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/pub?id=1Ef34hZJ9mtF-GDUSpmJA4Ke2mS3BAHLsDwAk1GX19Dc&amp;w=1122&amp;h=485"></a>
The entire line represents N shots being taken. Each shot gets its own
little column (not all columns shown). Using the inclusion-exclusion
principle with the following sets will give us the answer. Choose A to
be the first N-1 shots, and B to be all N shots. The principle tells us
first to take everything from A, which is the probability P(N-1) shown
in red. B will be the entire line, but the principle tells us to only
add DISTINCT chances from B. Since the only difference in B is one more
shot than A, the only distinct chance for a streak of k shots will be in
the last k shots, shown in yellow as P(k). This is only distinct if the
(k+1)th to last shot shown in green is missed! Otherwise a streak of k
would have been included in A already. There is one more place for a
streak to be already included in A. If there was a streak in the blue
section, we must not include the B streak so we don't double count.
Phew... Let's put this all together by multiplying the probabilities of
each of those events: P(N) = P(N-1) + (probability of yellow
streak)<em>(probability we miss green)</em>(probability of no streak in blue)
$$P(N) = P(N-1) + q^k \times (1-q) \times (1 - P(N-k-1))$$ This gives
us a recurrence relation for the probabilities! This is a general
statement about the probability of at least one streak of length k out
of N chances, given each has a probability q. Since I'm just going to
plug this into Python anyway to handle the data, this equation is good
enough. The expectation value of an event is the probability multiplied
by the number of chances. For example, the expectation value of getting
heads with 2 tosses is just (1/2)*2 = 1. The plan is to compile a list
of his field goal attempts in every game LeBron has played in the NBA,
and sum the expectation values for each N. $$ \mbox{Expectation} =
\sum_i P(i) \times \mbox{(number of games with i shots)} $$ Using
LeBron's actual field goal attempt data for each game (up to February 4,
2011), we find that LeBron is expected number of games with at least a
streak of 11 in a row is 1.128. This is a higher expectation value than
the number of heads in 2 coin flips! So this is MORE expected than the
number of heads we would see with 2 coin flips. This isn't very exciting
given the number of shots he has taken and his shooting percentage. Data

<p>The streak in question is highlighted in red, so it appears we expect it
to happen 0.169% of his games. The Realization Of course I did all of
this before looking up the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/truehoop/miamiheat/notebook/_/page/heatreaction-110203/miami-heat-orlando-magic">actual
article</a>.
I'll quote the blurb here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>LeBron James set a personal record by making his first 11 field goals
to start the game. His previous career-high was 10 straight field
goals after tip-off, recorded against Chicago in 2008. After hitting
his first 11 field goal attempts on Thursday night, James shot
6-for-14 thereafter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well... this calculation just got a bit easier. He has played 667 games,
and the probability of getting 11 straight off the bat is q^k =
0.475^11 = 0.0002777. Multiply this by 667 games to get the expected
value of 0.185. Sure this is 6 times smaller than our previous
calculation; however it's still not statistically that impressive. How
would LeBron's expected number change if he shot the same percentage
(72.7%) as Wilt for his record breaking season? The expected number of
games with 11 in a row during the game would be 72.38 games!! So this is
incredibly dependent on the shooting percentage. We have a factor of
q^k everywhere! Certainly it's dependent on the number of shots taken
in a game too. The probability P(N) is a monotonically increasing
function! Moral Given LeBron's shooting percentage and high number of
shots per game, we expect that he would have at least 1 of these streak
of 11 games so far in his career. This is certainly not to diminish this
feat though. You still need to take 20 some shots a game in the NBA with
nearly 50% shooting accuracy! We also have a nice formula to apply to
more sports streaks! More to come...</p>

So, some of us over here at Virtuosi Central have organized a challenge
problem for the physics community here at Cornell. Well, we thought we
would open up the challenge to the great wide world. The more
submissions the merrier. The deadline is March 1, and submissions can be
sent to our email. Details can be found at
<a href="http://bit.ly/physicschallenge">bit.ly/physicschallenge</a>. Good luck and
happy hunting.</p>
