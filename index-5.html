<p>Summer is upon us. That means summer research, and online games. In
order to help you through this three day weekend and beyond, I thought
I'd share some of the more physics inspired games I've been playing
lately to pass the time. I really enjoy physics based games. When done
right, I think they can not only be fun and engaging but have the
opportunity to teach you something.</p>
<h4>Colonel Blotto</h4>
<p>First up is a web Colonel Blotto tournament that I coded up, which you
can find
<a href="http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~aalemi/blotto/index.php">here</a>.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel_Blotto">Colonel Blotto</a> is a silly
little game theoretic game where you try and assign one hundred soldiers
between 10 different fields. Opponents do the same. Neither side knows
what the other side is going to do. The game turns out to have some very
interesting dynamics. Apparently for more than 12 soldiers, the game
does not have a deterministic optimal strategy, so you're guess is as
best as mine for how to beat the other players in the pool. Its worth
checking out. Feel free to try your hand at the pool. Once the
participation has settled down, I want to try and analyze the strategies
that people employ and see if I can do any interesting statistical
physics with it. I spent a good chunk of this weekend working out the
bugs, so it should run smoothly now, but be sure to let me know if you
discover any errors.</p>
<h4>Manufactoria</h4>
<p>This game has been sucking up a lot of my evenings lately.
<a href="http://pleasingfungus.com/">Manufactoria</a> is one of the most pleasing
puzzle games I've played in a long time. It pretends to be about
selecting robots that meat specification, but really its about
programming finite state machines. I've really enjoyed this game a lot.
It has a real engineering type bent, but unlike a lot of games that
require critical thinking to solve a puzzle, once you know how to solve
it, it isn't tedious to do so. A great game, and I highly recommend it.
One of the best games I've played in a while, although maybe I'm so into
it because I'm reading through <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=-olQAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=feynman+lectures+on+computation&amp;dq=feynman+lectures+on+computation&amp;ei=qOoDTIntCqCszQSc-cyODA&amp;cd=1">The Feynman Lectures on
Computation</a>
right now. He gives as exercises very similar problems to the ones in
the game. Its also in regards to these types of problems specifically
that he gives <a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/04/some-of-best-advice-youll-ever-receive.html">this
quote</a>.
A few tips. (1) You can use asdf or the arrow keys to rotate the pieces.
(2) Space bar switches the chirality of the gates (swaps red for blue).
(3) In order to round corners, you just make the conveyors meet at a T
(4) You don't have to enter the gates on the open side. (5) During
tests, move the slider in the bottom left to the right to speed up time.
If you manage to solve all of the puzzles, three bonus ones will appear
at the bottom.</p>
<h4>Fantastic Contraption</h4>
<p>This one is old. Its been on the internet for a while now, but if you
haven't seen <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/inXile_Ent/fantastic-contraption?acomplete=fantastic">Fantastic
Contraption</a>
you should check it out. Its a very free form game. You need to get the
pink block into the goal, but in order to do so, you can build any
contraption you desire out of wheels and sticks. Its a great time. Most
impressive of course is the level that some kids have taken it to. Once
you've played with the game a bit, be sure to search <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=fantastic+contraption&amp;page=&amp;utm_source=opensearch">youtube for
fantastic
contraption</a>,
and marvel at the engineering insight some of these kids show. I like
this game a lot, but it can get a bit tedious to get your design to work
out just right.</p>
<h4>Splitter 2</h4>
<p>This one is neat. As a kid I read the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Dark_Materials">His Dark
Materials</a> trilogy
(which started with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Compass">The Golden
Compass</a>). Anyway the
second book in the series is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Subtle_Knife">The Subtle
Knife</a> which stars a
knife, the subtle knife in fact, which can cut through anything like
butter, and I mean anything, including the fabric between worlds. This
led to many day dreams as a kid, and I've spent a lot of time thinking
about what a knife like that could actually do. Anyway, <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/CasualCollective/splitter-2">Splitter
2</a> is a
puzzle game that works along those lines. You have to get a ball do the
goal, but do so by cutting through pieces of wood on the stage. A neat
game. Worth a look.</p>
<h4>Phun</h4>
<p>While I'm hear, I can't help but mention
<a href="http://www.phunland.com/wiki/Home">Phun</a>. While not strictly a game.
Phun is a physics sandbox similar in style to Fantastic Contraption, but
with a whole lot more features. This one is loads of fun to play with,
and I think could really serve as a learning tool for some classes.
Worth the download. If you know of any other physics type games, drop
them in the comments. I'm always on the look out for good ones.</p>

I'd like to start a short series of posts on what I'm doing this summer.
Like most all of the first year physics graduate students, I've found a
<a href="http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~rthorne/">research group</a> at Cornell
for the summer, and if everything goes well, I'll continue working with
them after the summer is done. This is good for three reasons. First,
I'm getting paid, so I can do things like pay rent. I'm not all about
the money, but having a place to live is a big deal to me. Second, I'm
getting a chance to explore a new area of research, with limited
expectation of commitment on my part. Third, if everything works out,
I've found the group I'll be working with the for the next 4-6 years.
I'd like to spend a few posts here on The Virtuosi discussing first the
physics I'm considering, and then what I actually do. Today I'm going to
talk about the most exciting sounding piece of my work,
cryopreservation. <strong>What do we mean when we talk about
cryopreservation?</strong> For many of us our first thought may be Han Solo
frozen in carbonite. This is the basic idea. Cryopreservation is the
freezing biological samples, and thawing them, while they retain
biological viability. At least, that's the idea. At the moment,
cryopreservation is the freezing and thawing biological samples, and
hoping that some of them remain biologically viable. Even though the
methods have been in development since the 1950s, successes are limited
even for such simple objects as spermatozoa or oocytes (sperm &amp; eggs),
let alone larger and much more complicated objects like Harrison Ford.
<strong>Why would we want to cryopreserve something? (and did I just invent a
verb?)</strong> The idea is fairly simple. If we cool down biological samples,
biological functions slow down or completely stop. The hope is that if
we get samples sufficiently cold, we can suspend biological (and all
other) functions indefinitely. This would allow indefinitely
preservation of many things. Eggs and sperm for reproductive purposes
(both human and other animals), plant seeds, blood (for transfusions),
vaccines, drugs (no more pesky shelf life for pharmaceuticals until you
unfreeze them). The perfect frozen strawberries. The list of
possibilities is huge. And according to my dictionary, cryopreserve is a
well established verb. <strong>Why is it so hard?</strong> It's easy to stick
something in the freezer. That seems to work on my food. However, it
doesn't work well on biological samples. If we just stick them in the
freezer many of the cells are damaged irreparably. We'd like to know
why. To answer this we're going to need to take a step down to the
cellular level. I'm not a biologist, so I'm not going to attempt to
explain cell structure to you. For our current purposes it is sufficient
to know that cells have an inside and an outside (then, doesn't most
everything?), separated by a semi-permeable membrane, and that both
inside and outside of the cells there is water. We need to take a brief
detour now into the realm of water. Water is a fantastically amazing
substance, and I'm not just saying that because we (and most/all life on
earth) would all die without it. Water is fascinating from a pure
physics perspective. Now, when I refer to water, I'm going to use it to
mean H2O, in any phase. Colloquially we usually mean liquid water when
we say water, we say ice we mean crystalline frozen water, and steam
when we mean vaporous water. I'm going to call all of these things
'water' and I will specify what phase I mean by saying 'frozen, liquid,
vapor'. I will refer to frozen <em>crystalline</em> water as <em>ice</em>. So what's
so fascinating about water? Well, first off, it is one of the only
substances that expands when it crystallizes (forms ice). Most objects
become more dense when they transform from a liquid to a solid. Water
doesn't. This is why ice floats. There are many other fascinating
aspects of water, for example, that liquid water is most dense at 4 C.
This is mostly responsible for why fish survive in the winter. Ice forms
on top of lakes/rivers, and the 4C water stays at the bottom of the lake
because it is the densest. But for our purposes, what we really need to
know is that water expands on forming ice. When we freeze our cells,
this expansion of water can cause massive problems. Everything in the
cell besides the water contracts on cooling. The water crystallizes and
expands (by about 9%). If you've ever frozen something liquid in a very
full container and seeing it split the container open, the idea is very
similar. The intracellular water can crystallize and split open the cell
membrane. Once you've split the cell membrane, there's no way (that I've
seen) to successfully revive that cell. It turns out that ice formation
outside the cell isn't such a big deal, it usually just pushes the cells
around. The water in the cells is what is most likely to cause damage to
our biological tissues when we freeze them. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WD5-4KXF5HB-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=08%2F31%2F1968&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=41501096aa949fd2c441dc760bc6513a">Early
studies</a>
showed survival rates between 10^-6% and \~50%. Those are not good
odds. <strong>How do we prevent this damage?</strong> There are two methods currently
in practice to prevent damage on cooling. The first of these is slow
cooling. It was discovered that if you cool your sample at a rate of \~1
C/min very little to no intracellular ice forms, though intercellular
ice still forms. The water in and between cells is not pure water, but
contains all kinds of things (proteins, salts, etc). This means that it
starts to crystallize not at 0 C, but somewhere lower. This is the
reason we salt sidewalks in the winter (at least, in places where we get
snow). The salt lowers the freezing point of water, causing the ice/snow
to melt even if the temperature is below 0 C. Of course, if the
temperature gets low enough it will still freeze. So our intra and
intercellular water crystallizes below 0 C. It turns out that the
intercellular water starts to crystallize before the intracellular
water. This means we have ice formation outside the cell while the water
inside the cell is still liquid. Earlier I told you that we needed to
know that the membrane of a cell was semi-permiable. This is why. Some
water diffuses through the membrane. At room temperature, the liquid
water outside the cells diffuses into the cell at the same rate that the
liquid water inside the cell diffuses out of the cell. Now, if we start
crystallizing the intercellular water, there will be less liquid water
moving into the cell. But since the intracellular water is still liquid
it will still be diffusing out at the same rate. This results in a
partial dehydration of the cell, more liquid water moving out than in.
This is a basic example of osmotic pressure. With less liquid water in
the cell, when it does crystallize, the ice crystals that form are
smaller, and less likely to damage the cell membrane. This method is not
perfect, because extreme dehydration of cells will also damage them, due
to cell shrinkage and extremely high solute concentration (this
phenomena is called osmotic shock). The second method that is considered
is ultrafast cooling. Here we must take another diversion into physics
land. You may have noticed my emphasis on ice as crystalline water. It
turns out that when you freeze water, forming a crystal is not the only
option available to it (and we're not even going to discuss the variety
of crystals it can form). It can also form a glass. Now, if you're not a
physicist, you're probably not familiar with glass as a type of
substance, but rather as the thing you put in your windows and drink out
of. A glass, to a physicist, is, essentially, a solid without long range
order. The best way to think about of it would be to imagine you took
liquid water and stopped time for the water (<em>not</em> freezing it in the
conventional sense). That's a glass. It looks like liquid water, has the
same density as liquid water, but is a solid. It's a very strange
concept, and I'm going to save a more thorough discussion for a later
post, because that takes me into a whole different research area I'm
working on this summer. For our purposes, it is sufficient to know that
we can reach a solid state of water at cold temperatures that has the
same density as liquid water. Based on our discussion above, the
advantages should be immediately obvious. Without the expansion of ice
to worry about, the solidification of water is nowhere near as damaging
to our cells. By vitrifying (turning to a glass) our liquid water, we
should see much less damage to the cells. To achieve vitrification, you
have to cool down the cells much faster (depending on the substance
&gt;1000 C/min). How do we do this? The conventional method is to dunk the
cells directly into liquid nitrogen, or put them into a very cold stream
of gas (around liquid nitrogen temperatures). I should note that I'm
skipping over a very large field of putting cryopreservants into cells
and freezing them. However, the effect of cryopreservants is to prevent
ice crystallization, and so this is just a method of vitrification. It
just makes it easier to achieve by lowering the rate you have to cool
the sample at. <strong>So that's it?</strong> It may seem like that's the solution.
Cooling fast enough to vitrify the liquid water, and we'll get good
cryopreservation of our cells. The rest is just technology development.
Unfortunately, it's not that easy. It turns out that warming is a harder
problem to solve than cooling. When we warm up glassy water, it turns
back into supercooled liquid water (liquid water way below the freezing
point of water). I'll discuss this in more detail in my next post on my
research. So now we've got really cold water, and it will start forming
ice, unless we warm up fast enough to prevent that, very similar to how
we had to cool down very quickly to prevent ice formation. The problem
is, experiments suggest that 'fast enough' is at least 10-100 times
faster than cooling down. Not only that, but on cooling down, we're
really trying to get very very cold. On warming up, we don't want to get
much over room temperature, otherwise we'll fry the cells. So we have to
warm really really quickly, in an extremely well controlled manner. So
far, this has proved very challenging to do. A recent study with mouse
oocytes achieved a \~90% success rate with their freezing/thawing
cycles, and that is the best that I've seen. 90% is pretty good, but
we'd like to do better. <strong>So what's your research this summer?</strong> It
turns out that my research isn't so much into cryopreservation. As I
will talk about next post, it is more into the physics of
crystallization and glass formation of aqueous substances, where there
is a lot of fundamental physics still to be understood. However, one of
the most exciting eventual applications is cryopreservation. We've
already developed a fast cooling system, and we're working on a fast
warming system that will allow us to study crystallization and glass
formation, and hopefully extend the techniques we develop into the field
of cryopreservation. <strong>That's way cool!</strong> Yes. Yes it is. Even if that
is a horrible pun. <em>Note: The question and answer format was inspired by
Chad over at <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/principles/">Uncertain Principles</a>
and his research blogging.</em></p>

<p>Probability is a tricky thing. There are a lot of nonsensical answers to

article</a>
about the recent <a href="http://www.g4g4.com/">Gathering for Gardner</a> meeting

mathematicians, magicians and puzzle makers where they get together and
talk about interesting things. The meetings were inspired by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Gardner">Martin

awesomest dudes of our time, who unfortunately just passed away. The

<p>"I have two children. One is a boy born on a Tuesday. What is the
probability I have two boys?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Think about that for a moment. Not too hard though. The answer turns out
to be surprising. Upon reading the question, I thought about it for a
long time and managed to confused myself entirely. Thinking I had gone
crazy, I wrote a little python script to test the riddle, which only
left me more convinced I had gone insane. I've spent most of the night
thinking about it, and after making it half way to crazy, I've come
around and am momentarily convinced the puzzle makes perfect sense. I'm
going to attempt to convince you it makes perfect sense, but I plan on
doing it in steps so as to reduce the bewilderment.</p>
<h4>Playing Cards</h4>
<p>Forget the question. Lets play a game of cards. You shuffle a deck and
deal me two cards:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zCNBPs3KI/AAAAAAAAAK4/WdtzaW_A6pk/s1600/b2fv.png"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zCNBPs3KI/AAAAAAAAAK4/WdtzaW_A6pk/s320/b2fv.png"></a><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zCNBPs3KI/AAAAAAAAAK4/WdtzaW_A6pk/s1600/b2fv.png"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zCNBPs3KI/AAAAAAAAAK4/WdtzaW_A6pk/s320/b2fv.png"></a></p>
<p>I accidentally flip one of them over.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zCuZ4KiQI/AAAAAAAAALA/cNa3n-rjuTg/s1600/23.png"><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zCuZ4KiQI/AAAAAAAAALA/cNa3n-rjuTg/s320/23.png"></a><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zCNBPs3KI/AAAAAAAAAK4/WdtzaW_A6pk/s1600/b2fv.png"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zCNBPs3KI/AAAAAAAAAK4/WdtzaW_A6pk/s320/b2fv.png"></a></p>
<p>Whats the probability that my other card is red? Well, that ones easy,
its about half. Sure, its not exactly a half, knowing that the deck is
finite and that the draws are done without replacement, knowing that the
card showing is a red one means that there are only 52/2 - 1= 26 -1 = 25
red cards out of a deck of 52-1 = 51 cards giving a probability of 49%.
But its basically a half. Lets do over, deal me two cards:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zCNBPs3KI/AAAAAAAAAK4/WdtzaW_A6pk/s1600/b2fv.png"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zCNBPs3KI/AAAAAAAAAK4/WdtzaW_A6pk/s320/b2fv.png"></a><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zCNBPs3KI/AAAAAAAAAK4/WdtzaW_A6pk/s1600/b2fv.png"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zCNBPs3KI/AAAAAAAAAK4/WdtzaW_A6pk/s320/b2fv.png"></a></p>
<p>Darn, I flipped one of them over again:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zCNBPs3KI/AAAAAAAAAK4/WdtzaW_A6pk/s1600/b2fv.png"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zCNBPs3KI/AAAAAAAAAK4/WdtzaW_A6pk/s320/b2fv.png"></a><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zDlNQLJyI/AAAAAAAAALI/WPBCX9i-Pk0/s1600/5.png"><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zDlNQLJyI/AAAAAAAAALI/WPBCX9i-Pk0/s320/5.png"></a></p>
<p>Whats the probability that my other card is red? About a half still.<em>
(</em>Sure, this time its really 26/51 = 51%). Nothing mysterious going on.
Do over again. Deal me two cards:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zCNBPs3KI/AAAAAAAAAK4/WdtzaW_A6pk/s1600/b2fv.png"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zCNBPs3KI/AAAAAAAAAK4/WdtzaW_A6pk/s320/b2fv.png"></a><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zCNBPs3KI/AAAAAAAAAK4/WdtzaW_A6pk/s1600/b2fv.png"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zCNBPs3KI/AAAAAAAAAK4/WdtzaW_A6pk/s320/b2fv.png"></a></p>
<p>This time I'll ask a little trickier question. Whats the probability
that both my cards are red? Ah, well its about 1/2 * 1/2 or about 1/4 =
25%. (The real answer is 24.5%) Alright smarty pants. Whats the
probability that I had a red card and a black one? Well, that ought to
be about 1/2 (Real answer 51%). All in all, I could have a red card,
then a black one (RB), or a black one, then a red one (BR), or a red one
then a red one (RR) or a black one then a black one (BB). 4 distinct
possibilities, each of which are equally likely, so the above two
answers make complete sense. There is only one way in four to get both
red cards, but two ways out of four to have both a red and a black. So
far so good. Lets ask a different question. Now I'm going to get a bit
obtuse. You deal me two cards. Now you ask me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey Alemi, do you have a red card?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meaning, do I have at least one red card. I respond, "Yes." Now, go with
your gut. You know I have at least one red card. What do you reckon the
color of the other one is? Probably black you say? You'd be correct.
Looking at our breakdown above, I could have gotten RR, RB, BR, or BB as
my cards dealt. Each was equally likely, but now you know something
else. You know that I have at least one red card, so we only have three
possibilities left, I either have RR, RB, or BR. Each of which was
equally likely. So whats the probability that my other card is black?
About 2/3 or 67%. (Real answer: 67.5%) Alright, same situation. You deal
me two cards, I reveal that I have at least one red one. Whats the
probability that my other card is red? Well, obviously 1/3 or 33%
(Actually 32.5%) since this is the opposite question to the one directly
above, and follows from the same reasoning. Fine. No problems. All of
this makes sense.</p>
<h4>Offspring</h4>
<p>Instead of playing cards, lets return to offspring. Lets first look at a
classic probability riddle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have exactly two children. At least one of them is a boy. What is
the probability that the other one is a boy?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If I were to give you this question straightaway, most people would have
said the probability would be a 1/2. Their reasoning being that boys and
girls are equally likely. But having just led you through the playing
cards, hopefully now it makes some sense how the true answer to this
question is 1/3 or 33%. Originally my family could have been BB,BG,GB,or
GG. Each of which was equally likely. Telling you I have at least one
boy means now we are dealing with only the situations BB, BG or GB,
still all equally likely, making the probability 1/3. Fine. Now, lets
reexamine the true question at hand:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I have two children. One is a boy born on a Tuesday. What is the
probability I have two boys?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is it a half? Is it 1/3? What do you reckon? At first thought, it seems
like the Tuesday bit shouldn't enter into it at all, but on second
thought, I've just revealed a lot more information than I did in the
previous question. I've told you something specific about one of my
children. This is analogous to when I accidently flipped over one of my
cards, revealing not only its color but its count as well. Hopefully it
makes sense that the probability ought to be much closer to a half than
to a third. In fact the answer is 13/27 = 48.1%. With a little thought,
you should be able to come up with that number yourself. Otherwise, see
<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18950-magic-numbers-a-meeting-of-mathemagical-tricksters.html?full=true">the
article</a>
I mentioned at the beginning of this post. They have a nice breakdown at
the bottom. Hopefully, at this point if you've read this far, you'd
should be wondering why this question was so mysterious to begin with,
and if thats the case, I did my job. If you think the question is
obvious, and think it would have been obvious even without the card
analogy, try and ask the boy-born-on-a-tuesday question by itself to one
of your friends. I guarantee they'll be bewildered. Its a fun problem,
and one that illustrates just how strange and counterintuitive
probability can be. If you want some other mind twisting mathematical

            </header><div class="e-content entry-content">
                    <p>I was outside talking with Alemi last week and we were both startled to
realize that the frozen white tundras of Ithaca had somehow transformed
into fields of green. Apparently the snow was a temporary fixture that
covered real live grass. Neato, gang! The joy at seeing green grass led
quickly to surprise, confusion and then anger. Why the heck is grass
green? Well, things look a color when they reflect back that color. So
grass is green because its pigments (chlorophyll) absorb only a certain
range of the visible spectrum, reflecting back the greenish bits. But if
I know anything about approximating the sun as a blackbody, I know that
it has a peak output of around 550 nm (i.e. green) light. So what's
going on? Why are plants blatantly rejecting the most abundant kind of
light? Since my initial confusion rested on the assumption of the sun as
a blackbody, I decided to take a closer look at the actual spectrum of
the sun. Below is a graph showing the frequency dependence of solar
radiation incident on the top of the atmosphere and at sea level. Since
plants typically don't live in space, we are most concerned with the sea
level plot.
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_xmXr6HTaI/AAAAAAAAACw/weKj6XTaf4M/s1600/Solar_Spectrum.png"><img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_xmXr6HTaI/AAAAAAAAACw/weKj6XTaf4M/s400/Solar_Spectrum.png"></a>
From this plot, it looks like the incident radiation from the sun is
fairly level beyond about 450nm or so. Just going on this graph alone,
it looks like plants could just absorb reddish light and do alright for
themselves. But do they? Let's take a look at the absorption spectrum of
chlorophyll. As it turns out there are a bunch of different "flavors" of
chlorophyll (chlorophyll a, b, c, and d). As far as I could gather, only
a and b are important (a is found in just about everything that plays
the photosynthesis game and b is found in plants and green algae). So we
need to find the absorption spectrum of chlorophyll a and b. After
looking for a while at very qualitative drawings, I found this
<a href="http://omlc.ogi.edu/spectra/PhotochemCAD/html/alpha.html">neato-toledo
site</a>, which
actually gives real live data. Plotting the results, we get the figure
below.
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_xpZIEtjkI/AAAAAAAAAC4/B7RknYpI63w/s1600/chlorophyll.png"><img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_xpZIEtjkI/AAAAAAAAAC4/B7RknYpI63w/s400/chlorophyll.png"></a>
Comparing with our handy dandy wavelength-to-color converter below we
see that there is a big peak in absorption of both chlorophyll a and b
in the dark blue and lesser peaks in the red.
<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_xqlbrKz0I/AAAAAAAAADA/fsx_JmlD5Ks/s1600/spectrum.gif"><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_xqlbrKz0I/AAAAAAAAADA/fsx_JmlD5Ks/s320/spectrum.gif"></a>
So how do these absorption lines correspond to the incident light at sea
level given above. Well, its kind of tough to check by eye, but it looks
like chlorophyll has its biggest peaks right below the plateau in the
solar spectrum. Marking the wavelengths of the absorption peaks makes
this clear (a = blue, b = green). It seems like plants are using a
sub-optimal band of the spectrum!
<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_xrLFfWBXI/AAAAAAAAADI/NwShTicac9A/s1600/solarwithchlorphyll.png"><img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_xrLFfWBXI/AAAAAAAAADI/NwShTicac9A/s400/solarwithchlorphyll.png"></a>
So how do we reconcile this? Well, let's first start at The Beginning.
The first photosynthetic organisms developed and spent the first billion
or so years of their existence living and evolving in the oceans. The
solar spectrum we have been using so far has been accurate only in air
at sea level. Presumably it would be favorable for the organism to be
able to survive at some finite depth in the ocean and not merely at the
surface. Thus we must consider the effects of water on our incident
solar radiation. A plot of the absorption spectrum of water is shown
below (note the log-log scale).
<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_xwl48ZUSI/AAAAAAAAADQ/kPVlOauL1o4/s1600/water+absorption.gif"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_xwl48ZUSI/AAAAAAAAADQ/kPVlOauL1o4/s400/water+absorption.gif"></a>
Lo and behold, the minimum absorption of visible light in water occurs
towards the far end in the blue. And this is exactly where our biggest
absorption peak in of chlorophyll is! Comparing our two graphs we see
that the ratio of incident blue light to incident green light at see
level is at worst about a third. But we see that for each meter traveled
in water, green light is absorbed almost ten times more than blue light.
Thus, an organism that lives a few meters underwater and wants to
harness solar energy would probably do best to focus on that blue light.
[WARNING: The next bit is speculative and I haven't taken a bio class
since high school] As much as I gather about chlorophyll from Wikipedia
and other semi-reputable sites, chlorophyll a is found in just about
anything that photosynthesizes, BUT chlorophyll b is only found in
plants and green algae. And apparently, land plants are largely
descended from green algae (which are aquatic, but typically around the
surface and around the shoreline). Now take a look at the chlorophyll
absorption spectra again. The chlorophyll b spectrum is sort of squished
in more towards the middle (towards 550 nm maybe?) than chlorophyll a.
In fact, on the graph where I have drawn lines on the solar spectra
graph where the chlorophyll peaks are, we see that chlorophyll b just
barely gets up to that plateau region. This suggests to me that
chlorophyll a was working just fine for the early aquatic plants, but
once they reached land and got out of all that water it became an
advantage to utilize light closer to the peak solar output. Thus, plants
that had chlorophyll b in addition to a had a slight advantage over
their b-less brethren. Or so I shall continue to shamelessly speculate
(and, apparently, alliterate). Anyway, I thought that was kind of cool,
but if I have made some horrible error or mangled some biology, please
let me know!</p>

are familiar with a little quirk of international flights: the flights
home are shorter. Specifically, going from Tel Aviv to New York takes
about one hour longer than going the other way around. This is an
oddity, and the very first explanation that comes to mind the rotation
of the Earth. After all, our naive image of a plane going up in the air
might be something a little like a rock being thrown up from a moving
cart, and we would imagine the plane to pick up some relative speed by
not rotating as fast as the Earth. Is this a factor in the plane's
movement? This gives us a perfect chance to use the Earth Units we
<a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/04/earth-day-earth-units.html">introduced</a>
a few weeks ago. Specifically I'll use the Earth meter (equal to the
radius of the Earth, which I'll dub e-m) and Earth second (one day,
e-s). First we want to figure out velocity of the airplane compared to
the ground. When it is grounded, the plane and the Earth's surface both
have an angular velocity of 2π 1/e-s; they do one revolution per day.
This means the plane's linear velocity is 2π e-m/e-s, and its angular
velocity once it's airborne is $$2 \pi \cdot \frac{(1\;
\rm{m_\oplus})}{(1\; \rm{m_\oplus}+A)}
\;\rm{s_\oplus^{-1}},$$ where A is the altitude. That's the one
number I'm going to pull out of thin air here; that being the thin air
of the cabin where they always announce that we have attained a cruising
altitude of 30,000 feet. In real people units, that's about 9,000
meters, or 9 kilometers - round it up to 10. Going back to the Earth day
<a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/04/earth-day-earth-units.html">post</a>
1 e-m is about 6380 km, so that the angular velocity of the airplane is
about 0.9984 (2π) 1/e-s, and relative to the ground it is $$0.0016
\cdot 2 \pi \;\rm{s_\oplus^{-1}}$$ So, over a journey of length
of about 0.5 e-s, the overall distance traveled due to this effect would
come to about $$0.0008 \cdot 2\pi \;\rm{m_\oplus}.$$ Tel Aviv and
New York are both in the mid-northern hemisphere and seven time zones
apart, so a first-order estimate of the distance between them would be
about $$\frac{7}{24}\cdot 2\pi \;\rm{m_\oplus} \approx
0.29\cdot 2\pi \;\rm{m_\oplus}.$$ Overall, it looks like this
effect is negligible. Indeed, anyone who gives the matter a second
thought would notice that the planes should go faster when traveling
westwards, as the Earth spins eastwards toward the rising sun. Anyone
who looks even further into the matter finds that eastbound and
westbound planes simply take different routes across the Atlantic,
leaving us with a rather more mundane and less exciting explanation.
Still, I won't complain if it makes my flight any shorter. Now, if
you'll excuse me, I have some beaches to catch up with.</p>

<p>So, some you may remember when I attempted to calculate how much the
oceans would lower if you took out all of the fish in an <a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/04/fishy-calculation.html">earlier
post</a>.
Well, the results came in a while ago, but I forgot to mention that <a href="http://diaryofnumbers.blogspot.com/2010/05/we-have-winner.html">I
lost</a>
the contest. I was about two orders of magnitude off from the winning
answer. In light of my failure, I'm going to try again in the <a href="http://diaryofnumbers.blogspot.com/2010/05/hamster-powered-mansions.html">newest
contest</a>.
This time the question is a bit stranger:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How many buff hamsters would it take to completely power a mansion?</p>

                    <p>What we usually do here at the The Virtuosi is take an interesting
problem, and work out the physical principles behind what we're seeing.
Or pose a question and try to answer it. Now, I'm a big fan of this kind
of thing, which is why I've done so much of it. But I worry that it
might give a slightly skewed view of physics. Sure, physics explains
things. That's why we do it. But not everything in physics is <a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/04/laser-gun-recoil-follow-up.html">laser
guns</a>
and <a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/05/solar-sails-i.html">solar
sails</a>.
There are a lot of interesting physics phenomena that the general public
will never hear about, because they're just too, well, esoteric. What
I'm going to do is occasionally talk about such effects, and, for some
of them, give you applications for these strange effects you might see
on a day-to-day basis. Today I'm going to examine the Hall effect. The
Hall effect is simple, as these things go, once we understand the
pieces. The first piece is that magnetic fields deflect moving
electrically charged particles. I don't think I can give you a good
simple reason for this, you're just going to have to trust me (for those
interested, I'd argue that the relativistic transformation of a magnetic
field is an electric field, and that will certainly deflect an
electrically charged particle). This is a piece of the Lorentz force.
The next piece that we need to know is that opposite electrically
charged particles attract. So a positively charged particle attracts a
negatively charged particle. Knowing those two things we can detail the
Hall effect.
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_SYZpxZOlcb0/S_nxJSw3bQI/AAAAAAAAABU/Mi2_jDtskus/s1600/Hall+effect+pos.JPG"><img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_SYZpxZOlcb0/S_nxJSw3bQI/AAAAAAAAABU/Mi2_jDtskus/s320/Hall+effect+pos.JPG"></a>
Take the slab pictured above. We run an electric current through it.
Conventionally we take current as moving positively charged particles.
There is a magnetic field into the screen. This deflects the positive
charges up the screen, as shown, with some upward force. Over some time,
we will accumulate positive charges at the top. Because there is no net
charge in our slab, this must leave a region of negative charge at the
bottom. These regions of charge will attract, and cancel out the force
from the magnetic field. This charge separation results in a voltage
differential between the two sides of the slab, which is what we
actually measure. The Hall effect has some nifty consequences
physically. I mentioned that conventionally we take current to be
positive particles moving. A microscopic picture of our conductors will
tell us that, in general, electrons are what we consider to be flowing
in an electric current. Now, it turns out that our magnetic field will
deflect electrons moving opposite our current direction (negative
current moving backwards is the same as positive current moving
forwards) to the same side as our hypothetical positive particles got
deflected to. This generates a charge differential with negative and
positive charges on the opposite sides of the slab (shown below), which
means the voltage is negative what we would have measured above! This
means we expect to get a certain sign of the measured Hall voltage,
which we can predict. This sign would correspond to negative particles
(electrons) being the moving charge carriers in substances. It turns out
that there are some substances (some semiconductors) where the sign of
the Hall voltage is opposite what we expect from electrons. This means
that in those substances the current is being carried by positive
particles! I won't explain what that means here (I may address that in a
later post), but I hope you can see why that would be fascinating. We
expected to have electrons moving, and it turns out that something else
is really doing the moving. The Hall effect is an experimental result
that helped suggest a whole new way of thinking about conduction in
materials.

Beyond being very interesting physics, there are some applications to
this effect. It is an easy way to create a magnetic field sensor. Take a
slab of material, run a current through it, and measure the voltage on
the sides. Where do we use magnetic field sensors? Well, they sometimes
show up as a way to tell if something is open or closed. Put a magnet in
your lid, and a Hall effect sensor in the lip the lid rests on. When it
is closed, you'll measure a voltage, and when it is open you won't. Now
you can tell if it is open or closed. A little imagination, and you can
see how this would be useful for all kinds of switches. Hit the switch,
move your magnet, and change your voltage. According to Wikipedia, Hall
effect switches are used in things as diverse as paintball guns and
go-cart speed controls. They could also be used as a speed or
acceleration measurement in a rotating system. Attach a magnet to the
rotating object, put a sensor at a fixed location, and measure how the
voltage in your sensor changes as the object sweeps past it. There are
many more applications, but this is just to give you a taste of how this
seemingly esoteric physics concept may show up in your everyday life.
It's not just the interesting problems we often work on this blog,
physics is everywhere. In many different guises</p>

<p>Summer is upon us, and so that means that we here at the Virtuosi have
started talking about baseball. In fact, Corky and I did some simple
calculations that illuminate just how impressive batting in baseball can
be. We were interested in just how hard it is to hit a pitch with the
bat. So we thought we'd model hitting the ball with a rather simple
approximation of a robot swinging a cylindrical bat, horizontally with
some rotational speed and at a random height. The question then becomes,
if the robot chooses a random height and a random time to swing, what
are the chances that it gets a hit?</p>
<h4>Spatial Resolution</h4>
<p>So the first thing to consider is how much of the strike zone the bat
takes up. In order to be a strike, the ball needs to be over home plate,
which is 17 inches wide, and between the knees and logo on the batters
jersey. Estimating this height as 0.7 m or 28 inches or so, we have the
area of the strike zone $$ A_S = (17") \times (0.7 m) = 0.3 \text{
m}^2 $$ when you swing, how much of this area does the bat take up?
Well, treat it as a cylinder, with a diameter of 10 cm, and assume it
runs the length of the strike zone, when the area that the bat takes up
is $$ A_B = (10\text{ cm}) \times (17" ) = 0.043 \text{ m}^2 $$ So
that the fractional area that the bat takes up during our idealized
swing is $$ \frac{A_B}{A_S} \approx 14\% $$ So already, if our
robot is guessing where inside the strike zone to place the bat, and
doing so randomly, assuming the pitch is a strike to begin with, it will
be able to bunt successfully about 14% of the time.</p>
<h4>Time Resolution</h4>
<p>But getting a hit on a swing is different than getting a bunt. Not only
do you have to have your bat at the right height, but you need to time
the swing correctly. Lets first look at how much time we are dealing
with here. Most major league pitchers pitch the ball at about 90 mph or
so. The pitchers mound is 60.5 feet away from home base. This means that
the pitch is in the air for $$ t = \frac{ 60.5 \text{ ft} }{ 90
\text{ mph} } \approx \frac{1}{2} \text{ second} $$ i.e. from the
time the pitcher releases the ball to the time it crosses home plate is
only about half a second. Compare this with human reaction times. My
drivers ed course told me that human reaction times are typically a
third of a second or so. So, baseball happens quick! Alright, but we
were interested in how well you have to time your swing. Successfully
hitting the ball means that you've made contact with the ball such that
it lands somewhere in the field. I.e. you've got a 90 degree play in
when you make contact. How does this translate to time? We would need to
know how fast you swing.</p>
<h5>Estimating the speed of a swing</h5>
<p>I don't know how fast you can swing a baseball bat, but I can estimate
it. I know that if you land your swing just right, you have a pretty
good shot at a home run. Fields are typically 300 feet long. So, I can
ask, if I launch a projectile at a 45 degree angle, how fast does it
need to be going in order to make it 300 feet. Well, we can solve this
projectile problem if we remember some of our introductory physics. We
decouple the horizontal and vertical motions of the ball, the ball
travels horizontally 300 feet, so we know $$ v_x t = 300 \text{ ft} $$
where t is the time the ball is in the air, similarly we know that it is
gravity that makes the ball fall, and so as far the vertical motion is
concerned, in half the total flight time, we need the vertical velocity
to go from its initial value to zero, i.e. $$ g \frac{t}{2} = v_y $$
where g is the acceleration due to gravity. Furthermore, I'm assuming
that I am launching this projectile at a 45 degree angle, for which I
know from trig that $$ v_x = v_y = \frac{v}{\sqrt 2} $$ So I can
stick these equations into one another and solve for the velocity needed
to get the ball going 300 feet. $$ \frac{v^2}{ g} = 300 \text{ ft} =
\frac{ v^2}{ 9.8 \text{ m/s}^2 } $$ $$ v \approx 30 \text{ m/s}
\sim 67 \text{ mph}$$ So it looks like the ball needs to leave the bat
going about 70 mph in order to clear the park. ( This was of course
neglecting air resistance, which ought to be important for baseballs ).
Great that tells us how fast the ball needs to be going when it leaves
the bat, but how fast was the bat going in order to get the ball going
that fast? Well, lets work worst case and assume that the baseball - bat
interaction is inelastic. I.e. I reckon that if I throw a baseball at
about 100 mph towards a wooden wall, it doesn't bounce a whole lot. In
that case, the bat needs to take the ball from coming at it at 90 mph to
leaving at 70 mph or so, i.e. the place where the ball hits the bat
needs to be going at about 160 mph. That seems fast, but when you think
about it, if a pitcher can pitch a ball at 90 mph, that means their hand
is moving at 90 mph during the last bits of the pitch, so you expect
that a batter can move their hands about that fast, and we have the
added advantage of the bat being a lever.</p>
<h5>Coming back to timing</h5>
<p>So, we have an estimate for how fast the bat is going. Knowing this and
estimating the length between the sweet spot and the pivot point of the
bat to be about 0.75 m or so, we can obtain the angular frequency of the
bat. $$ v = \omega r $$ $$ \omega = \frac{ 160 \text{ mph} }{ 0.75
\text{ m} } \approx 100 \text{ Hz} $$ So, if we need to have a 90
degree resolution in our swing timing to hit the ball in the park, this
means that if our swing near the end is happening at 100 \text{ Hz}, we
need to get the timing down to within $$ t = \frac{ 90 \text{
degree}}{ 100 \text{ Hz} } \sim 15 \text{ ms} $$ So we need to get
the timing of our swing to within about 15 milliseconds to land the hit.
So if our robot randomly swung at some point during the duration of the
pitch, it would only hit with probability $$ \frac{\text{time to land
hit} }{ \text{time of pitch}} = \frac{ 15 \text{ ms}}{500 \text{
ms}} \sim 3\% $$ or only 3% of the time. If we take both the spatial
placement, and timing of the swing as independent, the probability that
our robot gets a hit would be something about $$ p = 0.03 \times 0.14 =
0.004 = 0.4 \% $$ or our robot would only get a hit 1 time out of 250
tries. Suddenly hitting looks pretty impressive.</p>
<h4>Experiment</h4>
<p>Saying that the robot swings at some random time during the duration of
the pitch is pretty bad. So I decided to do a little experiment to see
how good people are at judging times on half second scales. I had some
friends of mine start a stop watch and while looking try to stop it as
close as they could at the half second mark. Collecting their
deviations, I obtained a standard deviation of about 41 milliseconds,
which suggests a window of about 100 milliseconds over which people can
reliably judge half second intervals. Now, I have to admit, this wasn't
done in any very rigorous sort of way, I had them do this while walking
to dinner, but it ought to give a rough estimate of the relevant time
scale for landing a hit. So instead of comparing our 15 millisecond 'get
a hit' window to the full half second pitch duration, lets compare it
instead to the 100 'humans trying to judge when to hit' window. This
gives us a temporal resolution of about $$ p = \frac{ 15}{100} = 15
\%. $$ So that now we obtain an overall hit probability of $$ p = 0.15
* 0.14 = 0.021 = 2 \% $$ So that it seems like a poor baseball player,
more or less randomly swinging should have a batting average of about
2\%. Compare this with typical baseball batting averages of 250 or so,
denoting 0.25 or 25% probability of a hit. I think this is a much better
estimate of how much better over random baseball players can do with
training. So it looks like practice can improve your ability to do a
task by about an order of magnitude or so. Either way, baseball is
pretty darn impressive when you think about it.</p>

<p>I thought I'd take another look at cell phone damage, coming at it from
a different direction than my colleague. Mostly I just want to consider
the energy of the radiation that cell phones produce, and compare that
with the other relevant energy scales for molecules.</p>
<h4>Cell Phone Energy</h4>
<p>So, lets start with cell phones. I looked at my cell phone battery, and
it looks like it is rated for 1 A, at 3.5 V. So when it is running at
its peak it should put out about 3.5 W of power in electromagnetic waves
(assuming it reaches its rating and all of that energy is fully
converted into radiation). But what form does this energy take? Well,
its electromagnetic radiation, so its in the form of a bunch of photons.
In order to determine the energy of each photon, we need to know the
frequency of the radiation. Surfing around a bit on wikipedia, I
discovered that most cell phones operate in the 33 cm radio band, or
somewhere between about 800 - 900 Mhz. How much energy does each \~ 1
Ghz photon have? We know that the energy of a photon is: $$ E = h \nu
\sim 7 \times 10^{-25} \text{ J} \sim 4 \times 10^{-6} \text{
eV} $$ it will be convenient to know the photon energy in "eV's". 1 eV
is the energy of a single electron accelerated through a potential of 1
volt, or $$ 1 eV = (1 \text{ electron charge} ) * ( 1 \text{ Volt} )
= 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J} $$ So my cell phone is sending out
signals using a bunch of photons, each of which has an energy of about 4
micro eVs. Lets consider the energy scales involved in most molecular
processes and compare those scales with this energy.</p>
<h4>Molecules</h4>
<p>Great. We have a number. What what does it mean? A number in physics
means little without some context. Lets try and consider what photons
can do to molecules. I can think of three different processes: first, a
photon could knock out an electron (i.e. ionize the molecule), second
the photon could make the molecule vibrate or wiggle, or third the
photon could make the molecule rotate. Lets see if we can estimate the
energies for these three different types of processes. Lets first
collect some of the information we know about atoms and molecules so
that we can continue our estimations. I know that most atoms are about
an angstrom big, or 10^(-10} meters. I know the charge of an electron
and proton.</p>
<h5>Ionization</h5>
<p>What are typical molecular ionization energies? Well we could try and
estimate it. Whats the energy stored in an electron and proton being
about an angstrom apart? Well, remembering some of our electrostatics we
have $$ E = \frac{ k q_1 q_2 }{ r} \sim (9 \times 10^9) \frac{
(1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C} )^2 }{ (1 \ \AA)} \sim 14 \text{
eV} $$ which is pretty darn close to the ionization energy of hydrogen
at 13.6 eV. So I will claim that since all atoms are about the same
size, typical ionization energies across the board are about 10 eV, in
order of magnitude.</p>
<h5>Vibration</h5>
<p>What about making our molecules vibrate? Well what are the energies of
molecular bonds? They ought to be quite similar to the ionization
energies of molecules, but as we know they are a tad weaker. Bond
energies for most molecules are on the order of a few eV. The
oxygen-hydrogen bond in water for example has a binding energy of 5.2
eV. What does that have to do with vibration? Well, if we consider a
material as made up by a bunch of atoms all stuck together with springs,
we can estimate the spring constant. Assuming that a typical binding
energy of 3 eV or so, and a typical atomic separation of 1 angstrom or
so, we can estimate the spring constant for atoms, knowing $$ U =
\frac{1}{2} k x^2 $$ $$ 3 \text{ eV } \approx \frac{1}{2} k ( 1 \A
)^2 $$ $$ k \approx 100 \text{ N/m} $$ And now having estimated the
spring constant, we can estimate how much energy there is in a quanta of
atomic vibration, i.e. figure out the corresponding frequency from $$
\omega = \sqrt{ k / m } $$ and quantize it in units of hbar. We
discover that a quanta of atomic vibration typically has energies on the
order of $$ U = \hbar \omega = \hbar \sqrt{ \frac{ k }{ m } } $$ $$
= 6.6 \times 10^{-16} \text{ eV s } \sqrt{ \frac{ 100 \text{ N/m}
}{ 2 \times \text{ mass of a proton } } } \sim 0.1 \text{ eV} $$ So
molecular vibration energies are about a tenth of an electron volt.</p>
<h5>Rotation</h5>
<p>I can also make molecules rotate. What is the energy of the lowest
rotational mode of a molecule. Well, bohr taught us that angular
momentum is quantized in units of h, planck's constant. Imagine a two
atom molecule, with two atoms separated by an angstrom. The energy of a
rotating object can be written $$ E = \frac{ L^2 }{2 I } $$ in analogy
to the energy of a moving object $$ E = \frac{ p^2 }{2m} $$ where I is
the moment of inertia for a molecule. We will estimate $$ I = 2 m r^2
\sim 2 (1 * \text{ mass of proton} * ( 1 \text{ \AA} )^2 \sim 3
\times 10^{-47} \text{ kg m}^2 $$ So we can estimate the rotational
energy for a small molecule $$ E = \frac{ h^2 }{ 2 m r^2 } \sim 80
\text{ meV} $$ and this is for a small molecule, and will only go down
for larger molecules, as I will increase. So I will call typical
rotational energies 1 meV for medium sized molecules.</p>
<h4>Heat</h4>
<p>Another relevant energy scale to discuss when we are talking about
brains is the energy due to the fact that our brain is rather warm. Body
temperature is about 98 degrees Fahrenheit, or 37 degrees Celsius, or
310 Kelvin. Statistical Mechanics tells us that temperature is an
average energy for a system, and in fact the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equipartition_theorem">Equipartition
theorem</a> tells us
that when a body is in thermal equilibrium, every mode of it has $$
\frac{1}{2} k_B T $$ amount of energy in it. For our brain that means
$$ E = \frac{1}{2} k_B T = 2 \times 10^{-21} \text{ J } = 13
\text{ meV} $$ i.e. just the fact that our brains are hot means that
every degree of freedom in our brain already has 13 millielectron volts
associated with it. Comparing to our results above, this is comparable
to the rotational energies of molecules, but a tad less than their
vibrational energies, which means that we should expect most of the
molecules in our head to already be rotating.</p>
<h4>Results</h4>
<p>So going through some very rough calculations, we discovered that for
molecules, there are three obvious ways you can get them hot and
bothered, you can ionize them, make them wiggle, or make them rotate.
There are some typical energy scales for these things, ionization
energies are about 10 eV, vibrational energies are about 0.1 eV, and
rotational energies are about 0.001 eV. In addition, our brain already
has about 13 meV of energy in every one of its degrees of freedom, and
cell phone photons have an energy some 1/3300 of this. And what was the
energy for each cell phone photon? 0.000004 eV. Notice that this energy
is about a hundred times weaker than typical rotational energies, and
some 3300 thousandth times less than the natural thermal energy in our
brains. Now you can begin to understand why most physicists are not too
worried about the effects of cell phones. The radiation from cell phones
is just not on the kind of energy scales that affect molecules in was
that could potentially harm us. So I'm not too worried.</p>

One thing that I've wanted to quantify since reading <em>Intelligent Life
in the Universe</em>, an outstanding book by Carl Sagan and I.S. Shklovskii,
is the idea of exogenesis. Exogenesis is the hypothesis that life formed
elsewhere in the universe and was somehow transferred to earth in the
form of some small seed or spore. Now since E.T. E. coli presumably do
not have little tiny jetpacks or other means of active transport, they
would need to traverse the cosmos in some passive way. One such way
would be solar sailing.
Way back in Solar Sails I, we derived equations describing the maximum
speeds and time-of-travel for various distances for a given solar sail.
Each of these equations was a function of the surface mass density of
the sail, which is just the amount of mass per unit cross-sectional
area. All we need to know is the cross-sectional area and mass of a
given object and we can apply these equations to just about anything!
Assume we have some spherical blob with the density of water (1g/cm^3).
The effective sigma of this blob would just be the mass divided by the
cross-sectional area. In other words,
$$ \sigma = \frac{m}{Area} = \frac{\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \rho}{\pi
r^2} = \frac{4}{3}\rho r .$$
Rearranging to get r in terms of the other variables, we have
$$ r = \frac{3\sigma}{4\rho} . $$
Plugging in our density of 1g/cm^3 and a suitable sigma (10^-4
g/cm^2), we get
$$ r \le 0.75 \times 10^{-4} cm = 0.75 \mu m .$$
Check out
<a href="http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/begin/cells/scale/">this</a> fun
site to see what kind of critters can fit in this blob.
From the previous post, we saw that for a sigma of 10^-4 g/cm^2, our
sail would get to the nearest stars on a timescale of order 10,000
years. Thus if our blob has a radius of less than about a micron, it
could spread to hundreds of stars in around 10,000-100,000 years. Even
if it would take millions of years, that would be almost no time at all
on the cosmic scale. Just based on this calculation it all seems fairly
feasible.
In making these calculations I have neglected several important aspects
of the problem. First, in no way have I actually calculated any sort of
probability of this happening. Additionally, I would have to see how
likely it is for some blob to reach planetary escape velocity
(presumably just by riding that tail of the Boltzmann distribution).
Finally, and perhaps most important of all, I have not given any sort of
motivation or mechanism by which some living body could survive hundreds
of thousands of years in the vacuum of space with constant radiation
exposure. But I have heard that some forms of life are totally
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremophile">extreme</a> (especially if they
drink <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Dew">this</a>).
Even though such a process seems possible, it certainly doesn't seem
like the easiest way to get life on earth. I prefer the much more
satisfying "amino acids + lightning + magic =
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis">life</a>" model. But it does
offer some interesting possibilities. Suppose we as people think that
people are super awesome and therefore people should be everywhere. We
do some bio magic and put whatever DNA we want into viruses, which we
then pack into as many micron spheres as we can make. We then point them
at the nearest stars and have them disperse.
What would the probabilities be that they land somewhere habitable? Are
there any ethical considerations in doing this? Is it a galactic faux
pas?</p>
