                    <p><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Convection-snapshot.gif"></a>We
have received our first <em>Ask a Physicist</em> e-query! An entity known only
to us as "Hungry" writes:
"We had a dispute at a dinner party about whether blowing on hot food
actually makes it cool down faster, or only gives you something to do
while you wait for your food to cool."
While it is questionable whether or not I am indeed a physicist (but
people do pay me to do physics) and whether I will answer definitively
(there'll be some hand-waving), I'll give it my darndest.
Let's imagine a hot baked potato you just sliced open. The mass of
potato is capable of transferring energy as heat to the surrounding air
(and therefore cooling down) via a number of mechanisms. The most common
we hear about are conduction, radiation, and convection. Conduction is
the process by which two objects in intimate contact exchange heat.
Radiation is a bit more mysterious, but in the same way that a poker in
the fire can glow white hot, all things at non-zero temperature emit
electromagnetic radiation, which carries away energy from your potato.
Convection is even more complicated, but is one of the most important
processes by which solids exchange heat with gases. Convection in our
case occurs when the potato heats up the gas at its surface. The random
motion of air molecules (now a little hotter) will "randomly" dissipate
heat. However, the hotter gas is less dense than the room temperature
gas, and buoyant forces (think Helium balloon) will create a current of
hot gas upwards from the potato surface. Both of these processes
constitute convection.
Convection is REALLY hard to describe with physical models. You can do
some computer simulations of the motion of the gas in convection. I
found this cool picture on Wikipedia of someone who did just that:
<a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Convection-snapshot.gif"><img alt="image" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Convection-snapshot.gif"></a>
Pretty cool. Now! To actually answer your question. To get a qualitative
answer, we don't even need to consider models of convection, etc. Isaac
Newton was kind enough to find an empirical relation for the process of
cooling, aptly named "Newton's law of cooling". If we call the amount of
heat transferred from the potato Q, the found that the rate of heat
being lost by the potato is proportional to the temperature difference
between the surrounding gas and the potato itself:
$$ \text{Rate of Heat Loss}=\frac{\text{Amount of Heat
Loss}}{\text{Amount of time}}=\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t} \propto
T_{\text{Potato}}-T_{\text{Air }} $$ So the quantity which is of
primary importance is the temperature difference between your potato and
the surrounding air. Now we can answer the question. If you let your
potato cool down naturally, then the potato heats the air which then
starts to convect. This means that the air immediately above the potato
is quite hot. If you blow on the potato, however, you get the air
circulating faster than it would by convection alone, effectively
replacing the hot air with slightly cooler air. And since the cooling
rate is proportional to to temperature difference; this will result in a
faster cooling rate. To first order, blowing on your food should help.
So, Hungry, feel free to blow on your food, Miss Manners be damned.</p>

                    <p>[NOTE: In my hurry to make up for weeks of non-posts, I managed to
almost immediately knock Nic's <a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/05/why-black-holes-from-large-hadron.html">first
post</a>
from the top of the page. It's got the LHC, black holes, and about 3
full cups of metric awesome, so make sure you check it out (after
reading this one, of course).]
Last time we did some calculations on how fast and far our solar sails
can go, but those calculations were just for the sail itself. If you are
going to do any science with it, you're going to need a payload. Let's
take it a step further and make it an actual spaceship (with people and
everything!).
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_DXvcSsDXI/AAAAAAAAACg/jK_N-B4mOME/s1600/ssradius.png"></a>
Comparing it with a typical people-carrying space hotel (the
International Space Station), let's give our payload a mass of 300,000
kg. Remembering from the last post that a sigma of less that about
10^-4 g/cm^2 gave fairly nice results, we can make an effective sigma
of our payload carrying sail as
$$ \sigma_{eff} = \frac{m_{total}}{Area} = \frac{m_s +
m_p}{Area}, $$
where m_s is the mass of the sail and m_p is the mass of our payload
(the ship). Assuming the sail has some surface density of sigma and the
sail is circular with some radius r, we have
$$ \sigma_{eff} = \frac{\pi r^2 {\sigma}<em eff>s + m_p}{\pi r^2} =
{\sigma}_s + \frac{m_p}{\pi r^2} . $$
Now we can find the radius of our sail such that
$$ \sigma</em> \le 10^{-4} \frac{g}{{cm}^2}. $$
Rearranging our equation above and solving for radius, we find that
$$ r \ge \left[\frac{m_p}{\pi \left( 10^{-4}\frac{g}{cm^2} -
\sigma_s \right)} \right]^{1/2} cm. $$
Below is a plot of sail radius (in meters) against sail surface density
(g/cm^2).
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_DXvcSsDXI/AAAAAAAAACg/jK_N-B4mOME/s1600/ssradius.png"><img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_DXvcSsDXI/AAAAAAAAACg/jK_N-B4mOME/s400/ssradius.png"></a>
From this plot, we see that we will need our sail radius to be AT LEAST
10 km and the surface density of our sail must be less than 10^-4
g/cm^2. Now that's a big sail, but it's not obscenely big (depending,
of course, on your definitions of obscenity). One could certainly
imagine such a sail being built, but it would be an impressive
engineering feat.
So get to work engineers! I've already made a whole plot in Mathematica,
I can't do everything.</p>

Solar sails are in the news again, and this time not just for <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/06/22/tech/main703405.shtml">blowing
up</a>.
The Japanese space agency is
<a href="http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/japan-venus-double-mission-100516.html">launching</a>
what they hope to be the first successful solar sail tomorrow. In honor
of that, we will be discussing the physics of solar sails.
First of all, what the heck are solar sails? Solar sails are a means of
propulsion based on the simple observation that "Hey, sails work on
boats. Therefore, they should work on interplanetary spacecraft (in
space)." Boat sails work when air molecules hit into the sail and bounce
back. By conservation of momentum, this gives the boat sail an itty
bitty boost in momentum. Summing over the large number of air molecules
moving as wind, the boat gets pushed along in the water. A similar
process works with solar sails, but instead of air molecules doing the
hitting, it's photons. Since each photon of a given wavelength has some
momentum, by reflecting that photon the solar sail can gain a tiny bit
of momentum. Summing over the large number of photons coming from the
sun over a long time frame we can get a considerable boost. So let's see
how good solar sails are.
First we need to find the net force on our sail. We will certainly have
to deal with gravitational forces (which will slow us down) :
$$ F_{g} = \frac{-GM_{\odot}m}{r^2} $$
where big M is the mass of the sun and little m is the mass of the sail.
Now we need to find the radiation force on the sail. Since force is just
rate of change of momentum, we can find the change of momentum of one
photon per unit time, then find how many photons are hitting our sail.
So for one elastic collision of a photon with the sail, the change in
momentum will be
$$ \Delta p = 2 \frac{h\nu}{c} $$
and by conservation of momentum, this will also be the momentum gained
by the sail. Now we want to find the number of photons incident on a
given area in a given time. This will just be the energy flux output by
the sun ( energy/ m^2 s ) divided by the energy per photon. In other
words:
$$ f_n = \frac{L_{\odot}}{4\pi r^2}\frac{1}{h\nu} .$$
So now we can get a force by
$$ \text{Force} = \left(\frac{\Delta p}{\text{1 photon}} \right)
\times \left(\frac{\text{number of photons}}{area \times
time}\right) \times \left( Area\right) $$
which is just
$$ F_{rad} = 2 \frac{h\nu}{c} \times \frac{L_\odot}{4\pi r^2
h\nu} \times \pi R^2 = \frac{L_{\odot} R^2}{2cr^2} .$$
So combining the radiation force with the gravitation force, we have a
net force on the sail of
$$ F = \left( \frac{L_{\odot} R^2}{2c} - GM_{\odot}m \right)
\frac{1}{r^2} .$$
This can then be integrated over r to find an effective potential,
giving:
$$ U = \left( \frac{L_{\odot} R^2}{2c} -
GM_{\odot}m\right)\frac{1}{r} .$$
For simplicity, let's just write that
$$ \alpha = \frac{L_{\odot} R^2}{2c} - GM_{\odot}m $$
so
$$ U = \frac{\alpha}{r} .$$
Now we can start saying some things about this sail. The most
straightforward quantity to find would be the maximum velocity. By
conservation of energy (and starting from some r_0 at rest), we have
that
$$ v_f = \left[\frac{2\alpha}{m} \left(\frac{1}{r_0} -
\frac{1}{r_f} \right) \right]^{1/2} $$
So as r_f goes to very large values, the subtracted piece gets smaller
and smaller. In the limit that r_f goes to infinity we have that
$$ v_{max} = \left(\frac{2\alpha}{mr_0}\right)^{1/2} .$$
Plugging back in our long term for alpha and plugging in some numbers we
get:
$$ v_{max} = 42,000 m/s \left( \frac{1.5 \times 10^{-4}}{\sigma} -
1\right)^{1/2} $$
where sigma is just the surface mass density [g/cm^2] of the sail.
Below is a plot of maximum velocity ( m/s) plotted against surface mass
density (g/cm^2). For a sigma of 10^-4 g/cm^2, we get a max velocity
of about 30,000 m/s. Not bad.
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_CjbwxG-JI/AAAAAAAAAB4/PS7tTqbmLUE/s1600/maxvel.png"><img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_CjbwxG-JI/AAAAAAAAAB4/PS7tTqbmLUE/s400/maxvel.png"></a>
From this graph we see that there must be some maximum surface density,
above which we don't get any (forward) motion at all. This makes sense
since we want our radiation forces (which scale with area) to overcome
our gravitational forces (which scale with mass). And below this maximal
surface density we see a power law behavior. Cool.
We can also find the distance traveled as a function of time. Taking the
final velocity equation above and writing v as dr/dt, we see that
$$ \frac{dr}{dt} = \left[ \frac{2\alpha}{m} \left( \frac{1}{r_0}
- \frac{1}{r_f} \right)\right]^{1/2} $$
Rearranging and integrating, we can get time (in years) as a function of
distance r (in AU):
$$ t = \frac{0.11 \left(\sqrt{(-1+r)
r}+\text{Log}\left[1+\sqrt{\frac{-1+r}{r}}\right]+\frac{\text{Log}[r]}{2}\right)}{\sqrt{-1+\frac{1.5
\times 10^{-4}}{\sigma}}}$$
A plot of t vs. r is shown below for typical solar system distances and
a sigma of 10^-4 g/cm^2. We assume that we are launching from earth (1
AU). Since Pluto is at a distance of about 40 AU, we see that our sail
could get there in less than 7 years. For comparison, the <a href="http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/">New
Horizons</a> probe will use conventional
propulsion to get to Pluto in 9.5 years (and it is the fastest
spacecraft ever made).
<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_Ck6enlpVI/AAAAAAAAACI/_gjIHLCm_G8/s1600/ssplutolong.png"><img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_Ck6enlpVI/AAAAAAAAACI/_gjIHLCm_G8/s400/ssplutolong.png"></a>
Zooming in to our starting point around 1 AU, we see that there is a
period of acceleration and then the maximum velocity is reached after a
few months. Just eyeballing it, it looks like it takes at least a month
to reach appreciable speed. That it takes so long is a result of the
very small forces involved due to radiation pressure. But even a small
acceleration amounts to a considerable speed if applied for long enough!
<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_CopsUAIrI/AAAAAAAAACQ/_-IqCnf8xs8/s1600/sscloseup.png"><img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_CopsUAIrI/AAAAAAAAACQ/_-IqCnf8xs8/s400/sscloseup.png"></a>
Now Pluto is fine I guess (it's the second largest dwarf-planet!), but
how about some interstellar flight? Well, the nearest star is Proxima
Centauri which is about a parsec away. A parsec is 3<em>10^16 m, or about
200,000 AU. From, the plot below (or plugging in to the equation above),
we see that such a trip would take of order 10,000 years. That's a long
time, but its not too shabby considering this craft uses no fuel of its
own.
<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_Cgqa_fqDI/AAAAAAAAABw/xxgjj5VEZww/s1600/ssTOTHESTARS.png"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_Cgqa_fqDI/AAAAAAAAABw/xxgjj5VEZww/s400/ssTOTHESTARS.png"></a>
So solar sails can do some fairly impressive things simply by harnessing
the free energy of the sun. Though this only provides a very small
acceleration, it can be taken over a long enough time to be useful.
However, since the radiation pressure of the sun falls off as 1/r^2, we
start to observe diminishing returns and the sail reaches a max
velocity. But overall the numbers seem fairly impressive. All that
remains now is whether they are feasible to construct. Right now my only
data point for feasibility was that it was in <a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/starship/solarsailer/">Star
Wars</a>, but as I
recall that was a </em>long* time ago.</p>

integral in <a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/05/solar-sails-i.html">Solar Sails
I</a>. If you
just want some hints to do the integral, see <a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/05/solar-sails-addendum-ii.html">Solar Sails Addendum
II</a>.
Here we present a step-by-step solution of the differential equation: $$
\frac{dr}{dt} = \left[ \frac{2\alpha}{m} \left( \frac{1}{r_0} -
\frac{1}{r} \right)\right]^{1/2} $$ This is just a separable
equation, so we rearrange to get an integral equation: $$
\int_{r_0}^{r_f} \frac{dr}{\left[ \frac{2\alpha}{m} \left(
\frac{1}{r_0} - \frac{1}{r} \right)\right]^{1/2}}
=\int_{0}^{t}dt$$ We see that the right hand side here will just
evaluate to t. Let's rearrange the left hand side to get the integration
variable to be dimensionless. This is important because it allows the
integral to just be a number, with all the unit-dependent terms pulled
outside. So we have $$ \int_{r_0}^{r_f} \frac{dr}{\left[
\frac{2\alpha}{mr_0} \left( 1 - \frac{r_0}{r}
\right)\right]^{1/2}} =t$$ \noindent Now we can do a change of
variables to get the dimensionless variable u = r/r0. This is just
giving us our distance in terms of our initial distance. In the problem
I took r_0 to be 1 AU. So u just gives our distance now in terms of AU:
$$ \int_{1}^{u_f} \frac{du}{\left[ \frac{2\alpha}{m{r_0}^3}
\left( 1 - \frac{1}{u} \right)\right]^{1/2}} =t$$ So lets set $$ k
= (m{r_0}^3}/{2 \alpha)^{1/2} ,$$ which just gives $$
k\int_{1}^{u_f} \frac{du}{\left[ \left( 1 - \frac{1}{u}
\right)\right]^{1/2}} =t$$ Now we are ready to get started!
Typically, when I see something with a square root in the denominator
that's giving me trouble, I just blindly try trig substitutions. Let's
try u = [csc(x)]^2, so 1/u = [sin(x)]^2 and du = -(csc x)^2 * cot x,
and $$ \int_{1}^{u_f} \frac{du}{\left[ \left( 1 - \frac{1}{u}
\right)\right]^{1/2}} =\int_{x_0}^{x_f} \frac{-2\csc^2x \cot
x dx}{\left(1-\sin^2x \right)^{1/2}} = \int_{x_0}^{x_f}
-2\csc^3x dx ,$$ where x_0 = pi/2 and x_f = arcsin u_f . The last
equality above just comes from simplifying the trig expressions. So now
how do we solve this "easier" problem? As a wise man once said, "When in
doubt, integrate by parts." So let's try that. Expanding out a bit we
see that: $$ -\int_{x_0}^{x_f} \csc^3x dx =
\int_{x_0}^{x_f}\csc x \left(-\csc^2x \right)dx $$ Remembering
that integration by parts goes like $$ \int u dv = uv - \int v du $$
we can set u = csc x and v = \cot x$ to get $$
\int_{x_0}^{x_f}\csc x \left(-\csc^2x \right)dx = \csc x
\cot x \Big |<em x_0>{x_0}^{x_f} - \int</em>^{x_f} \cot x
\left(-\csc x \cot x \right) dx $$ which is just $$
-\int_{x_0}^{x_f}\csc^3x dx = \csc x \cot x \Big
|<em x_0>{x_0}^{x_f} + \int</em>^{x_f} \cot^2 x \csc x dx $$
Remembering that $$ \cot^2 x = \csc^2 x -1 ,$$ we have $$
-\int_{x_0}^{x_f}\csc^3x dx = \csc x \cot x \Big
|<em x_0>{x_0}^{x_f} + \int</em>^{x_f} \left(\csc^2 x - 1 \right)
\csc x dx $$ which we can expand to $$ -\int_{x_0}^{x_f}\csc^3x
dx = \csc x \cot x \Big |<em x_0>{x_0}^{x_f} - \int</em>^{x_f}
\csc x dx + \int_{x_0}^{x_f} \csc^3 x dx$$ But this is just what
we want! Rearranging we now have that $$
-2\int_{x_0}^{x_f}\csc^3x dx = \csc x \cot x \Big
|<em x_0>{x_0}^{x_f} - \int</em>^{x_f} \csc x dx$$ Remembering that
the integral for csc is $$ \int \csc x dx =-\ln | \csc x + \cot x|
+ C $$ and evaluating our limits we have that $$
-2\int_{x_0}^{x_f}\csc^3x dx = \csc x_f \cot x_f - \csc x_0
\cot x_0 +\ln \left( \frac{| \csc x_f + \cot x_f|}{| \csc x_0
+ \cot x_0|} \right) $$ Now we just need to evaluate at x_0 = pi/2
and x_f = arcsin u_f. We can draw a right triangle with far angle
x_f, hypoteneuse of length sqrt{u}, and legs of length 1 and sqrt{u-1}
to see that csc x_f = sqrt{u} and cot x_f = sqrt{u-1}, so $$
-2\int_{x_0}^{x_f}\csc^3x dx = \sqrt{u}\sqrt{u-1} + \ln{ |
\sqrt{u} + \sqrt{u-1}|} $$ And this is what we have sought from the
beginning. Using the last two equations on the first page we see that $$
t = k\int_{1}^{u_f} \frac{du}{\left[ \left( 1 - \frac{1}{u}
\right)\right]^{1/2}} = k\left[-2\int_{x_0}^{x_f}\csc^3x dx
\right] = k \left[\sqrt{u}\sqrt{u-1} + \ln{ | \sqrt{u} +
\sqrt{u-1}|} \right] $$ Plugging back in our value of k, we have $$ t
= \left(\frac{m{r_0}^3}{2\alpha}
\right)^{1/2}\left[\sqrt{u}\sqrt{u-1} + \ln{ | \sqrt{u} +
\sqrt{u-1}|} \right] $$ Simplifying a bit and dropping the absolute
value bars since u will always be bigger than u-1, we have our final
answer: $$ t = \left(\frac{m{r_0}^3}{2\alpha}
\right)^{1/2}\left[\sqrt{u(u-1)} + \ln{ \left( \sqrt{u} +
\sqrt{u-1}\right)} \right] $$ where u = r / r_0 is our
non-dimensional distance measurement. And this is (up to some
rearranging) exactly what we get in the initial post.</p>

                    <p>This is the schematic version, if you just wanted hints. The full
solution is given in <a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/05/solar-sails-addendum-i.html">Solar Sails Addendum

Here we present a schematic solution of the differential equation: $$
\frac{dr}{dt} = \left[ \frac{2\alpha}{m} \left( \frac{1}{r_0} -

\int_{0}^{t}dt$$ From here it's nice to non-dimensionalize, so our
integration variable is just a number (with no units attached). This
allows us to get the integral into a form like $$ k\int_{1}^{u_f}
\frac{du}{\left[ \left( 1 - \frac{1}{u} \right)\right]^{1/2}} =
t$$ for appropriate values of k and u. Now we are ready to get started!
Typically, when I see something with a square root in the denominator

an appropriate trig substitution, we get something of the form $$
\int_{1}^{u_f} \frac{du}{\left[ \left( 1 - \frac{1}{u}

\mbox{HINT:} -\int_{x_0}^{x_f} \csc^3x dx =
\int_{x_0}^{x_f}\csc x \left(-\csc^2x \right)dx \right]$$
Remembering that integration by parts goes like $$ \int u dv = uv -
\int v du $$ we can pick appropriate values of u and v to get something
nice, which eventually leads to $$ -\int_{x_0}^{x_f}\csc^3x dx =
\csc x \cot x \Big |<em x_0>{x_0}^{x_f} - \int</em>^{x_f} \csc x
dx + \int_{x_0}^{x_f} \csc^3 x dx$$ But this is just what we

dx = \csc x \cot x \Big |<em x_0>{x_0}^{x_f} - \int</em>^{x_f}
\csc x dx$$ Evaluating our integrals, we see that $$
-2\int_{x_0}^{x_f}\csc^3x dx = \sqrt{u}\sqrt{u-1} + \ln{ |
\sqrt{u} + \sqrt{u-1}|} $$ And this is what we have sought from the
beginning. Plugging back in to our earlier equations and rearranging
gives $$ t = \left(\frac{m{r_0}^3}{2\alpha}
\right)^{1/2}\left[\sqrt{u(u-1)} + \ln{\left( \sqrt{u} +

            </header><div class="e-content entry-content">
                    <p>Hi everyone. As this is my first post, I thought I'd introduce myself.
Like the rest of the Virtuosi, I'm a graduate student in physics at
Cornell University. I work in experimental particle physics, in
particular on the Compact Muon Solenoid, one of the detectors at the
Large Hadron Collider. I'll post more on what I actually do at some
point in the future, but I thought I'd start with a post in the spirit
of some of the other fun calculations that we've done. My goal is to
convince you that black holes created by the LHC cannot possibly destroy
the world.
To start with, the main reason no one working on the LHC is too
concerned about black holes is because of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation">Hawking
radiation</a>. While we
usually think of black holes as objects that nothing can escape from,
Stephen Hawking predicted that black holes actually do emit some light,
losing energy (and mass) in the process. In the case of the little bitty
black holes that the LHC could produce, they should just evaporate in a
shower of Hawking radiation.
That's great you say, but Hawking radiation has never actually been
observed. What if Hawking is wrong and the black holes won't evaporate?
Well, the usual next argument is that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray">cosmic
rays</a> from space bombard the
earth all the time, producing collisions many times more energetic than
what we'll be able to produce at the LHC. To me, this is a fairly
convincing argument. However, let's pretend we don't know about these
cosmic rays and that there's no Hawking radiation. We can calculate what
effect black holes produced by the LHC would have on the earth if they
do stick around.
To start out with, the most massive black hole the LHC could produce
would be around 10 Tera-electron-volts, or TeV. We're probably
overestimating here. The eventual goal is for the LHC collisions to be
14 TeV, but producing a particle with the entire collision energy is
incredibly unlikely (see <a href="http://www.scientificblogging.com/quantum_diaries_survivor/fascinating_new_higgs_boson_search_dzero_experiment">Tomasso Dorigo's
post</a>
for more details on why, along with more details than you probably
wanted to know about hadron colliders). However, we want to think about
the worst case scenario here, and we're just going to do an order of
magnitude calculation, so 10 TeV is a good number. Note that I'm using a
particle physics convention here of giving masses in terms of energies
using E=mc^2. For reference, 10 TeV is about 1000 times smaller than a
small virus.
Now from the mass of our black hole, we can get its size by calculating
something called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius">Schwarzschild
radius</a>. The
Schwarzchild radius for a black hole of mass m is given by
$$r = \frac{2Gm}{c^2}\text{.}$$
Here G is Newton's gravitational constant and c is the speed of light.
Plugging our mass in gives us
$$r = 10^{-50} \text{meters.}$$
This is incredibly small! In fact as I was writing this, I realized that
it's actually smaller than the Planck length, which means our equation
for the Schwarzschild radius may be somewhat suspect. Nonetheless, let's
hope that if we ever figure out quantum gravity, it gives us a
correction of order one and proceed with our calculation, which is just
an order-of-magnitude affair anyway.
Now, anything that enters the Schwarzschild radius of the black hole is
absorbed by it. The lightest thing that we could imagine the black hole
swallowing is an electron. Let's figure out how long on average a black
hole would have to travel through material with the density of the earth
before it absorbs an electron. In the spirit of considering the worst
case scenario, we'll have the black hole travel at the speed of light,
and consider the earth to be the density of lead.
We could do a complicated cross-section calculation to find the rate at
which the black hole accumulates mass, but we can also get it right up
to factors of pi through unit analysis. We know that the answer should
involve the area of the black hole, the density of the earth, and the
speed of the black hole. We want our answer to have units of mass per
time to represent the mass accumulation rate of the black hole. The only
combination that gives the right units is
$$a=\frac{\text{mass}}{\text{time}} = \rho c
r^2=\frac{10,000\text{kg}}{\text{m}^3}\frac{3\times 10^8
\text{m}}{\text{s}}(10^{-50}\text{m})^2} =
10^{-88}\text{kg/s}\text{.}$$
Alright, now that we know how fast our black hole accumulates mass,
let's figure out how long it takes it to accumulate an electron. The
electron mass is
$$m_e = 10^{-30}\text{kg,}$$
so the time to accumulate an electron is
$$t = \frac{m_e}{a} = 10^{50}\text{s.}$$
Now, the current age of the universe is 10^17 seconds. The time it
takes our black hole to accumulate an electron is longer than the age of
the universe by many orders of magnitude! So, if the LHC produces black
holes, and if Hawking is wrong, the black holes will just fly straight
through the earth without interacting with anything. Even if we take the
size of the black hole to be the Planck length, our black hole
accumulates an electron in 10^25 seconds, which is still much longer
than the age of the universe.
So the moral of the story is that you should be excited about the new
discoveries that the LHC might produce, and you don't need to worry
about black holes.</p>

            </header><div class="e-content entry-content">
                    <p>Yesterday I considered how long it would take a human to <a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/05/freezing-in-space-i-blackest-night.html">freeze in
space</a>.
However, I considered only what would happen if you were not absorbing
any radiation from nearby sources. Today we consider what happens if you
do have hot objects nearby. Namely, the sun. The sun provides a lot of
energy, even as far away from it as we are. It keeps the earth at a
comfortable \~20 C, good for us humans, and provides the energy for life
on earth, also good for us humans. That's a lot of energy. So maybe the
sun can keep you alive when you're adrift in space. Or at least keep you
warm. I still think you'll asphyxiate. From here on out we're going to
assume that we are adrift in space near earth. You were out for a
joyride in that new spaceship of yours and something went horribly
wrong. We could go through a whole song and dance of calculating how
much power the sun delivers to the earth, but we won't (if you're
interested, let me know, an I can do that later). Instead, we'll quote
the known result, that the sun delivers \~1370W/m^2 in the vicinity of
the earth. To find out what temperature we would cool to we set the
power we absorb from the sun equal to the power we radiate
$$P_{sun}=P_{rad}$$
$$1370W/m^2<em>A_{ab}</em>e_{ab}=e_{rad}<em>A_{rad}</em>\sigma<em>T^4$$ Where
A_ab is the surface area absorbing the suns power, e_ab is a factor
between 0 and 1 that indicates how much of the incident power we
actually absorb, and e_rad is the emissivity of us, while A_rad is our
radiating area. Note that the emitting and absorbing areas are not the
same! Take a simple example. If you put a sheet in space, and face the
flat side towards the sun, it will only absorb energy from the sun on
one side, but it will radiate energy from both sides. Likewise e_ab and
e_rad are not necessarily equal because we are radiating and absorbing
at different wavelengths. We can solve the above equation for T, giving
$$T=\left(\frac{A_{ab}}{A_{rad}}\right)^{1/4}\left(\frac{e_{ab}}{e_{rad}}\right)^{1/4}\left(\frac{1370W/m^2}{\sigma}\right)^{1/4}$$
For a first pass, we'll make the simplifying assumption that
e_ab=e_rad. Given this,
$$T=394K</em>\left(\frac{A_{ab}}{A_{rad}}\right)^{1/4}$$ Now, the
absorption area of an object is just the shape of the object flattened
into the plane the incident radiation is perpendicular to. That is, the
absorption area of a sphere is a circle (a sphere projected to 2D is
always a circle), while the absorption area of a cylinder could be a
sheet or a circle, or something stranger. The best area ratio we can
ever have is that of a flat sheet, which gives 1/2. For a sphere, like
the earth, the ratio is 1/4. As an aside, this gives an equilibrium
temperature of the earth as \~5C, which is too cold. It turns out that
we shouldn't neglect either the emissivity ratio or the natural
greenhouse effect in the case of the earth. Now, we need to figure out
the area ratio for us. In a <a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/05/human-radiation.html">previous
post</a> I
modeled myself as a cylinder with height 1.8 m and radius .14 m. Let us
assume we are facing the sun dead on, beating down on our chests. This
gives the cross sectional area of a sheet with width 2<em>.14 m =.28 m and
height 1.8 m. This is an area of .5 m^2, while my total surface area is
1.7 m^2. This gives an area ratio of \~.3, or an equilibrium
temperature of $$T=394K</em>(.3)^{1/4}\approx292K$$ That is an
equilibrium temperature of 19 C. Not too cold, but certainly not body
temperature! So the sun will not save us. We also have to factor in the
fact that we reflect better in the visual that we do in the infrared, so
the emissivity ratio we set to 1 probably is less than that, reducing
our equilibrium temperature even more. It is interesting to note,
though, that if we model a human as a two sided sheet instead of a
cylinder, we can bring our equilibrium temperature up to 331 K. That's
\~58 C! So in our model our geometrical assumptions change whether or
not we freeze or die of heat stroke. Finally, since it looks like the
sun may not save us, lets see how much it might slow down our
temperature loss. Instead of a net loss of 860W at body temperature, as
we calculated yesterday, sticking with our cylindrical human we'll have
a net loss of $$860W-1370W/m^2(.5m^2)=175W$$ Similarly at our lowered
body temperature of \~30 C, we'll be losing a net of \~105 W. Once again
taking a geometric average gives an average power loss of \~135 W. Using
the energy to cool we found yesterday it would take 16300 s, or 4.5
hours to freeze! Also note that if you're getting too hot or cold, given
how much the geometry plays into things, by changing your orientation to
the sun you'll be able to have a certain amount of control over how much
you heat up or cool down. Also, make sure you rotate yourself so that
you end up evenly heated, and not roasted on one side and frozen on the
other!</p>

                    <p>In the last post I made, I discussed the fact that <a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/05/human-radiation.html">humans radiate
energy</a>.
In that post I calculated that we actually radiate quite a lot of power.
This immediately raises a few questions, the most obvious one being: How
long would it take you to freeze in space? This question is
multifaceted, and I'm going to split it between two parts. This first
part, 'Blackest Night' is how quickly we'd freeze if we were completely
lost in space, nothing anywhere near. The second part, 'Turn On The
Sun!' will address what would happen in near earth orbit. We need to
clarify what we mean when we say freezing in space. The fatal
temperature change for a human is (according to the all knowing
internet), roughly a drop of 7C. If you remember my previous post, we
calculated that we would radiate about 860 W. Now, we have to ask how
much energy it takes to change our temperature by 7 C. Well, as I've
discussed a
<a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/04/beer-diet.html#more">few</a>
<a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/04/falling-water-hot-or-cold.html">times</a>,
the energy it takes to change the temperature is given by $$Q=mc\Delta
T$$ The mass of a human is \~75 kg. We're mostly water, so let's just
assume that we are all water. This gives us a specific heat of 4.2
kJ/kg<em>K. The energy needed for our 7 C temperature change is then
$$Q=(75kg)(4.2kJ/kg</em>K)(7K)=2.2 MJ$$ By the time we have dropped to 30
C, we are only radiating a power of $$P=eA\sigma
T^4\=(.97)(1.7m^2)(5.67\cdot10^{-8}W/m^2K^4)(303K)^4=790W$$ Let
us assume that the average power radiated is the geometric average of
these two powers, $$P_{avg}=\sqrt{(860W)(790W)}\approx825W$$ This
gives us a time to freeze of $$t=\frac{2.2MJ}{825W}\approx2700s$$ This
is \~45 minutes. So you've got 45 minutes until a deadly freeze in deep
space. Seems a rather long time, does it not? I'm fairly certain that
you'd freeze much faster in antarctica than deep space. Why? Because in
Antarctica you have more cooling mechanisms that just radiation, you
have conduction in the air around you and convection of that warmer air
away from your skin. If you're adrift in space, for all that it is
rather cold, the good news is that you'll asphyxiate before you freeze!
All of this was done assuming that there's no energy gain from anywhere.
That is, that we're stuck somewhere in the deepest space, the blackest
night. Tomorrow we'll consider what would happen if you were in near
earth orbit, with all of these lovely energy sources around,
particularly the sun.</p>

                    <p>Things are still busy here at the Virutosi. Hopefully in a week or so
we'll be back to normal, and much more active than we've been recently
Anyways, today I'd like to consider human radiation. It is well known
that any object will radiate energy based on its temperature. Even more
interesting, we radiate at all wavelengths, though at the human body
temperature our radiation is sharply peaked in the infrared. Even so, we
still put out some x-ray radiation. As a professor of mine once said,
consider that next time you sleep with someone! Given all this, the
question on my mind today is: how does the energy we radiate daily
compare to the energy we consume? That is, why don't I lose weight
sitting here typing on the computer? We physicists call perfect
radiators black bodies (something that radiates perfectly also must
absorb perfectly). For perfect radiators, the power radiated is given by
$$P=\sigma A T^4$$ where sigma is the stephan-boltzman constant, A is
the surface area of the radiator, and T is the temperature of the
radiator. For objects that are not perfect emitters or perfect
absorbers, we through in a fudge factor, e the emissivity, which is
between 0 and 1. This makes the power emitted $$P=e \sigma A T^4$$ To
figure out the power radiated by a human, we need to know three things.
The first is the emissivity of human skin. It turns out this is .97. The
second is the temperature of a human body, \~37 C. The third is the
surface area of a human. This requires a little estimation. I'm about
180 cm tall, and I wear 35" waist pants, so my radius is \~14 cm.
Modeling myself as a cylinder, I have a surface area of \~1.7 m^2. Now
we can estimate my power output: $$P=.97<em>5.67\cdot 10^{-8}W/m^2K^4
</em> 1.7 m^2 * (310K)^4$$ $$P \approx 860W$$ I'm powerful! That's
about 14 (60W) lightbulbs! We'd like to compare that to our daily energy
intake, so we need to turn this power into an energy. Well, there are
86400 s in a day. So we radiate 74<em>10^6 J per day. If you read my
<a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/04/beer-diet.html">beer diet</a>
post, you'll know the conversion between J and Calories (note the
capitol C). If not, suffice it to say that 1 Calorie = 4.2</em>10^3 J. If
I consume about 2000 Calories a day (typical, right?), then I take in
about 8.4<em>10^6 J per day. So, dear reader, why haven't I lost weight
while typing this post? There are a few answers. I'm wearing insulating
layers, clothing which keeps in some of my radiated heat. Also, our skin
temperature is lower than our internal temperature of 37 C. But more
than that, I'm absorbing energy from the surroundings. The earth is a
fairly good blackbody radiator, with an average temperature of \~20 C.
This means that my net power loss, with no clothing, would be about
$$\Delta P \approx (5.67\cdot 10^{-8}
W/m^2K^4)(1.7m^2)((310K)^4-(293K)^4)$$ $$\Delta P = 180W$$ This is
\~15</em>10^6 J per day. While still more than my intake, this is much
closer, and you can imagine that the rest of the difference can be made
up by our lower skin temperature, and clothing and such instruments of
men. Of course, these numbers are rough, so I don't recommend the 'naked
diet', where you try to lose weight by walking around naked. Or if you
do try it, don't say I told you to when you're taken in for indecent
exposure!</p>

                    <p>In a <a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/05/letting-air-out-of-tires.html">recent
post</a>
I calculated how cold air coming out of bike tires should feel. However,
at the end of the post, I did note that there are competing explanations
for why the air cools. There's the approach I took, which is adiabatic
cooling, but there's also something called the Joule-Thomson effect. The
Joule-Thomson effect has the interesting property that helium being let
out of a bike tire would actually be warmer, which suggests an immediate
way to test which effect is dominant. We pressurize a bike tire with
helium, and see if the valve gets cold or hot. This is exactly what I
did. With the help of Mark and Vince, our local equipment gurus, I was
able to pressurize a bike tire to 26 psi with helium. Using one of those
little thermal measurers you can buy at radio shack, we measured the
initial temperature of the valve as 80 F. We then released the helium,
and measured the temperature of the valve as 73 F. The adiabatic
approach is the winner! Our experiment confirms that the dominant effect
of the cooling is the adiabatic cooling I talked about yesterday. The
Joule-Thomson effect may be at play, but if so it takes a secondary role
to the adiabatic cooling. Now, some of you may be saying: wait a second,
you predicted the air would be -100 F! It doesn't feel that cold! Nor
did your valve cool down to -100 F! To which I reply: Yes, I did predict
very cold air. But you have to remember that it is mixing with a lot of
room temperature air, so it won't feel as cold as I predicted. Nor will
it transfer much heat to the valve (recall, we predicted this would be
an adiabatic process, with absolutely no heat transfer, something that
is obviously false). Also, I didn't have 60 psi of pressure. If we do
the calculation, 26 psi only gives a temperature of 250K = - 10 F.
Hopefully that answers your question. And now, dear reader, as I've
wanted to say for a while: Myth Busted!</p>
