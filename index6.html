                <div class="summary">In the last post I made, I discussed the fact that humans radiate energy. In that post I calculated that we actually radiate quite a lot of power. This immediately raises a few questions, the most obvious one being: How long would it take you to freeze in space? This question is multifaceted, and I'm going to split it between two parts. This first part, 'Blackest Night' is how quickly we'd freeze if we were completely lost in space, nothing anywhere near. The second part, 'Turn On The Sun!' will address what would happen in near earth orbit. We need to clarify what we mean when we say freezing in space. The fatal temperature change for a human is (according to the all knowing internet), roughly a drop of 7C. If you remember my previous post, we calculated that we would radiate about 860 W. Now, we have ...

Hopefully in a week or so we'll be back to normal, and much more active than we've been recently Anyways, today I'd like to consider human radiation. It is well known that any object will radiate energy based on its temperature. Even more interesting, we radiate at all wavelengths, though at the human body temperature our radiation is sharply peaked in the infrared. Even so, we still put out some x-ray radiation. As a professor of mine once said, consider that next time you sleep with someone! Given all this, the question on my mind today is: how does the energy we radiate daily compare to the energy we consume? That is, why don't I lose weight sitting here typing on the computer? We physicists call perfect radiators black bodies (something that radiates perfectly also must absorb perfectly ...

                <div class="summary">In a recent post I calculated how cold air coming out of bike tires should feel. However, at the end of the post, I did note that there are competing explanations for why the air cools. There's the approach I took, which is adiabatic cooling, but there's also something called the Joule-Thomson effect. The Joule-Thomson effect has the interesting property that helium being let out of a bike tire would actually be warmer, which suggests an immediate way to test which effect is dominant. We pressurize a bike tire with helium, and see if the valve gets cold or hot. This is exactly what I did. With the help of Mark and Vince, our local equipment gurus, I was able to pressurize a bike tire to 26 psi with helium. Using one of those little thermal measurers you can buy at radio shack, we measured the initial temperature ...

                <div class="summary">There's a nice post over at Physics Buzz that I thought I might draw your attention to. The central quote for me is: "Speaking strictly about technology - which is often the knowledge attained by physicists put into practical use by engineers - physics has created some pretty amazing things. Cars, planes, iphones, medical treatments, lasers, 3-D movies, and the Large Hadron Collider. We are constantly WOWED by science. Unfortunately, the less someone understands how these things work, the more they begin to believe anything is possible. In other words, if you don't understand the parameters that allow for amazing things (like jets!) you also don't understand the parameters that would prevent other things (like energy generating heart replacements). If you don't understand anything about physics and technology, then it appears to be nothing short of magic, and magic has no bounds..." I think this gets at some ...

                <div class="summary">Have you ever noticed how when you let air out of a bike tire (or, I suppose, a car tire) it feels rather cold? Today we're going to explore why that is, and just how cold it is. Many people consider the air escaping from a tire as a classic example of an adiabatic process. What is an adiabatic process? It is a process that happens so quickly there is no time for heat flow to occur. For our air in the bike tire this means we're letting it out of the tire so quickly that no energy can move into it from the surrounding air. This may not be exactly true, there may be a little energy flow, but there is little enough that we can ignore it. Given that, how do we talk about temperature change? Let's give a physical motivation first. Imagine a gas ...

                <div class="summary">I know it's been pretty quiet over here this week. The semester is winding down (a week of classes left), and that means that things have been kicked up into another gear. We've got four or five ideas bouncing around at the moment, so hopefully we'll get some up soon. Today I'd like to talk about the beer diet. A while back, there was a rumor going around that if you drank ice cold beer your body would burn more calories heating the beer than the beer contained. It turns out that this false, and I think the claim relied on a lack of knowledge that the American food Calorie is actually one thousand calories (note the difference in capitalization). Let's prove this to ourselves. Let us consider 12 fluid oz of beer. To any good approximation we can treat this as 12 oz of ...

I say this because they can be convenient when needed, but there's nothing more annoying than a dropped call or an inconveniently timed ring tone. Since many people carry their phones with them daily, there has been a number of studies which ask what are the long-term health effects of cell phone usage. While the controversy rages among medical researchers, I decided to find my own answers by doing a calculation based on the power output of a simple hand set. The key physical idea in this calculation is Faraday's law. You can check Wikipedia for a lengthy article describing it, but I'm more interested in getting down to business. Now, from the antenna of every cell phone, an electromagnetic wave is emitted. This EM wave, has magnetic and electric components which oscillate back and ...

Make the set shorter or longer for convidence and try to understand the tradeoffs by trying to do problems with your choice. This is the way I would do it because I have that kind of personality! It's the way I study -- to understand somethingby trying to work it out or, in other words, to understand something by creating it.

Of all the doomsday predictions out there (nuclear holocaust for the cynics, death by snoo-snoo for the optimists) it is the only one that is just about certain to occur at some point in the geological near future. On top of that, it's one that we could potentially avoid with enough time and some neat ideas . Let's model an asteroid impact on the earth. We will assume an asteroid starting from rest at infinity and falling to the surface of the earth due to earth's gravity only. Now obviously these assumptions are not exactly correct. We can imagine our asteroid not starting from rest or feeling some force due to the sun. Each of these would certainly change our answer, but ...

                <div class="summary">In honor of Earth day, I thought I would take a look at what it would mean to do physics in 'Earth' units. What do I mean by that? Well lets be anti-Copernican here, in fact lets assume the opposite of the Copernican principle, and state that the Earth is privileged in the universe and define all of our units around the Earth. So, I will put a little subscript earth on all of the 'earth' units. They are to be read as 'earth meters' or 'earth amps', etc. We will take as our starting point the mass, radius and day of the earth, normalizing all of our standards to that. This gives us our initial conversion factors $$ 1 g_{\oplus} = M_{\oplus} = 5.9742 \times 10^{34} \text{ kg} $$ $$ 1 m_{\oplus} = R_{\oplus} = 6378.1 \text{ km} $$ $$ 1 s_{\oplus} = T_{\oplus} = 86,400 \text{ s} $$ From this ...

We here at The Virtuosi decided, what better way to celebrate the earth than to figure out how to destroy it? So that is exactly what we intend to do. This post will focus on the destruction of the earth by a laser beam. This is a familiar concept. Whether it is Marvin the Martian or the Death Star, destroying planets with lasers (or threatening to) is a common theme. We will be considering two questions today. The first is fairly obvious: how much power would the death star need to destroy the earth? The second relates to a topic of continuing interest of mine: how much would the death star recoil upon firing? First, the power we would need. Most estimates of the death star's ...

                <div class="summary">Lasers seem to be on my mind recently. Just yesterday, the class I TA for (E&M for engineers) talked about the momentum carried by E&M waves. This called to mind a discussion I had with a housemate a few weeks back. He had heard somewhere that 'they' were thinking of launching satellites with lasers. No way, I thought to myself. Satellites are too heavy. However, his question has been hovering around in my mind, so I've decided to try and answer it: can we use a laser to launch a satellite into orbit? Let us begin with a few simplifying assumptions. I'm going to assume that we want our launched satellite to reach the escape velocity of the earth. Of course, we don't want a satellite to escape orbit, but escape velocity is calculated without considering any kind of drag forces on our launched object ...

                <div class="summary">Matt Springer over at Built on Facts has a very nice post following up on my earlier analysis of whether or not a laser gun would recoil. In my analysis I came to the conclusion that the momentum delivered was much less than that of a conventional gun, but that the impulse, and hence the force delivered, was about the same. However, that force was delivered over a ~30ns timescale, which left open the question of whether or not the wielder would be able to feel that recoil. While I had thought to possibly return to this issue at some point, Matt has beat me to it. This is fortuitous, because I wasn't sure quite where to start with the question, while he approaches it in a very sensible, clear manner. The gist of his post is that he compares our response to short time scale forces to ...

Its a great way to never lose your keys. But one thing I always notice is that when I hook it on, it swings, and every time it swings it makes a click. This you might expect. What always surprises me is how long the keys keep swinging. They seem to swing for a surprisingly long time, minutes. It always catches me off guard. In order to explain why, I get to talk about Q Factors The Q factor stands for quality factor. Its a nondimensional parameter (my favorite kind) that tells you how pure your oscillator is.

Being mostly interested in condensed matter, I am by no means an expert in cosmology (I’ll leave that to Corky). However, I will not abandon the request, but instead, spin it in a more condensed matter direction, by talking about Entropy. Entropy is a quantity that measures disorder. The more ordered your system is, i.e. the less ways you can arrange the constituents of your system, the less entropy you have and vice versa. I like to use the example of how messy my room is to visualize this. When I clean my room, I would pick up the random articles of clothing, books, etc and put them in the places where they belong ...

His solution has proved crucial in furthering statistical mechanics, allowing theorists to check all of there approximation schemes against analytical results. I call his effort a tour de force because it was a huge mathematical exercise, his solution spanning 33 pages. I also call it a 'tour de force' because I have seen it referenced as such in no less than 5 different sources, as well as numerous times in speech. This got me wondering, just how many times is Onsager's solution called a tour de force... So, first I started with a Google books search, and turned up 39 Books, among the one's that Google has indexed, which surely represent only the tip of the iceburg. The books search turns up some of the more popular statistical mechanics books including ...

I don't think I'll give too much away if I tell you that the basic premise of the movie is that the earth's core has stopped rotating, and so the earth's magnetic field is collapsing, which they claim will mean that all of the previously deflected microwaves (note: EM radiation is not bent by a magnetic field) will cook us all.

                <div class="summary">This photo has been making the rounds on the internet lately: Originally from here. Its a time lapse photo of the sun taken from a pinhole camera from June until December. The real question is: Where was this photo taken? Wandering SunWell, first lets think a second about why the sun would wander in the sky. As you may already know, the earth's pole is not aligned with our solar system's axis. The earth's axis has what is called a 23.5 degree axial tilt, or obliquity. As a result, if you sit at a fixed latitude on the earth, then as the earth revolves around the sun and the year goes by, the angle the sun makes with the horizon changes. We need to estimate how much the sun's angle in the sky changes. Consider the following diagram You'll notice that the angle ...

                <div class="summary">There were some undergrads in my office for office hours the other day, asking questions for the midterm. I'm teaching the engineering course on optics and waves (also known as Things that go Sine) and the students were looking at a problem dealing with quarter-wave plates. A quarter-wave plate, the question goes, is a kind of optical instrument that turns light with linear polarization into circular polarization. Show, it continues, that it also turns light with circular polarization linear. After a minute or two of discussing how a quarter-wave plate work ("what, does it act differently on different axes?" giggled one, and everybody gasped when I said yes) we went to the math. I wrote down the equations for light with linear and circular polarization, $$ E_0 \hat{x} \cos\left(kz-\omega t\right) \to \frac{E_0}{\sqrt{2}}\hat{x}\cos\left(kz-\omega t\right) + \frac{E_0 ...

                <div class="summary">Ever wonder why don't you see a standard rainbow when looking at a thin film such as soap stretched across a membrane ready for bubble making? Well, I encountered this problem when I presented my intro physics section with a quiz question today. Properly stated, the question was... "Suppose white light is incident on a thin film (a soap bubble of n=1.33) hanging vertically inside of a square loop. The minimum thickness of the film at the top of the loop is 900nm and it increases linearly (due to gravity) to 1300nm by the bottom of the loop which is 10cm away. This means that the thickness as a function of distance from the top of the loop is $$ d(x) = \text{900nm} + \text{400nm} * \left( \frac{x}{\text{10cm}} \right) $$ What wavelengths will be most strongly reflected as a function of distance along our bubble film ...

                <div class="summary">The other day I was on my way through ye olde internets to the Quantum Leap episode index at Wikipedia, but stumbled over a quote by Feynman by accident: "There are 10^11 stars in the galaxy. That used to be a huge number. But it's only a hundred billion. It's less than the national deficit! We used to call them astronomical numbers. Now we should call them economical numbers" So this got me thinking. What if we decided to pay the national debt...in pennies? Seems fair enough, we don't really want to pay it and when you don't want to pay something but you have to you pay it in pennies. Hooray! Last I heard this figure was somewhere around $10,000,000,000,000 (ten trillion), that is:</div><div> </div><div>$$ \text{Debt} = 10^{13} \text{dollars} = 10^{15} \text{pennies} $$</div ...

It is an expression, through the majesty of song (rap), of our love for all things quantum and undead ( or perhaps a superposition of dead/ not dead states...? ). We all know that the great physicist Paul Dirac, was not a vampire. What this rap presupposes is... maybe he was? If so, he would almost certainly be named Diracula. He would be especially good at physics. But he would especially be totally rad at rapping. Without further ado, the Diracula Rapula: Yo, its Diracula and I got something to say Better listen close cause sometimes my teeth get in the way.
