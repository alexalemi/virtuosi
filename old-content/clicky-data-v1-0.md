Let us not forget the many hours in which untold numbers of anonymous internet users tried in vain to spell simple words using only discrete steps on a finite lattice.  Let us not forget the Great Server Crash that caused the physics department to be charged extra for data usage.  Let us not forget Clicky v1.0.<div><br /></div><div>So today we remember him, our beloved Clicky v1.0, by releasing his data as well.  It can be found close to the other Clicky data dump from yesterday at this location:</div><div><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.mattbierbaum.com/clicky/clickydat2.tar.bz2"><span class="Apple-style-span">Download Clicky v1.0</span></a></div><div><div><br /></div><div>Be warned, this was actually available to the anonymous internet and there are a few things that may surprise you.  That being said, the last half of this data set is actually comprised of multiple users interacting with Clicky at once so it should have different statistics than yesterday's data, though we have yet to sort through that too.  More of our analysis is to follow..</div></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Also, props to whoever made the dinosaur.</div>
