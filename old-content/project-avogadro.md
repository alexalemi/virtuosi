We have a new summer project.  The goal is to create an N-body simulation of a pendulum on a string in a box containing a gas.  The idea is to model the system as a collection of particles, hopefully in the thousands.  I think it would be an interesting challenge, and one that is within our reach.  Many of us have programming experience, some with parallel computing experience.<br /><br />My initial thoughts on the problem:  We have three kinds of particles, stringons, woodons and gasons.  These three different kinds of particles would then we used to model the material properties of the string, a wood ball attached and the gas in the chamber.  We would have to simulate gravity, close range repulsion, elastic attraction, collisions, pressure, things like that.  <br /><br />I'm hoping we would be able to learn a bunch about N-body simulations, solve some interesting problems, and hopefully arrive at something we could run.  Imagine running the pendulum down, the air friction will slow the pendulum to a stop, but we should be able to see the rise in temperature of the ball and string.  Imagine running it forward for a bit, then reversing it, having the right collection of initial conditions spin the pendulum up again.  Imagine if we get this to work, we could easily simulate coupled pendulums or other systems, perhaps liquids next.
