Rev. B article).<br /><br />I classify a third type of question, one that is more process based: "How can we do X?". &nbsp;This third category is where the question that motivates (at least in the broad sense) the experiment I'm going to describe comes from. &nbsp;I can phrase it as: "How can we successfully cryopreserve biological samples?" &nbsp;For those unfamiliar with biological cryopreservation, this is something I discussed <a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/05/cryopreservation.html">almost a year ago</a>. &nbsp;From there, we get into smaller questions, most of those are type two, based on physical observations.<br /><br />This particular small experiment has grown out of my work on cryopreservation, and has more to do with the structure of water on freezing. &nbsp;Over the past year, one of the projects I've been working on has been to measure the so called critical warming rate of aqueous solutions. &nbsp;This is the rate at which you have to warm vitreous aqueous solutions (see my earlier cryopreservation post for more details) to prevent ice formation on warming. &nbsp;The question that has grown out of this work is: how does the cooling history of my vitreous sample affect the critical warming rate?<br /><br />Having arrived at the question, we'll next discuss the apparatus.
