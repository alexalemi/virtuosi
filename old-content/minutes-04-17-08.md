We had our second meeting.  Nobody had really done a whole lot since our meeting on Thursday.<br /><br />We decided to commit a bit to the delayed quantum eraser experiment.  For next week, everyone should at a minimum read the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_choice_quantum_eraser">Wikipedia page</a> and one of the corresponding experiment papers, the Yoon-Hu Kim one: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9903047">arXiv link</a> or the Marlan Scully one:  <a href="http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRA/v25/i4/p2208_1">Phys. Rev. A</a> (available on the Caltech network).  <br /><br />Next week we will discuss what the implications of the experiment are, and start to discuss whether we could perform the experiment ourselves, and whether this could be useful for observation (what happens if you point it into the sky).<br /><br />As another side note, Max brought up a problem he had been thinking about.  When you are playing the guitar, you can hammer down or pull off.  When he pull's off, he noticed that the volume noticeably decreases.  We looked at whether this is an effect owing to the extension of the vibrating string or some other effect.  Assuming that most of the sound and excitation of a guitar string is in the primary mode, we can calculate the amplitude of the primary mode upon instantaneous string extension, after the simple integral. <br /><br /><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/R7kd_uBqlxI/AAAAAAAAACA/XU9e-RHTSeo/s320/Picture+2.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5168195027908335378" /><br /><br />We can obtain the amplitude of the primary mode upon extension.  Since volume goes like amplitude squared we obtain a graph in dL in units of L:<br /><br /><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/R7kfeuBqlyI/AAAAAAAAACI/LCwZFRn-QO8/s320/plot.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5168196659995907874" /><br /><br />The plot seems to indicate that for dLs at about a tenth we should expect an amplitude of 96% or so.  In Max's experience the volume drops more, which we conclude is probably the result of him being slow about the pull off, dampening the string in the process.<br /><br />So, see you all next week, and read up on the delayed quantum eraser.
