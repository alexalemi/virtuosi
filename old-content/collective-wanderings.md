<i>Update [04/04/11]: &nbsp;It seems Clicky got too popular for our bandwidth limits on the physics servers. &nbsp;Hopefully we'll be able to fix this sometime soon...</i><br /><i><br /></i><br /><i>Update [04/02/11]: &nbsp;We made the code faster, so check out the new and improved Clicky!</i><br /><br />Hey, kids!&nbsp; Would you like to be a bit player in a grand experiment with poorly thought out objectives?&nbsp; If so, then check <a href="http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~aalemi/clicky/">this</a> out.&nbsp; It's a little interactive "game" [1] that Alemi and Matt coded up.<br /><br />When you click on the link, you will be redirected to a page showing something like this:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FYqCFtPrbT0/TZaZF4ubmPI/AAAAAAAAAMM/5Hf-_v0wTrY/s1600/clicky1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FYqCFtPrbT0/TZaZF4ubmPI/AAAAAAAAAMM/5Hf-_v0wTrY/s400/clicky1.png" width="335" /></a></div><br /><a name='more'></a><br />Using the arrow keys on your keyboard or by clicking on the arrow buttons on the screen, you can move the dot around.&nbsp; Sound fun yet?&nbsp; Well, the interesting bit comes in with the fact that anyone who wants to can move the same dot at the same time.&nbsp; The plot will update automatically, so if you're really bored you can sit around and watch someone else move the dot around.&nbsp; Heck, you could even give the dot a cute name like Mr. Dottington and tell it how your day was.&nbsp; We won't judge you.&nbsp; [2]<br /><br />Anyway, check it out if you've got a bit of time to kill.&nbsp; Explore the space and we'll get back to you with the "results" of this "experiment" sometime in the "future." &nbsp; <br /><br /><br />[1]&nbsp; There are no objectives and "winning" is undefined (for a contrary argument, however, see Sheen et. al (2011))<br /><br />[2]&nbsp; But Mr. Dottington will.
