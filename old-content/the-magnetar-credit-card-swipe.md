&nbsp;Today I'd like to talk about the Magnetar Credit Card Swipe. &nbsp;Sounds like some sinister short on a derivatives deal, doesn't it? &nbsp;Well, no need to worry, we don't deal with scary things like that here. &nbsp;Instead, we are going to talk about a super-magnetized neutron star speeding past Earth. <br /><br />A while ago I heard that a magnetar can erase all the world's credit cards from half the distance to the moon. &nbsp;I did a little research and it seems like this is the go-to "fun fact" about magnetars. &nbsp;Almost every time they are brought up in a popular science article, their credit card-erasing prowess is sure to get a mention. &nbsp;So let's check it out!<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br />First things first, though. &nbsp;What the heck is a magnetar [1]? &nbsp;Well, "magnetar" is just a spiffy name for a particular flavor of neutron star. &nbsp;Now, neutron stars are already pretty extreme objects. &nbsp;They've got a little more than the mass of the sun squished down to the size of a big city with a central density over 10 trillion times greater than lead. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TUXMdXcrmoI/AAAAAAAAAJI/K2MVmanh5g4/s1600/earthmag.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="187" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TUXMdXcrmoI/AAAAAAAAAJI/K2MVmanh5g4/s200/earthmag.png" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Dipolar magnetic field</td></tr></tbody></table>What makes magnetars truly name-worthy (and more extreme than Doritos and Mountain Dew at the X-Games) is the fact that they have strong magnetic fields. &nbsp;And when I say strong, I mean <i>really</i>&nbsp;strong. &nbsp;Taking the magnetic field to be dipolar (like the Earth's, see figure), the field at the poles of a magnetar can be as&nbsp;high as 10^15 gauss [2]. &nbsp;For comparison, the magnetic field of the Earth is about half a gauss and the big magnets used in MRIs are about 10^4 gauss. &nbsp;So we're talking about some big fields!<br /><br />Looking up the specs for a typical credit card, it looks like most take about 1000 gauss to erase. &nbsp;And now we can get started.<br /><br />I always forget the exact form of the magnetic field of a dipole, but Jackson doesn't. &nbsp;He tells me that it is<br /><br />\[ \vec{B}\left(\vec{r}\right) = \frac{3\vec{n}\left(\vec{n}\cdot\vec{m}\right) - \vec{m}}{|\vec{r} |^3}\]<br /><br />where m is the magnetic dipole moment, r is the displacement vector to where we are measuring the field, and n is a unit vector that points to where we are measuring. <br /><br />To find the magnitude (which is what we really care about), we just take the dot product of the vector with itself and take the square root. &nbsp;Working this out we get<br /><br />\[ B\left(\vec{r}\right) = \frac{|\vec{m}|}{r^3}{\left[ 3\cos^2{\theta}+1\right]}^{1/2} \]<br /><br />where theta is the angle between the magnetic moment vector and the direction vector n. &nbsp;But we are just looking for a rough estimate here so let's just set the cosine term to one. &nbsp;Now we have<br /><br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">\[ B\left(r\right) = \frac{2|\vec{m}|}{r^3}\]</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">We can now use the above to our advantage. &nbsp;Since we are assuming we know the polar magnetic field strength, we can rearrange and solve for the magnetic moment. &nbsp;At the pole of a star the distance is just going to be the radius, so for radius R and field strength Bp, we get</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">\[ |\vec{m}|} = \frac{1}{2}B_{p}R^3 \]</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Plugging this back in, we get a nice little formula for the strength of the magnetic field in terms of the stellar radius and the polar field strength</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">\[B(r) = B_{p}{\left(\frac{R}{r}\right)}^3 \]</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div>And we are almost there! &nbsp;Rearranging now for r, we get<br /><br />\[r = R{\left[\frac{B_p}{B(r)}\right]}^{1/3} \]<br /><br />Huzzah! &nbsp;Now we just need to plug in some values. &nbsp;Well, we'll use Bp &nbsp;= 10^15 gauss, B(r) = 1000 gauss (strong enough field to erase credit cards) and R = 10 km, which gives...<br /><br />\[ r \approx 10km \times {\left(\frac{10^{15}gauss}{10^{3}gauss}\right)}^{1/3} \]<br /><br />so<br /><br />\[ r \approx \mbox{100,000 km} \]<br /><br />The moon is about 380,000 km away. &nbsp;So we find that the magnetar will erase all credit cards up to a little over a quarter the distance to the moon. &nbsp;Not bad! &nbsp;However, all this talk of "half" and "quarter" is a bit misleading given that our best guesses here will be order of magnitude.<br /><br />But, overall, we see that a magnetar at roughly the Earth-Moon distance would have a good shot at erasing your credit cards. &nbsp;Fun fact confirmed!<br /><br /></div><div>[1] &nbsp;For a really nice Scientific American article about magnetars, see <a href="http://solomon.as.utexas.edu/~duncan/sciam.pdf">here</a>. &nbsp;For more information than you could probably ever want, see <a href="http://solomon.as.utexas.edu/~duncan/magnetar.html">here</a>. <br /><br /></div><div>[2] &nbsp;For those of you who prefer your magnetic field strengths given in units named after someone played by David Bowie in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prestige_(film)#Cast">movie</a>, you may note the conversion: &nbsp;1 gauss = 10^-4 tesla.</div>
