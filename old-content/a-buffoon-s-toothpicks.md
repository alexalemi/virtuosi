<br /><br />This is how the problem of Buffon's needle was first presented to me. &nbsp;Stated more formally the problem is this: &nbsp;given a needle of length <i>l</i>&nbsp;and a floor of parallel lines separated by a distance <i>d</i>, what is the probability of a randomly dropped needle crossing a line? <br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br />Working this all out (see a derivation <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffon's_needle">here</a>, for example), we find that the probability a needle crosses a line is<br /><br />\[ P = \frac{2l}{d\pi} \]<br /><br />So now we have a nice way of experimentally coming up with a value for pi. &nbsp;Simply by tossing a bunch of needles of length <i>l</i>&nbsp;on a striped surface with lines separated by a distance <i>d</i>&nbsp;and counting the total number of times a needle crosses a line and the total number of throws, we can approximate the probability (and thus, pi). &nbsp;I say "approximate" because it will only be true in the limit of an infinite number of throws. &nbsp;Anyway, we have that<br /><br />\[ \frac{\mbox{Number of crosses}}{\mbox{Number of throws}} \approx P = \frac{2l}{\pi d} \]<br /><br />so, rearranging a bit, we have that<br /><br />\[ \pi \approx \left( \frac{2l}{d} \right) \left(\frac{\mbox{Number of throws}}{\mbox{Number of crosses}} \right) \]<br /><br />Now we have something that we can go about measuring. &nbsp;I am going to define the following value to be the experimental quantity we aim to measure:<br /><br />\[ \tilde{\pi} = \left( \frac{2l}{d} \right) \left(\frac{\mbox{Number of throws}}{\mbox{Number of crosses}} \right) \]<br /><br />So now that we know what we are measuring, let's get to it! &nbsp;Since I'm not allowed to use needles in my home experiments anymore, I decided to use toothpicks. &nbsp;For my striped surface, I just used the wooden floor in our house (see Figure 1). &nbsp;The toothpick length was almost exactly the same as the distance between lines on the floor, so we see that that the <i>l </i>and <i>d</i>&nbsp;terms cancel in our expression above.<br /><br />To make the measurements, I threw ten toothpicks at a time onto the floor and counted how many crossed the lines. &nbsp;I chose ten because it seemed like a nice number. &nbsp;It was small enough that I shouldn't expect too much clumping of the toothpicks (and unwanted correlations in the data), but large enough that I didn't have to drop and pick up a single toothpick a thousand times. &nbsp;I threw the groups of ten toothpicks 100 times and tallied the results. &nbsp;Thus, I have 1000 throws of a single needle.<br /><br />It took the entirety the movie <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undercover_Brother" style="font-style: italic;">Undercover Brother</a>&nbsp;to throw and pick up all those toothpicks, but when all was said and done I found that out of 1000 thrown toothpicks, 618 crossed the line. <br /><br />Plugging this back into our equation above (and remembering <i>l</i>&nbsp;= <i>d</i>), we get<br /><br />\[ \tilde{\pi}=\left(\frac{2l}{d}\right) \left(\frac{\mbox{Number of throws}}{\mbox{Number of crosses}} \right)=2 \left(\frac{1000}{618}\right)=3.23\]<br /><br />Well that's not too far off I guess. &nbsp;But it's certainly not the pi that I know and love. &nbsp;What went wrong?<br /><br />As I mentioned before, since I am only doing a finite number of runs here I am not finding the exact probability. &nbsp;So is there anyway to gauge our uncertainty? &nbsp;Sure. &nbsp;Since we are doing a counting experiment with a lot of events, we can approximate our error using Poisson statistics. &nbsp;For a Poisson distribution, the standard deviation is just the square root of the number of events (in this case, crosses). &nbsp;So we have that our total number of crosses is<br /><br />\[ \mbox{Number of crosses} = 618 \pm \sqrt{618} = 618 \pm 24.9 \]<br /><br />So now if we want to find the uncertainty in our final measurement, we'll have to propagate the error through. &nbsp;This gives us a final value of<br /><br />\[ \tilde{\pi} = 3.23 \pm 0.13 \]<br /><br />and we see that the exact value of pi falls within there. &nbsp;We can see that this value gets better and better if we plot our value of pi as a function of the number of throws. &nbsp;Figure 2 shows the measured value of pi (with error bars) over a wide range of throw numbers. &nbsp;The actual value of pi is plotted as a green line.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TQ0rGuJSDQI/AAAAAAAAAHs/Sllf1A-h1tw/s1600/buffonpi.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TQ0rGuJSDQI/AAAAAAAAAHs/Sllf1A-h1tw/s400/buffonpi.png" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Figure 2: Measured pi value in blue, actual in<br />green, click for bigger version</td></tr></tbody></table>So we see that the more toothpicks we drop, the closer and closer we get to pi. &nbsp;Hot dog! &nbsp;Certainly an evening well spent.
