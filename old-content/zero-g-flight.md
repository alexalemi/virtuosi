what is zero-g<br />how is it attained with a plane<br />video<br /><br />possible flight paths<br />try spherical<br />-constant \dot{\theta}, start r large, r changing to satisfy full energy equation<br />---limited by height of plane possible<br />---turn space for plane at bottom of fall<br />-high speed low r, tilt up and start zero-g here<br />---limited by max linear speed of plane<br />---turns space for plane at bottom of fall<br /><br />compare trajectories to mgh parabolic<br /><br />
