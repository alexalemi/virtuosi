Mine, as those of you who read this blog should know very well by now, is certainly <i>not</i>&nbsp;doing physics. &nbsp;Nope, my talent is watching TV. &nbsp;Seriously guys, I watch TV like a boss <a href="#note2">[2]</a><a id="back2"></a>. &nbsp;In light of this talent, I thought I would describe a few instances in which I have seen pi represented (for better or for worse) in TV and movies.<br /><br /><a name='more'></a>Over the last few months, I have been re-watching a lot of the TV show <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psych">Psych</a></i>&nbsp;with my good friend and fellow Virtuosi contributor, Matt "TT" Showbiz <a href="#note3">[3]</a><a id="back3"></a>. &nbsp;For the uninitiated, <i>Psych</i>&nbsp;is a detective show where the main characters (Shawn and Gus) run a (fake) psychic detective agency, which allows them to solve mysteries, engage in various shenanigans, and make an inordinate number of references to <i>Tears for Fears</i> frontman Curt Smith <a href="#note4">[4]</a><a id="back4"></a>.<br /><br />In one of the episodes, Shawn and Gus enter a room where a long train of digits is written across the top of the wall. &nbsp;It soon becomes evident that these are the digits of pi and the camera is sure to zoom in on the famous first few digits to reassure us. <br /><br />But there are hundreds of digits written out and I have very little faith in TV prop people when it comes to background mathematical expressions. &nbsp;So I decided to check it out. <br /><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sIqwUS9wlog/T17KQ7mU7nI/AAAAAAAAAV4/1hiiMuN-yxA/s1600/pi_psych1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="222" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sIqwUS9wlog/T17KQ7mU7nI/AAAAAAAAAV4/1hiiMuN-yxA/s400/pi_psych1.png" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Pi on the Wall (click to enhance for texture)</td></tr></tbody></table>Using a neat little pi <a href="http://www.angio.net/pi/piquery">searcher</a>, I checked to see if (and where) this sequence appeared in pi. &nbsp;Turns out it's legit and (almost!) correct. &nbsp;The first 105 digits of pi (counting after the three) are:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div id="showstring"><span style="background-color: white;">3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510582097494459230781640628620899862803482534211706<b><u>798</u></b>2148</span></div><div id="querytime" style="font-size: 13px; font-style: italic; margin-right: 5px; text-align: right;"></div></blockquote><span style="background-color: white;">where I have underlined the 99th, 100th, and 101st digits. &nbsp;Looking back at the writing on the wall, we see that the 100th digit has been duplicated.</span><br /><span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6vQ2gmfNULw/T17Nb29jAvI/AAAAAAAAAWA/2hMW9vdU3S0/s1600/pi_psych.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="222" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6vQ2gmfNULw/T17Nb29jAvI/AAAAAAAAAWA/2hMW9vdU3S0/s400/pi_psych.png" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Very Almost Pi</td></tr></tbody></table><span style="background-color: white;">So close! &nbsp;Oh well, nobody is perfect. &nbsp;Even though there is an error here, I very much appreciate that whoever was doing the set design decided to use the <i>actual</i>&nbsp;digits of pi. &nbsp;All too often I see nonsensical equations in the background of TV shows and movies when it would take <i>exactly the same</i>&nbsp;amount of work to put real equations there. &nbsp;So congratulations to you, O nameless prop-making intern!, for giving an accurate (well, to a part in 10^100) value of pi.</span><br /><span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span><br />Neat, so are there any other TV shows or movies that have pi in them? &nbsp;Well, there's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo18VIoR2xU" style="font-style: italic;">Pi</a>. &nbsp;<i>Pi</i>&nbsp;is film by Darren Aronofsky (<i>Requiem for a Dream</i>, etc)&nbsp;about a mathematician looking for patterns in the stock market. &nbsp;It's a pretty good movie with a really cool <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cq_QO_4Cx4&amp;feature=player_embedded">soundtrack</a> by Clint Mansell. &nbsp;It also appears to display the digits of pi in the opening credits. &nbsp;But does it? &nbsp;To the Youtube-mobile!<br /><br />You can watch the opening credits <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L61x5mbE-jc">here</a> if you like and here is a still image of the relevant section.<br /><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pEbkgRx-PFw/T17UHYdfhwI/AAAAAAAAAWI/vsyzWd139pg/s1600/sad_pi.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="210" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pEbkgRx-PFw/T17UHYdfhwI/AAAAAAAAAWI/vsyzWd139pg/s400/sad_pi.png" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Pi?</td></tr></tbody></table><span style="background-color: white;">Looks pretty cool, huh? &nbsp;But once we get past the slick aesthetics, we see that something doesn't seem right. &nbsp;This number they are showing appears at first glance to be our good friend pi, but after the 8th digit the cover is blown and we see that this is actually some&nbsp;impostor&nbsp;number! &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5afmhwZOhWk/T17U-d1okrI/AAAAAAAAAWQ/KB7NHwwOvQg/s1600/verysadpi.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="210" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5afmhwZOhWk/T17U-d1okrI/AAAAAAAAAWQ/KB7NHwwOvQg/s400/verysadpi.png" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">More like Darren Aron-wrong-sky.</td></tr></tbody></table>Now, I fully understand that this has no bearing whatsoever on the film and, in the grand scheme of things, is not a Big Deal. &nbsp;But it would have been just as easy to put the <i>real</i>&nbsp;digits of pi here instead of just random filler. <br /><br />The only way that this could possibly be better than the real deal would be if it is actually a secret code. &nbsp;I have not yet ruled this out, as the movie is entirely about looking for meaning in seemingly random numbers. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the difficulty in transcribing the numbers from the screen greatly outweighs the very small chance that this isn't just gibberish. &nbsp;Four hundred Quatloos to anyone who can tell me if this is a code or not!<br /><br /><br /><p id="note1">[1] And an above average Ninja Turtle to boot. <a href="#back1"> [back] </a></p> <p id="note2">[2] Yes, I am putting my TV watching skills on par with the talents of George Washington. &nbsp;In fact, the stoic way in which I&nbsp;persevered&nbsp;through the entirety of <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator:_The_Sarah_Connor_Chronicles">The Sarah Connor Chronicles</a>&nbsp;</i>in under two weeks was described by historian David McCullough as "Washingtonian." &nbsp;These are simply facts. <a href="#back2"> [back] </a></p> <p id="note3">[3] The extra "T" is for extra talent. <a href="#back3"> [back] </a></p>  <p id="note4">[4] A duo can <i>absolutely</i>&nbsp;have a frontman. &nbsp;For evidence, feel free to ask the not-George-Michael-guy from <i>Wham!</i>&nbsp;or the not-Paul-Simon-guy from <i>Simon &amp; Garfunkel</i>. <a href="#back4"> [back] </a></p>
