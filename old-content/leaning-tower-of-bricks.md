Here's a simple question with a counterintuitive answer:  How far away from a table can one stack bricks without the stack falling over?<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br />At first glance this problem seems tricky to solve.  We need to come up with a good strategy.  Let's review center of gravity to make our life easier first.  When solving problems with gravity on Earth, we can replace any object or set of objects with a single point (at the center of mass) with mass equal to the sum of the masses.  In this case, we can replace any number of bricks and with a single point and pretend that point has mass equal to all of those bricks.<br /><br />So if I have one brick, and I want to place it as far away as possible from the edge, where do I need to place it?  Using the idea above, we can replace the brick with a single point, as shown in the picture, which has mass equal to the brick.  <br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-H32NO4xvOss/TlHO3NaarcI/AAAAAAAAAEo/ywnDzxyd2ps/s1600/Untitleddrawing.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-H32NO4xvOss/TlHO3NaarcI/AAAAAAAAAEo/ywnDzxyd2ps/s320/Untitleddrawing.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5643519255960530370" /></a><br />If you imagine a small marble, this marble should be on top of the table in order to still remain on the table.  This gives us the maximal position of this brick.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-d35KAf9aJdM/TlHPkBz_AGI/AAAAAAAAAEw/Z4SQnBdDoEI/s1600/Untitleddrawing%2B%25281%2529.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-d35KAf9aJdM/TlHPkBz_AGI/AAAAAAAAAEw/Z4SQnBdDoEI/s320/Untitleddrawing%2B%25281%2529.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5643520025940656226" /></a><br /><br />Now let's try adding another brick on top of this one.  Again, we can replace both bricks with the center of mass of both of the bricks, as shown in the picture
