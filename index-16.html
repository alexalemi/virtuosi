<p>Stirring a bowl of honey is much more difficult than stirring a bowl of
water. But why? The mass density of the honey is about the same as that
of water, so we aren't moving more material. If we were to write out
Newton's equation, $ma$ would be about the same, but yet we still need
to put in much more force. Why? And can we measure it? </p>
<p>The reason that
honey is harder to stir is of course that the drag on our spoon depends
on more than just the density of the fluid. The drag also depends on the
viscosity of the fluid -- loosely speaking, how thick it is -- and the
viscosity of honey is about 400 times that of water, depending on the
conditions. In fact, a quick perusal of the Wikipedia article on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity">viscosity</a> 
shows that viscosities can vary by a fantastic amount -- some 13 orders of
magnitude, from easy-to-move gases to 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_drop_experiment">thick pitch</a> 
that behaves like a solid except on
long time scales. The situation is even more complicated than this, as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Newtonian_fluid">some fluids</a>
can have a viscosity that changes depending on the flow. I wanted to
find a way to measure the viscosities of the stuff around me, so I made
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscometer">viscometer</a> pictured below
for about $1.75 (the vending machines in Clark Hall are pretty
expensive).</p>
<div style="float: center">
<figure><img src="images/viscometer1/visc_fig1.jpg" alt="A PLOT???" width="40%"><figcaption> My homemade viscometer, taking data on the viscosity of water. </figcaption></figure>
</div>

<p>To do this, I </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Enjoyed the crisp, refreshing taste of Diet Pepsi from a 20 oz 
    bottle (come on, sponsorships).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cut the top and bottom off the bottle, so all that was left was a
    straight tube.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mounted the bottle with on top of a small piece of flat plastic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mounted a single-tubed coffee stirrer horizontally out of the bottle
    (I placed the end towards the middle of the bottle to avoid end
    effects).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Epoxied or glued the entire edge shut.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Marked evenly-spaced lines on the side of the bottle.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I can load my "sample" fluid in the top of the Pepsi bottle, and time
how long it takes for the sample level to drop to a certain point. A
more viscous fluid will take more time to leave the bottle, with the
time directly proportional to the viscosity. (This is a consequence of
Stokes flow and the equation for flow in a pipe. It will always be true,
as long as my fluid is viscous enough and my apparatus isn't too big.)</p>
<p>So we're done! All we need to do is calibrate our viscometer with one
sample, measure the times, and then we can go out and measure stuff in
the world! No need to stick around for the boring calculations! We can
do some fun science over the next few blog posts! </p>
<p>But this is a physics
blog written by a bunch of grad students, so I'm assuming that a few of
you want to see the details. (I won't judge you if you don't though.) If
we think about the problem for a bit, we basically have flow of a liquid
through a pipe (i.e. the coffee stirrer), plus a bunch of other crap
which hopefully doesn't matter much. </p>
<p>We first need to think about how
the fluid moves. We want to find the velocity of the fluid at every
position. This is best cast in the language of vector calculus -- we
have a (vector) velocity field $\vec{u}$ at a position $x$.
There are two things we know: 1) We don't (globally) gain or lose any
fluid, and 2) Newton's laws $F=ma$ hold. We can write these equations as
the Navier-Stokes equations: </p>
<p>$$ \vec{\nabla}\cdot \vec{u} = 0 \quad (1) $$ </p>
<p>$$ \rho \left( \frac {\partial \vec{u}} {\partial t} + (\vec{u}\cdot\vec{\nabla})\vec{u} \right) = - \vec{\nabla}p + \eta \nabla^2 \vec{u} \quad (2) $$ </p>
<p>The first equation basically
says that we don't have any fluid appearing or disappearing out of
nowhere, and the second is basically $m \vec{a}=\vec{F}$, except written per
unit volume. (The fluid's mass-per-unit-volume is $\rho$, the rate of
change of our velocity is $\frac{d\vec{u}}{dt}$, and our force per unit volume is
$\vec{\nabla}p$, plus a viscous term $\nabla^2 \vec{u}$. The only
complication is that $\frac{d\vec{u}}{dt}$ is a total derivative, which we need to
write as </p>
<p>$$ \frac{d\vec{u}}{dt} =  \frac{\partial \vec{u}}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial \vec{u}}{\partial x} \frac{d x}{d t}$$</p>
<p>I won't drag you through the 
<a href="http://www.4shared.com/office/y9ay-fNh/Homemade_viscometer_-gory_sect.html?refurl=d1url">gory details</a>,
unless you want to see them, but it turns out that for my system the
height of the fluid $h$ (measured from the coffee stirrer) versus time
$t$ is </p>
<p>$$ h(t) = h(0)e^{-t/T}, \quad T= 60.7 \textrm{sec} \times [\eta / \textrm{1 mPa s}] \times [\textrm{ 1 g/cc} / \rho] $$ </p>
<p>[For my viscometer, the coffee stirrer has length 13.34 cm and inside
diameter 2.4 mm, and the Pepsi bottle has a cross-sectional area of 36.3
square centimeters (3.4 cm inner radius). You can see how the timescale
scales with these properties in the 
<a href="http://www.4shared.com/office/y9ay-fNh/Homemade_viscometer_-gory_sect.html?refurl=d1url">gory details section</a>.]</p>
<div style="float: center;">
<figure><img src="images/viscometer1/visc_fig2.png" alt="A PLOT" width="70%"><figcaption style="font-size:small;">
     A run with measured heights vs times &amp; error bars. The
     majority of the uncertainty turns out to come from not knowing the
     exact proportions of the viscometer. I don't know exactly why the
     heights are systematically deviating from the fit, but I suspect it's
     that my gridlines aren't perfectly lined up with the bottom of my
     viscometer (it looks like $\sim 5$ mm off would do it, which I can totally
     believe looking at the picture of my viscometer). However, because of
     the linearity of the equations for steady flow in a pipe, we know that
     the time scales linearly with the viscosity, so we should be able to
     accurately measure relative viscosities.
</figcaption></figure>
</div>

<p>Well, how well does it work? Above is a plot of the height of water in
my viscometer versus time, with a best-fit value from the equations
above. To get a sense of my random errors (such as how good I am at
timing the flow), I measured this curve 5 separate times. If I take into
account the uncertainties in my apparatus setup as systematic errors, I
find a value for my viscosity as </p>
<p>$$ \eta \approx 1.429 \textrm{mPa s} \pm 0.5 \% \textrm{Rand.} \pm 55\% \textrm{Syst.} $$ </p>
<p>The actual value of the viscosity of water at room temperature (T=25 C) is about
$0.86~\textrm{mPa s}$, which is more-or-less within my systematic errors. So it
looks like I won't be able to measure absolute values of viscosity
accurately without a more precise apparatus. But if I look at the
variation of my measured viscosity, I see that I should probably be able
to measure changes in viscosity to 0.5% !! That's pretty good! Hopefully
over the next couple weeks I'll try to use my viscometer to measure some
interesting physics in the viscosity of fluids.</p>

<p>A couple weeks ago, I came home after a long day at work looking for a
break. I thought to myself, "What’s more fun than physics?" </p>
<p><a id="note1"></a>
Batman.<a href="posts/batman-helicopters-and-center-of-mass/#fnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>
<p>I sat down to play the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkham_City">latest Batman
videogame</a>, in which Batman’s
current objective was to use his grappling hook to jump onto an enemy
helicopter to steal an electronic MacGuffin. As awesome as this was, it
occurred to me that something was very wrong about the way the
helicopter moved while Batman zipped through the air. </p>
<p><a href="http://youtu.be/81qN-PHucqM?t=3m12s">See if you can spot it too</a>. (Watch for about 5
seconds after the video starts. Ignore the commentary. Note: The
grunting noises are the sounds that Batman makes if you shoot him with
bullets.) </p>
<p>What occurred to me was this: If the helicopter’s rotors
provided enough lift to balance the force of gravity, wouldn’t Batman’s
sudden additional weight cause the helicopter to fall out of the sky?
Also, to get lifted up into the air, the helicopter must be pulling up
on Batman: shouldn’t Batman also be pulling down on the helicopter? By
how much should we expect to see the helicopter’s altitude change? </p>
<p>To address the first question, let's go to Newton's second law: </p>
<p>$$ \sum \vec{F} = m\vec{a} $$ </p>
<p>Let’s assume that the helicopter is hovering
stationary, minding its own business, when Batman jumps onto it. Let's
also assume the helicopter pilots are totally oblivious to Batman and
make no flight corrections after Batman jumps onto it. In order to
hover, the lift from the helicopter's rotors exactly matched the pull of
gravity. </p>
<p>$$ \sum \vec{F} = \vec{F}<em gravity>{rotors} - \vec{F}</em> = 0 $$ </p>
<p>Batman's sudden additional weight would cause the helicopter to
start falling, as the forces would no longer balance: </p>
<p>$$ \sum \vec{F} = \vec{F}<em gravity>{rotors} - \vec{F}</em> - \vec{F}_{Batman} &lt; 0 $$</p>
<p>So the helicopter does accelerate (and move) when Batman jumps onto it.
How much does it move? Let’s assume there are no crazy winds or other
external forces acting on the helicopter or Batman while Batman grapples
onto the helicopter. “No external forces” means that momentum of
helicopter + Batman does not change during Batman's flight. </p>
<p>Let's make
things a little simpler and assume that neither Batman nor the
helicopter had any vertical momentum before Batman used his grappling
hook. (I can choose to approach this problem from a reference frame
where the center of mass is stationary. Choosing a frame where the
center of mass moves won't change the results, it will just make the
calculation more complicated.) Because the momentum of helicopter +
Batman does not change, then the center of mass does not move while
Batman zips through the air: </p>
<p>$$ \frac{d}{dt} y_{COM} = \frac{d}{dt} \frac{m_{Bat} y_{Bat} + m_{Copter} y_{Copter}}{m_{Bat} + m_{Copter}} = \frac{p}{m_{Bat} + m_{Copter}} = 0 $$</p>
<p>The center of mass must remain stationary, so we can find how much the
helicopter's height changes by if Batman starts on the ground (y = 0)
and both end up at the same height with Batman hanging from the
helicopter: </p>
<p>$$ y_{COM} = \frac{m_{Copter} y_{Copter} + m_{Bat} (0)}{m_{Bat} + m_{Copter}} = \frac{m_{Copter} y_{final} + m_{Bat} y_{final}}{m_{Bat} + m_{Copter}} $$ </p>
<p>$$ \Delta y = y_{Copter} - y_{final} = \frac{m_{Bat}}{m_{Bat} + m_{Copter}} y_{Copter}$$</p>
<p>Now, some numbers: The police helicopters in the game are pretty small,
probably about 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_206">1500 kg</a>. </p>
<p>Batman is a big guy who works out and probably weighs around 100 kg (220 lb).
Plus, he’s wearing body armor (hence surviving when bullets hit him) and
a utility belt and all of those other Bat-gadgets, which probably adds
about 30 kg ($\sim 30$ lb for the gadgets, 
$\sim30$ lb for the <a href="http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2011/February/Pages/ManufacturersAnswerMilitary%E2%80%99sCalltoReduceBodyArmorWeight.aspx">armor</a>).
If Batman has to grapple onto a helicopter 30 meters above him, then the
helicopter should drop out of the air by about 2.4 m. This is greater
than the height of Batman himself, and would be noticeable if the
helicopter physics in the game were perfect. Of course, if the
helicopters appearing in the game were the giant army helicopters (they
do carry rockets, after all), their mass would be much larger
$(\sim 5000-10000~{\rm kg})$ so the effect of Batman’s additional weight would be
much smaller. None of these considerations detracted from the fun I had
playing the game, but it did seem odd that the helicopters appeared to
be nailed to the sky instead of moving freely through the air. I’ll be
writing the game developers a strongly-worded letter directly. </p>

<p>Today is the transit of Venus, which, aside from being a totally rad
astronomical event, is also the perfect excuse to tell my favorite story
of an unlucky Frenchman (I have many). This is by no means new and, if
you've ever taken an astronomy course, you've probably already heard it.
It is perhaps the closest thing Astronomy has to a ghost story, told
though the glow of a flashlight on moonless nights to scare the
children. This is the story of Guillaume Le Gentil, a dude that just
couldn't catch a break.</p>
<!-- more -->

<p>Guillaume Joseph Hyacinthe Jean-Baptiste Le Gentil de la Galaisière was
a Frenchman with an incredibly long name. He was also an astronomer,
though he hadn't started out that way. Monsieur Le Gentil (as his
friends called him and so, then, shall we) had originally intended to
enter the priesthood. However, he soon began sneaking away to hear
astronomy lectures and quickly switched from studies of Heaven to those
heavens more readily observed in a telescope. Le Gentil happened to get
into the astronomy game at a very exciting time. The next pair of Venus
transits was imminent and astronomers were giddy with anticipation.
Though the previous transit of 1639 had been predicted, it was met with
little fanfare and only a few measurements. But the transits of 1761 and
1769 would be different. People would be ready. And the stakes were
higher this time, too. Soon after the 1639 transit, Edmund Halley (he of
the-only-comet-people-can-name fame) calculated that with enough
simultaneous measurements, the distance from the Earth to the Sun (the
so-called astronomical unit, or AU) could be measured fairly accurately.
Since almost all other astronomical distances were known in terms of the
AU, knowing its precise value would essentially set the scale for the
cosmos. Brand new telescopes in hand, the astronomers of Europe set sail
for locations all over the world.</p>
<p>Le Gentil had been assigned to observe the transit from Pondicherry, a
French holding on the eastern side of India. On March 26th, 1760, he
began his long sea voyage around the Cape of Good Hope towards India.</p>
<p>The voyage from France to India was a bit too long for the ship Le
Gentil hitched a ride on and he only made it as far as Mauritius (a
small island off Madagascar). Dropped off with all his equipment, Le
Gentil was left waiting for any ship at all to take him to Pondicherry.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was the Curse of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodo">Dodo</a> or perhaps it was just bad
luck, but while he was waiting, Le Gentil learned that
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Years'_War">war</a> had broken out
between the French and the British, making a trip to British India very
difficult for a Frenchman.</p>
<p>Then the monsoon season started, meaning that even if he could find a
ship, it would have to take a much longer route to India than initially
planned and that it would be very difficult to make the journey before
the transit occurred.</p>
<p>Then, he caught dysentery for the first time.</p>
<p>Finally, after months of waiting, Le Gentil (barely recovered from his
illness) left Mauritius for India in February of 1761. Though time
appeared to be running out, the captain of the ship he was on promised
he would be there to observe the transit in June. About halfway to
India, the winds switched directions and the ship was forced to turn
back to Mauritius.</p>
<p>Le Gentil dutifully observed the transit of Venus in 1761 from a rocky
ship in the middle of the Indian Ocean. The data were useless and he
never attempted any analysis.</p>
<p>Although he missed the first transit, these things come in pairs
separated by eight years. There was still another chance. And with all
this time to prepare, there was no way he was going to miss the second
one.</p>
<p>In fact, there was a bit <em>too much</em> time. But as a world-traveling 18th
century man of science, Le Gentil had plenty of other interests to fill
his days. He was particularly interested in surveying the region around
Madagascar.</p>
<p>So he made a really nice map of Madagascar. And then he ate some bad
kind of some kind of animal and came down with a terrible sickness. He
describes this illness and its "cure" in his journals:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This sickness was a sort of violent stroke, of which several very
copious blood-lettings made immediately on my arm and my foot, and
emetic administered twelve hours afterwards, rid me of it quite
quickly. But there remained for seven or eight days in my optic nerve
a singular impression from this sickness; it was to see two objects in
the place of one, beside each other; this illusion disappeared little
by little as I regained my strength...</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After recovering from both his sickness and the treatment, Le Gentil
decided to begin his preparations for the 1769 transit of Venus. He
calculated that either Manila or the Mariana Islands would be the ideal
spot to observe. The Sun would be relatively high in the sky at both
places when Venus passed by, meaning that the view would be through less
atmosphere with a reduced chance of clouds passing through the line of
sight. Le Gentil packed up his stuff and headed off to Manila, where he
could catch another ship to get to the Mariana Islands. Arriving in
Manila in 1766, the astronomer found himself exhausted from months of
sickness and sea-voyage. So, when he was offered passage on a ship
heading to the Mariana Islands, he quickly declined. That he chose not
to depart Manila at that time was perhaps his one stroke of good luck in
the entire journey. The ship sunk. Writing in his journal, Le Gentil
appears to have developed that particular sense of humor that generally
accompanies constant disappointment:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It is true that only three or four people were drowned, those who
were the most eager to save themselves, which is what almost always
happens in shipwrecks. I cannot answer that I would not have
increased the number of persons eager to save themselves.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In any case, Le Gentil was in Manila with plenty of time to prepare for
the next transit. Unfortunately, the astronomer may have over-prepared.
Having arrived three years before the event, he now had three years to
worry and second-guess his decision. It didn't help that the Spanish
governor of Manila was kind of a crazy person. Not wanting to miss the
observation of a lifetime owing to the whims of mildly insane strong
man, Le Gentil packed up his stuff and headed to Pondicherry. Finally in
Pondicherry, Le Gentil worked tirelessly to construct his observatory
and make plenty of astronomical observations in preparation for the
event. He had state of the art equipment and had fully calibrated and
double checked everything. It was now nine years since his journey began
and only a few days until the transit was scheduled to occur at sunrise
on June 4th. The entire month of May was beautiful weather and pristine
observing conditions, as were the first few days of June. Le Gentil
likely went to bed on the 3rd of June fully confident that the next
morning would be no different. He woke up early in the morning to begin
preparations for his sunrise observations only to find clouds on the
horizon. The clouds remained, obscuring the sun, all through the
duration of the transit. A few hours after the end of the transit, the
sun broke through the clouds and remained visible for the rest of the
day. Le Gentil had missed his second transit in Pondicherry. He sums it
up in his journal:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>That is the fate which often awaits astronomers. I had gone more
than ten thousand leagues; it seemed that I had crossed such a great
expanse of seas, exiling myself from my native land, only to be the
spectator of a fatal cloud which came to place itself before the sun
at the precise moment of my observation, to carry off from me the
fruits of my pains and of my fatigues</em></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In Manila, the Sun rose in perfectly clear skies. Distraught, Le Gentil
remained in bed for some weeks afterward. He soon caught a fever and
missed the ship that was supposed to take him home. He recovered, but
then came down with dysentery again. Barely recovered from his various
illnesses, he managed to get a ride back to Mauritius. He caught a ship
leaving the island in November of 1770. The ship was struck by a
hurricane and almost completely destroyed. It managed to limp back to
Mauritius. The second attempt proved more successful and Le Gentil
finally "set foot on France at nine o'clock in the morning, after eleven
years, six months and thirteen days of absence." Though he had finally
made it home, he was not out of the woods quite yet. In his absence, Le
Gentil's heirs had tried to declare him dead to gain their inheritance,
his accountant had mishandled (and lost) a large chunk of his holdings,
and the Academy of Sciences, which had sent him on his 11 year mission,
had given his seat to someone else. It was not quite the welcome home he
had hoped for. Despite his seemingly never-ending misfortune, things did
turn around for Le Gentil. He married, had a daughter, and was
reinstated into the Academy of Sciences. Presumably, he lived out the
rest of his days in relative happiness. Le Gentil died in 1792. Keeping
true to his style, this man who missed two of the most important
astronomical events of his time fortunately managed to also miss the
most important (and violent) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reign_of_Terror">political
event</a> of his time.</p>
