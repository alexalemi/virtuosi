  Corky, Matt, and Jared, with the experimental apparatus.</p>
<hr>
<p>There's a place where TV remotes are flashlights, Wii's are torches, and
Snuggies are translucent. It's our kitchen. We modified a 3 dollar
webcam to view in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.
We'll show you how, and what you can do with it. First, a little bit of
background. If you read the previous post by Alex, you'd know that
visible light waves are the same kind of waves as radio waves,
microwaves, and x-rays; they just wave at different frequencies. Light
that has a frequency just below what we can see is called "infrared",
which apparently derives from the latin <em>infra--</em>below red (thanks
wikipedia!). So we know that if we get an object hot enough, it will
glow visibly. However, warm objects (say, humans, cars, tanks) while not
emitting enough visible light to glow, will emit easily detectable
infrared light. This makes infrared imaging a handy technology for
finding warm things in the dark. And, since many opaque things in the
visible are transparent in the infrared (or vice versa), you can dream
up a lot of fun to be had if you could only see in the infrared. Well,
it turns out that the CCDs in many common webcams are sensitive to the
infrared (IR). However, since an infrared signal would make for a weird
looking visible light picture, it is simply filtered out. Well, we
(mostly Matt) got our hands on such a
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019WF4FE/ref=oss_product">webcam</a>,
for a whopping 3 dollars, and removed the filter. Then we turned the
tables, and inserted a visible light filter. For this we used the
darkest part of a developed film roll, and while not getting rid of all
the visible, it did a pretty good job with the lights down low. You can
get a junk roll from your local Rite Aid photo center for free, just ask
for Sue. She is very helpful. So we took some pictures of whatever we
could find that was a strong IR source. It turns out that our particular
camera wasn't sensitive to detect the signal of a warm human (or a cold
one for that matter). We had to get something just a little hotter. So
we lit a stick on fire, and then blew it out. Here's what it looks like
in the now very pedestrian visible spectrum, with the lights out:
<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TU4e6vuACII/AAAAAAAAAJY/gD53zNX1nDI/s1600/stick+visible.jpg"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TU4e6vuACII/AAAAAAAAAJY/gD53zNX1nDI/s320/stick+visible.jpg"></a>
It's just barely glowing. Now, let's look at it in what I'll call
"enhanced" visible with the lights on, meaning that it's sensitive to
both IR and visible at the same time.
<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TU4ff9P0ljI/AAAAAAAAAJc/X5a75LQKr-Q/s1600/stick+enhanced.jpg"><img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TU4ff9P0ljI/AAAAAAAAAJc/X5a75LQKr-Q/s320/stick+enhanced.jpg"></a>
The infared obviously dominates the output. It looks like an IR
sparkler. Now, let's shut the lights off, and see only IR:
<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TU4g8q5tiZI/AAAAAAAAAJk/qLct2HN-ZuQ/s1600/stick+infra.jpg"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TU4g8q5tiZI/AAAAAAAAAJk/qLct2HN-ZuQ/s320/stick+infra.jpg"></a>
It's bright enough to "light up" my hand, which it certainly couldn't do
in the visible. Okay, so we had to light this thing on fire, and it was
already glowing. Well, my response to that is...this spoon:
<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TU4iF8qPjjI/AAAAAAAAAJo/kywO7JDYG3Q/s1600/hot+spoon+vis.jpg"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TU4iF8qPjjI/AAAAAAAAAJo/kywO7JDYG3Q/s400/hot+spoon+vis.jpg"></a>
Normal spoon. But actually we heated it up a bit on the stove. Here it
is in enhanced visible:
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TU4iR1HraFI/AAAAAAAAAJs/qjk-xDgyFkM/s1600/hot+spoon+enhanced.jpg"><img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TU4iR1HraFI/AAAAAAAAAJs/qjk-xDgyFkM/s320/hot+spoon+enhanced.jpg"></a>
And now, lights off, infrared only:
<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TU4ikGGMEfI/AAAAAAAAAJw/gYsusNx8RNw/s1600/hot+spoon+dark.jpg"><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TU4ikGGMEfI/AAAAAAAAAJw/gYsusNx8RNw/s320/hot+spoon+dark.jpg"></a>
Apparently we only heated up the tip significantly.
Now, we have a super high tech flashlight that has three modes. It can
produce green LED light, white LED light, or incandescent white light.
Corky pointed each one at me. White LED light, visible:
<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TU4jmRe24EI/AAAAAAAAAJ0/c4h7wMdW_7c/s1600/jared+white.jpg"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TU4jmRe24EI/AAAAAAAAAJ0/c4h7wMdW_7c/s320/jared+white.jpg"></a>
Creepy, eh? It's the shaved head.
Now, white LED light in the IR:
<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TU4kEKAtnEI/AAAAAAAAAJ4/RKKCmhRxu5Q/s1600/dark.jpg"><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TU4kEKAtnEI/AAAAAAAAAJ4/RKKCmhRxu5Q/s320/dark.jpg"></a>
Nuthin' doin'. Similarly for green LED light. This is included only for
its creepiness. First, in the visible:
<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TU4kTWeT2-I/AAAAAAAAAJ8/ZAJ3aUCC2qY/s1600/jared+green.jpg"><img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TU4kTWeT2-I/AAAAAAAAAJ8/ZAJ3aUCC2qY/s320/jared+green.jpg"></a>
Corky calls this "the most palatable [pronounced incorrectly] picture of
Jared we could find." In the IR, nada:
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TU4kkgkjufI/AAAAAAAAAKA/I8kV2SZKpiE/s1600/dark+2.jpg"><img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TU4kkgkjufI/AAAAAAAAAKA/I8kV2SZKpiE/s320/dark+2.jpg"></a>
But for incandescent white, in visible:
<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TU4kvV7Z5fI/AAAAAAAAAKE/0jHh-_5huRg/s1600/jared+incan.jpg"><img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TU4kvV7Z5fI/AAAAAAAAAKE/0jHh-_5huRg/s320/jared+incan.jpg"></a>
And IR:
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TU4k7_LZAbI/AAAAAAAAAKI/eTZdYYArUdc/s1600/jared+infra.jpg"><img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TU4k7_LZAbI/AAAAAAAAAKI/eTZdYYArUdc/s320/jared+infra.jpg"></a>
I am aglow! Matt is clearly shocked. This happens because light
generated by LED's occurs because of electrons hopping around
semi-definite energy states of a material, making semi-definite
frequencies of light. However, incandescent light is due to the filament
being glowing hot, emitting radiation over a wide range of frequencies,
and we know that it's got a strong contribution in the IR.
So much for hot things. You have a bunch of IR dedicated sources around
your house that maybe you didn't know about. One such source is many TV
remote controls. Here we are, in the visible, with the lights low,
pointing remotes at our faces.
<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TU4mbYxxVWI/AAAAAAAAAKM/bR-WdOFTQ0o/s1600/remotes+vis.jpg"><img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TU4mbYxxVWI/AAAAAAAAAKM/bR-WdOFTQ0o/s320/remotes+vis.jpg"></a>
This is actually a promo pic for our 80's new wave band. Here's what
this looks like, with buttons depressed, in the IR:
<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TU4nENHKUoI/AAAAAAAAAKQ/waQc1sh3AS4/s1600/remotes+infra.jpg"><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TU4nENHKUoI/AAAAAAAAAKQ/waQc1sh3AS4/s320/remotes+infra.jpg"></a>
A personal favorite.
These remotes weren't the brightest source we could find. It turns out
that the Wii sensor bar (which actually transmits, rather than receives
data) is a freakin' beacon (say that out loud). Here it is, on top of
our TV, which Corky is apparently flying towards.
<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TU4oAdkkSQI/AAAAAAAAAKU/HVn-di40lSA/s1600/corky+flying.jpg"><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TU4oAdkkSQI/AAAAAAAAAKU/HVn-di40lSA/s320/corky+flying.jpg"></a>
Unassuming little guy in the visible. But with the Wii on and in IR
mode:
<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TU4ocjPYcBI/AAAAAAAAAKY/eJkV5XE4GAs/s1600/wii+dark.jpg"><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TU4ocjPYcBI/AAAAAAAAAKY/eJkV5XE4GAs/s320/wii+dark.jpg"></a>
There's a person in there too, IR bathing. But I promised you
translucent Snuggies. (Yes, we own a Snuggie, and highly recommend
them.) Here's Matt hiding behind one, whilst I angrily supervise:
<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TU4o-dCYcdI/AAAAAAAAAKc/ppkhs3o9nKc/s1600/snuggie+visible.jpg"><img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TU4o-dCYcdI/AAAAAAAAAKc/ppkhs3o9nKc/s320/snuggie+visible.jpg"></a>
Now, let's look behind the curtain with IR:
<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TU4pM05CabI/AAAAAAAAAKg/lNEwZMLrL2g/s1600/snuggie+infra.jpg"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TU4pM05CabI/AAAAAAAAAKg/lNEwZMLrL2g/s320/snuggie+infra.jpg"></a>
Look, I told you it was a Snuggie, the sleeve is visible! Now, if we had
more resolution, we could even pick out a person in a dark room, and
look at the temperature variations of objects. However, with
approximately an hour of fiddling and 3 dollars, I think we did pretty
good. We're not hard to entertain, but this definitely did the trick.</p>

<p>There's a lot of free data sets floating around the internet, and while
things like funny cat videos and the <a href="http://blog.xkcd.com/2010/05/03/color-survey-results/">results of color-naming
surveys</a> get a
lot of play, many others don't get used for much. Recently I've been
playing around with one such data set: images from the <a href="http://aviris.jpl.nasa.gov/">Airborne
Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer
(AVIRIS)</a>.</p>
<p>I've always found it interesting that the way we perceive color is very
different from how light actually works. Most of us have three different
types of cones in our eyes and we perceive different colors as different
combinations of stimuli to these three types of cones. In a very rough
sense, when we look at a color, our brain gets three different numbers
to figure out what it is. Light, on the other hand, is a bunch of
photons with some distribution of wavelengths. To fully describe the
light coming from an object you need a function that shows how many
photons are at any given wavelength, which is way more complicated than
just the three numbers we get.</p>
<p>So what about all that information that gets thrown away on the way to
our brain? Are we missing out on a magical world of super-duper colors
and wonder? Not really, but skip past the break anyways to find out
more.</p>
<p>There are a few things our eyes have a hard time distinguishing. For
example, take a look at this picture of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium-vapor_lamp#Low_pressure_sodium">low-pressure sodium
lamp</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:LPS_Lamp_35W_running.jpg"><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_f2jEPVoC9C4/TUx02kW16bI/AAAAAAAABI0/vonaPzNiAag/s320/LPS_Lamp_35W_running.jpg"></a></p>
<p>If you've ever been in a sketchy parking lot at night or an intro
physics class you've probably seen one of these in real life. It looks
just like the picture right? It does to us, but the light coming from
the picture and the light from the real lamp are totally different. All
the photons from the real lamp have wavelengths very close to 589
nanometers, while the ones coming from the picture on your screen have a
bunch of different wavelengths ranging from 500 to 700 nanometers,
depending on what type of monitor you have. (It's easy to <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7Ezhuxj/astro/html/spectrometer.html">build your
own
spectrometer</a>
and see this for yourself.)</p>
<p><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?gl=us&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=37.432068,-122.017937&amp;spn=0.196834,0.308647&amp;t=h&amp;z=12"><img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_f2jEPVoC9C4/TUx1kWr0ZpI/AAAAAAAABI8/K7RQ-Qzxa50/s400/Moffett%2BField%2BCrop.jpg"></a>This
is an extreme example since there are few objects that emit purely
monochromatic light. What do normal objects look like spectroscopically?
I wanted to find out, but unfortunately there's not too many
freely-available spectroscopic images of everyday objects floating
around the internet, and my attempts to make my own were stymied by the
fact that no one wanted to let me borrow $20,000 worth of optical
bandpass filters. However, there are a several orbital satellites and
planes which take spectroscopic images of the earth, and one of them,
AVIRIS, has a few sample data sets for people to play around with. I
recently wrote some code to help me look at one data set in particular –
a spectroscopic image of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moffett_Federal_Airfield">Moffett Federal
Airfield</a> in
California, shown here in a normal picture from Google Earth.</p>
<p>AVIRIS acts much like a normal camera, but instead of three wide-band
filters for distinguishing color it uses 225 narrow bands ranging from
366 nanometers (near UV) to 2500 nanometers (near IR). Any of these
bands can be thought of as a single monochromatic image. Here I have
plotted two bands side by side for comparison. The right image is at 463
nanometers (a nice blue color) and the other is at 2268 nanometers, well
into the infrared. (Both images are false-colored to enhance the
contrast).</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_f2jEPVoC9C4/TUx2M29FDwI/AAAAAAAABJE/lSUTxxI4ZFw/s1600/Img10and200withInsets.png"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_f2jEPVoC9C4/TUx2M29FDwI/AAAAAAAABJE/lSUTxxI4ZFw/s400/Img10and200withInsets.png"></a></p>
<p>The scene looks a lot different at the two different wavelengths. In the
first image there's one area that's particularly bright – it is one of
several settling ponds belonging to a Morton Salt factory, although I
have no idea what is special about this one that makes it reflect blue
light so strongly. The second image highlights different features and
clearly shows the difference between the moving water in the creeks and
the standing water in the bay.</p>
<p>These are just two of the bands, but you can see all of them fly by in
the movie below. (Note that the color scale is set for each band
individually, which is why there sometimes seems to be a large change
between adjacent bands).</p>
<p>If you agree with me that the embedded video looks super-crappy you can
<a href="http://gotfork.net/virtuosi/VariableGain.avi">download the original
here</a> (6.4 MB).</p>
<p>One of the things that struck me about this video is that it seems like
much of the image doesn't change too much through the whole visual
range. Not surprisingly, it's a lot easier for us to distinguish between
the slight differences in color in a normal image than it is for us to
distinguish between the slight changes of intensity here.</p>
<p>So what do the spectra of individual points in the image look like?
Let's focus on a few easily-identifiable objects. (I'll talk about how I
made the roughly-true color image below in a later post).</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_f2jEPVoC9C4/TUx7dCumIAI/AAAAAAAABJk/9b8gXeMkqg4/s1600/FiveLocMapCombo.png"><img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_f2jEPVoC9C4/TUx7dCumIAI/AAAAAAAABJk/9b8gXeMkqg4/s400/FiveLocMapCombo.png"></a></p>
<p>The first thing that stands out is that there's a lot of features that
are common to all of the locations, such as the big gap near 1750
nanometers. While the sun sends photons with a distribution of
wavelengths roughly described by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law">Planck's
Law</a>, certain wavelengths
are strongly absorbed by gasses in the atmosphere as shown below:</p>
<p><a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Solar_Spectrum.png"><img alt="image" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Solar_Spectrum.png"></a></p>
<p>Looking at the different spectra we can see that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_absorption_by_water">liquid water absorbs
strongly in the
infrared</a>,
and the green grass on the golf course reflects strongly in the
near-infrared (no clue why). There is also a clear difference in
intensities for each of the locations in the visual range, but the five
locations otherwise look quite similar, even though they are very
different colors in real life.</p>
<p>I'll look at a few more interesting things in this data set and talk a
bit about about how our eyes and brains process color in a later post.</p>

<p>In the next posts, I'd like to attempt to make a camera from 'scratch.'
And by that, I mean explore the creation of cameras from their
components and then create a very primitive one from readily available
materials.</p>
<p>In terms of history and simplicity, we should start with the pinhole
camera. I've heard stories that Newton used a pinhole camera to look at
the sun though I don't know if this was before or after he stared
directly at it for 8 minutes. The pinhole is neat because it is so
simple. With a pinhole, light is focused simply by restricting the paths
which an incident ray may take to hit our film. Typically, diffuse and
specular scattering sends light bouncing every which way off an object.
The pinhole just restricts which directions hit the film. I think a
picture is a better guide to this concept.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_qY9DSyjj8Ro/TUtOYzRfZAI/AAAAAAAAB3Y/MoKfumAjRTs/s400/pinholes2.png"></p>
<p>For a small hole (aperture) there is approximately one area of the
object that will send rays to a particular part of the image. Of course
there is a very small angle of error for pinhole cameras made with
millimeter sized pins. As the hole increases in size, more rays are
incident to the same section of film. And finally, when the hole is big
enough for the whole object to be seen through it (think window), no
cohesive image is formed.</p>
<p>So if we make the hole small enough, then we can have all the clarity we
want, right? Well, I guess so. It would have to be a very circular hole
and it would only let in a very tiny amount of light making exposure
times long. How to fix this?</p>
<p>Yea, you guessed it. A lens is the answer. It is able to focus light on
its own. Now we can collect more light and still make clear images. But
the catch is that it only works for a range of distances. So again, lets
consider a lens and the images of two objects at different distances.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_qY9DSyjj8Ro/TUtO6Js1a6I/AAAAAAAAB3g/6s0Nh2XYoFY/s1600/lenses2.png"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_qY9DSyjj8Ro/TUtO6Js1a6I/AAAAAAAAB3g/6s0Nh2XYoFY/s400/lenses2.png"></a></p>
<p>Ray drawing can be done with 3 simple rules (though two are needed in
practice).</p>
<ul>
<li>rays that go in parallel to the axis go out through the focal point</li>
<li>rays that go in through the focal point go out parallel (time
    reversal symmetry)</li>
<li>rays that go through the center are not altered</li>
</ul>
<p>Using these rules, the first object which is at the proper distance for
the film position and focal length of the lens is in focus. However, the
rays from the object further away do not converge at the film and so are
out of focus.</p>
<p>Here its time for two experiments.</p>
<p>\1) <strong>The Window Camera</strong> Go to a room with a single window and cover it
with thick paper that has a single hole in it. Given enough light, you
should see an image on the far wall. If not, hold a piece of white paper
up close to the hole. [Edit: I just learned this has a name: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_obscura">camera
obscura</a>]</p>
<p>\2) <strong>The Doorway Camera</strong> Now, find a lens and a doorway. In one room,
leave the light on and go to the far wall in the dark room. Bring the
lens to the wall until you can see an image. The doorway is the
aperature, lens the lens, and wall the film. This demonstration is very
simple and not too surprising. BUT SO COOL. I encourage it <em>vigorously</em>.
The following pictures were taken of my images in case you can't find a
lens. [Edit: I guess this falls under camera obscura too]</p>

extra small image (\~1cm on a side) from the lens that will be in next
post's camera.</p>
<p>Together, these two elements – aperture and lens – make a very good
camera. The lens is able to collect a lot of light and focus it on the
film. The aperture can enhance clarity by reducing the number of paths
that light rays can take to your lens. It also provides higher order
corrections that come from the fact that the lens is probably not
perfect. That is, lenses are notorious for misbehaving around the edges
and introduce displacements in the whole image as well as between the
colors. The aperture helps keep light from traveling through these
edges.</p>
<p>Next time, a very simple camera.</p>

  Ned Flanders' credit card doesn't satisfy the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm">Luhn</a> checksum, but could probably still be erased by a magnetar.</p>
<hr>
<p>Hello, Internet! Today I'd like to talk about the Magnetar Credit Card
Swipe. Sounds like some sinister short on a derivatives deal, doesn't
it? Well, no need to worry, we don't deal with scary things like that
here. Instead, we are going to talk about a super-magnetized neutron
star speeding past Earth. A while ago I heard that a magnetar can erase
all the world's credit cards from half the distance to the moon. I did a
little research and it seems like this is the go-to "fun fact" about
magnetars. Almost every time they are brought up in a popular science
article, their credit card-erasing prowess is sure to get a mention. So
let's check it out! First things first, though. What the heck is a
magnetar [1]? Well, "magnetar" is just a spiffy name for a particular
flavor of neutron star. Now, neutron stars are already pretty extreme
objects. They've got a little more than the mass of the sun squished
down to the size of a big city with a central density over 10 trillion
times greater than lead.</p>

  Dipolar magnetic field</p>
<hr>
<p>What makes magnetars truly name-worthy (and more extreme than Doritos
and Mountain Dew at the X-Games) is the fact that they have strong
magnetic fields. And when I say strong, I mean <em>really</em> strong. Taking
the magnetic field to be dipolar (like the Earth's, see figure), the
field at the poles of a magnetar can be as high as 10^15 gauss [2]. For
comparison, the magnetic field of the Earth is about half a gauss and
the big magnets used in MRIs are about 10^4 gauss. So we're talking
about some big fields! Looking up the specs for a typical credit card,
it looks like most take about 1000 gauss to erase. And now we can get
started. I always forget the exact form of the magnetic field of a
dipole, but Jackson doesn't. He tells me that it is $$
\vec{B}\left(\vec{r}\right) =
\frac{3\vec{n}\left(\vec{n}\cdot\vec{m}\right) -
\vec{m}}{|\vec{r} |^3}$$ where m is the magnetic dipole moment, r is
the displacement vector to where we are measuring the field, and n is a
unit vector that points to where we are measuring. To find the magnitude
(which is what we really care about), we just take the dot product of
the vector with itself and take the square root. Working this out we get
$$ B\left(\vec{r}\right) = \frac{|\vec{m}|}{r^3}{\left[
3\cos^2{\theta}+1\right]}^{1/2} $$ where theta is the angle between
the magnetic moment vector and the direction vector n. But we are just
looking for a rough estimate here so let's just set the cosine term to
one. Now we have
$$ B\left(r\right) = \frac{2|\vec{m}|}{r^3}$$
We can now use the above to our advantage. Since we are assuming we know
the polar magnetic field strength, we can rearrange and solve for the
magnetic moment. At the pole of a star the distance is just going to be
the radius, so for radius R and field strength Bp, we get
$$ |\vec{m}|} = \frac{1}{2}B_{p}R^3 $$
Plugging this back in, we get a nice little formula for the strength of
the magnetic field in terms of the stellar radius and the polar field
strength
$$B(r) = B_{p}{\left(\frac{R}{r}\right)}^3 $$
And we are almost there! Rearranging now for r, we get $$r =
R{\left[\frac{B_p}{B(r)}\right]}^{1/3} $$ Huzzah! Now we just need
to plug in some values. Well, we'll use Bp = 10^15 gauss, B(r) = 1000
gauss (strong enough field to erase credit cards) and R = 10 km, which
gives... $$ r \approx 10km \times
{\left(\frac{10^{15}gauss}{10^{3}gauss}\right)}^{1/3} $$ so $$ r
\approx \mbox{100,000 km} $$ The moon is about 380,000 km away. So we
find that the magnetar will erase all credit cards up to a little over a
quarter the distance to the moon. Not bad! However, all this talk of
"half" and "quarter" is a bit misleading given that our best guesses
here will be order of magnitude. But, overall, we see that a magnetar at
roughly the Earth-Moon distance would have a good shot at erasing your
credit cards. Fun fact confirmed!

It's been a while since I posted anything, much to my shame. Hopefully
this post marks a change in that streak. Today I'm going to consider a
very practical application of all this physics stuff. One of my
housemates parks his car on the side of the house, with the front of the
car facing the house. Living in Ithaca, NY, the weather has been the
usual cold and snowy, like the rest of the northeast USA this winter.
Yet, early last week, we had some unusually warm weather, in the 30s
(fahrenheit). A few days later, my housemate went out to his car, and
discovered that falling chunks of ice had broken his windshield! Now, to
be clear here, I'm not talking about icicles, I'm talking about large,
block-like, chunks. My best guess is that during the warm days, snow on
the roof turned into chunks of ice, and slid off the roof. The question
I'm going to try to answer today is: How far from the house could these
chunks possibly land? Put another way, what I want to know is, how far
from the house would we have to park our cars to not risk broken
windshields from falling ice? <strong>The First Attempt</strong> We'll start with the
simplest assumptions we can think of. First, we'll assume that there is
no friction on the ice block as it slides down the roof. We'll also
assume there's no air resistance slowing down the ice in the air. The
maximum range will be given by a block of ice sliding from the top of
the roof. Taking the height of the peak of the roof as h, relative to
the edge of the roof, we can write down the magnitude of the velocity of
the ice chunk when it reaches the edge of the roof. We start by setting
the change in gravitational potential energy equal to the change in
kinetic energy. Recalling the form for both of these, $$PE=mgh$$
$$KE=\tfrac{1}{2}mv^2$$ we can set these equal and solve for v, $$mgh
= \tfrac{1}{2}mv^2$$ so $$|v|=\sqrt{2gh}$$ This should be a familiar
expression to anyone who went through introductory mechanics. Now, given
that the roof is at an angle theta, we can write down the x (horizontal)
and y (vertical) components of velocity, $$v_x=|v|\cos\theta$$
$$v_y=-|v|\sin \theta$$ where I've introduced a minus sign in the y
component of velocity to indicate that the ice chunk is falling. Now
that we have the velocity, we have to call upon some more kinematics. To
figure out how far the ice flies, we have to know how long it is in the
air. So we start by considering the vertical motion. The distance
traveled by an object with an initial velocity, v_0, and a constant
acceleration, a, is given by $$\Delta y=\tfrac{1}{2}at^2+v_0t$$ In
our case, the distance traveled is the height of the first two floors of
my house. The acceleration is that of gravity, g, and the initial
velocity is the y component of velocity we found above. We'd like to
find the time it takes to travel this distance. We have to be a little
careful with our minus signs, by our convention the acceleration is in
the negative direction, and the change in position is negative. Working
all of that out, and plugging in our known values, we get
$$\tfrac{1}{2}gt^2+|v|\sin \theta t - l =0$$ where l is the height
of the house. We can solve this for t, finding $$t=\frac{-|v|\sin
\theta + \sqrt{(|v|\sin \theta)^2+2gl}}{g}$$ The horizontal
distance traveled is simply the horizontal velocity times the time,
$$x=\frac{|v|\cos\theta}{g}(-|v|\sin \theta + \sqrt{(|v|\sin
\theta)^2+2gl})$$ a result that you may recognize as the 'projectile
range formula' (particularly if I brought the minus on the v sine theta
term into the sine, indicating that I'm firing at a negative angle, that
is, downwards). Having found that result, lets plug in our velocity, and
then some numbers. First,
$$x=\frac{\sqrt{2gh}\cos\theta}{g}(\sqrt{2gh}\sin \theta +
\sqrt{(2gh\sin^2 \theta+2gl})$$ Now, for some estimation. I'd say
that the height of the roof peak is 10 ft, the height of the first two
floors of the house is 20 ft, and the angle of the roof is 30 degrees.
Having made those estimates, now I just have to plug in all the numbers,
yielding $$x=5.2 m=17 ft$$ That's a very long range! Now, I didn't see
any chunks of ice that were more than about 7 ft from the house. So we
have to question what went wrong with the above derivation. Well, maybe
nothing went wrong. I did calculate the <em>maximum</em> range. It's quite
possible none of these ice chunks were from the very top of the roof.
Still, I'm inclined to think we may have overestimated. I'd say that our
initial velocity was too high. The ice, as it comes down the roof, will
have to push a bunch of snow out of the way. Even though it may not have
much friction with the roof, all that snow will slow it down, and reduce
the velocity with which it comes off. I'm just going to guess that about
half of the potential energy it had is lost to the snow and roof, as a
rough estimation. That would give a velocity $$|v| = \sqrt{gh}$$ and a
maximum distance of $$x= 4m = 13ft$$ which is closer to what I observed.
<strong>The Second Attempt</strong> I'm still not completely satisfied with the
previous work, the answer doesn't match my observation. As a wise man
(Einstein) once said, "make things as simple as possible, but no
simpler." I may be guilty of making the problem too simple here. So I'm
going to add back in air resistance. In general, we physicists like to
avoid this because it usually means we can't get nice, analytic
expressions as answers (like the one I have above). Instead, we usually
just have to calculate the result numerically. This isn't the end of the
world, and often times it is actually a bit easier, but it's not as
pretty looking. Still, to satisfy myself, and you, gentle reader, I will
step into that realm. We start by writing down the force on our block of
ice once it is falling. We've got gravity, and air resistance. Thus
$$\vec{F}=-mg\hat{y}-bv^2\hat{v}$$ I've input a drag force that goes
as v^2, and is in the opposite direction of v. The 'v direction' is a
cop out, because I didn't want to do the explicit direction, so lets fix
that. We'll have x and y components, and we note that the magnitude of v
times the direction of v is the velocity vector. So,
$$\vec{F}=-mg\hat{y}-bv\hat{v}_x-bv\hat{v}_y$$ Breaking this up
into components we get $$a_x=-\frac{bv}{m}v_x$$
$$a_y=-g-\frac{bv}{m}v_y$$ This is as far as we can take this work
analytically. I'll say a little more about the coefficient b. This
depends on the exact size and shape of the object, as well as the medium
it is moving through. I'm going to use $$b=.4\rho A$$ because that's
what we used for hay bales in my classical mechanics class years ago.
Here, rho is the density of air, and A is the surface area of the
object. I would estimate that the large face of the ice chunk is roughly
one square foot, or .1 m^2. I'd estimate the mass of the ice was around
2 kg. Now, for some magic. I've put all of this into mathematica, and
asked it to solve this numerically. First we have the plot for the full
initial velocity, $$v=\sqrt{2gh}$$</p>

  The solid line is with air resistance, the dashed line without air resistance. The plot shows vertical vs. horizontal distance, and the units are meters. (click to enlarge)</p>
<hr>
<p>As you can see from the plots, in neither case does it make a large
difference, about .2 m. <strong>The Third Round</strong> The final thought that
occurs to me is that perhaps I got the angle of the roof wrong. That
would be quite easy. Humans are notoriously bad at estimating angles.
I'll plot the results (with air resistance) for 15, 30, and 45 degree
angles and the lower velocity.</p>

  The plot shows vertical vs. horizontal distance, and the units are meters. The red line is 15 degrees, the blue line is 30 degrees, and the black line is 45 degrees. (click to enlarge)</p>
<hr>
<p>In summary, the answer is unclear. What I really need to do is measure
the angle of my roof better, because there's a significant angle
dependence. It's also quite possible that we didn't see a maximum
distance hit (thankfully!). In addition, air resistance doesn't seem to
matter much in this particular problem, probably because the distance
the thing falls is short enough that terminal velocity is not reached.
Hopefully this gave you a bit of a taste of a more practical physics
problem, and how to approach air resistance (if you want to see the
mathematica code, let me know). The lesson here seems to be either don't
park too close to roofs, or have insurance for your windshield!</p>

<p>Over break I went out with a buddy of mine and played some darts. This
got me to thinking, where exactly should someone aim in order to get the
largest expected number of points? Now, obviously when you are playing a
game like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_(darts)">Cricket</a>, where
you should aim is fairly obvious, you are trying to hit particular
numbers on the board, but in the most popular darts game
-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darts#Playing_darts">501</a>, for most of
the game you are just trying to accumulate points. So, where should you
shoot on the board to get the most points? Well, something that I didn't
quite realize before I started this adventure is that while the double
bullseye in the center is worth 50 points, the triple 20 is worth more:
60 points. For the uninitiated, in games like 501 you score points based
on where the dart falls. The center is the bullseye, where the inner
most circle is worth 50 and the ring around it is worth 25, after that
you score depending on which of the pie slice things you fall in, the
points being the number on the slice. The little ring around the outside
is worth double points, and the little ring at about half the board
radius is worth triple points. So perhaps the triple 20 is where you
should be aiming all the time. But you'll notice that to the left and
right of the 20 section are low numbers 1 and 5. So you might suspect
that if you can't throw all that accurately, you'll be paying a price
for shooting at the triple 20.</p>
<h4>The Model</h4>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TS9mjSvWVMI/AAAAAAAAAPk/Q3dKlgTH47M/s1600/dartsdistsig1p0.png"><img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TS9mjSvWVMI/AAAAAAAAAPk/Q3dKlgTH47M/s320/dartsdistsig1p0.png"></a></p>
<p>In order to answer a question like that, we need to develop a model for
dart throwing. In this case, I thought it was safe to assume that dart
throws are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">normally
distributed</a> about the
place you aim, with some sigma determined by your skill level. To the
left is an example of what normally-distributed dart throws look like
when the aim is at the center, and with a 1 inch standard deviation in
the throws. The dashed line marks a one inch ring to give a sense of how
scattered darts can be from 1 standard deviation.</p>
<h4>Results</h4>
<p>So, off I went, having drawn a dart board (to regulation) in Gimp, and
coloring each section in gray scale according to its point values, I
used python to perform all of the necessary computations (using
primarily the ndimage package in scipy). The result can be seen below.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TS9j9ivNItI/AAAAAAAAAPU/QtuSM7MZr48/s1600/dartscircleplusdot.png"><img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TS9j9ivNItI/AAAAAAAAAPU/QtuSM7MZr48/s400/dartscircleplusdot.png"></a></p>
<p>This image shows the optimal position on the board to aim for as a
function of how good of a player you are. The rings denote the sigmas,
and the dots the center point to aim for. The colorscale gives a
quantitative measure of the sigma, in inches. As you can see, the best
players should (and do according to youtube) aim for the triple 20,
since they are good enough to hit it most of the time, but once you're
throw is at about a 1 inch sigma, you should be aiming for the triple 19
in the bottom left. As you can see on the numbered board at the top, the
triple 19 is buffered on either side by the 3 and the 7, which are both
2 points above the 20 section's neighbors (1 and 5). So as you might
expect if you have a reasonable chance of hitting the sections to either
side, the triple 19 offers a higher expected score in the long run. The
other limit we can understand is the limit of really bad throws. If you
have a nontrivial chance of missing the board altogether, then obviously
you should just aim for the center of the board, in the hopes that you
at least hit the thing. But interestingly, in between the track that the
optimal aiming point takes is a little interesting. It tends to the
center (as we should expect), but it takes a curvy sort of root along
the bottom left quadrant of the board. Neat.</p>
<h4>Heat Maps</h4>
<p>In order to get a little better of a feel for why the track takes the
path it does, I decided to look at the heat maps for the expected score
at every location on the board for a set of given sigmas. So, in the
images below, the colors above the board indicate the relative score
expected if you aimed at that point.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TS9piZleQaI/AAAAAAAAAPs/xKR1XVK4oM0/s1600/darts-sig0p25flair.png"><img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TS9piZleQaI/AAAAAAAAAPs/xKR1XVK4oM0/s200/darts-sig0p25flair.png"></a></p>
<p>Above is for a quarter inch sigma throw [Click to zoom]. Notice that the
triple 20 is the place to hit, as expected.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TS9pwXSiutI/AAAAAAAAAP0/UW-U3zETxkU/s1600/darts-sig0p50flair.png"><img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TS9pwXSiutI/AAAAAAAAAP0/UW-U3zETxkU/s200/darts-sig0p50flair.png"></a></p>
<p>Above is a half inch sigma throw. The triple 20 is still in the lead,
but not by a whole lot. You can really see how if your aim is as good as
a half inch sigma, you can really still see the triple spots as true
features.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TS9qDpBCjOI/AAAAAAAAAP8/nnP8us-V3yU/s1600/darts-sig1p00flair.png"><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TS9qDpBCjOI/AAAAAAAAAP8/nnP8us-V3yU/s200/darts-sig1p00flair.png"></a></p>
<p>Above is a 1 inch sigma throw. Now the lower left hand quadrant has
taken over as the optimal place to throw. Notice that both the triple 16
and triple 19 make decent targets. The triple 14 also makes a showing,
due probably to its large neighbors.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TS9qf0GXLiI/AAAAAAAAAQE/64Jua-PBMtE/s1600/darts-sig1p50flair.png"><img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TS9qf0GXLiI/AAAAAAAAAQE/64Jua-PBMtE/s200/darts-sig1p50flair.png"></a></p>
<p>Above is a 1.5" sigma. The triple 20 is nearly gone as a place of
interest on the board, since we are no longer good enough to really
capitalize on it. The lower left hand portion of the board is the place
to be. We've really sort of lost any distinct features of the triple
spots, and now are just looking at quadrants of the board as a whole.
Our aim seems to tend to center a bit, as we are now in a little danger
of falling off the board.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TS9rAU2TGsI/AAAAAAAAAQM/uqIvzG_jqoE/s1600/darts-sig2p00flair.png"><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TS9rAU2TGsI/AAAAAAAAAQM/uqIvzG_jqoE/s200/darts-sig2p00flair.png"></a></p>
<p>At 2" sigma, we can really only hope to aim left-of-center.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TS9rLG9LRKI/AAAAAAAAAQU/1cz6YZer9Bs/s1600/darts-sig2p50flair.png"><img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TS9rLG9LRKI/AAAAAAAAAQU/1cz6YZer9Bs/s200/darts-sig2p50flair.png"></a></p>
<p>At 2.5" sigma, we really just want to hit the board.</p>
<h4>Lesson</h4>
<p>So, now I know, personally, I really just ought to aim just left of
center.</p>

Here we present the solution to the Holiday Code (original post
<a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/12/holiday-hidden-message.html">here</a>).
The content of the message is from the creepy looking gentleman to the
left, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. He is perhaps most famous for writing
the poem, "Paul Revere's Ride." I have taken another one of his popular
poems, "<a href="http://www.potw.org/archive/potw118.html">Christmas Bells</a>,"
and hidden its first verse in a huge mess of random letters. The
message: "I heard the bells on Christmas Day Their old, familiar carols
play, And wild and sweet The words repeat Of peace on earth, good-will
to men!" Sounds pretty pleasant at the start. But it was written at the
height of the Civil War and it gets pretty heavy towards the end.
Longfellow was an ardent abolitionist and most of his poems contain
allusions to the plight of slaves. He was also close friends with
Senator Charles Sumner, whose own fiery oratory and opposition to
slavery famously put him on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sumner#Antebellum_career_and_attack_by_Preston_Brooks">wrong
side</a>
of a Southern cane. So how do we go about divining the message above
from the mess of the original code? Well, the message is explicitly in
there, it's just hidden by a bunch of randomly generated letters. To get
the message out, one needs to know how the junk is distributed. To do
that we use the first hint. The first hint was a list of pie fillings.
So we will need to use pi to find out how the junk is filling the
message:

There are 3 junk letters before the first message letter, 1 before the
next, then 4, 1, 5, ... So the number of junk letters before a message
letter is given to you by pi. This

            </header><div class="e-content entry-content">
                    <p>Given a large set of data (bank accounts, river lengths, populations,
etc) what is the probability that the first non-zero digit is a one? My
first thought was that it would be 1/9. There are nine non-zero numbers
to choose from and they should be uniformly distributed, right? Turns
out that for almost all data sets naturally collected, this is not the
case. In most cases, one occurs as the first digit most frequently, then
two, then three, etc. That this seemingly paradoxical result should be
the case is the essence of Benford's Law. Benford's Law [1] states that
for most real-life lists of data, the first significant digit in the
data is distributed in a specific way, namely: $$ P(d) =
\mbox{log}<em>{10}\left(1 + \frac{1}{d}\right) $$ The probabilities
for leading digits are roughly P(1) = 0.30, P(2) = 0.18, P(3) = 0.12,
P(4) = 0.10, P(5) = 0.08, P(6) = 0.07, P(7) = 0.06, P(8) = 0.05, P(9) =
0.04. So we would expect the first significant digit to be a one almost
30% of the time! But where would such a distribution come from? Well, it
turns out that it comes from a distribution that is logarithmically
uniform. We can map the interval [1,10) to the interval [0,1) by just
taking a logarithm (base ten). These logarithms are then distributed
uniformly on the interval [0,1). We can now get some grasp for why one
should occur as the first digit more often in a uniform log
distribution. In the figure below, I have plotted 1-10 on a logarithm
scale. In a uniform log distribution, a given point is equally likely to
be found anywhere on the line. So the probability of getting any
particular first digit is just its length along that line. Clearly, the
intervals get smaller as the numbers get bigger.
<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TR4s91iaKKI/AAAAAAAAAIU/uxYE4eqknCY/s1600/logscale.png"><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TR4s91iaKKI/AAAAAAAAAIU/uxYE4eqknCY/s400/logscale.png"></a>
But we can quantify this, too. For a first digit on the interval [1,10),
the probability that the first digit is <em>d</em> is given by:
$$ P(d) = \frac{\mbox{log}</em>(d+1)
-\mbox{log}<em>{10}(d)}{\mbox{log}</em>(10) -\mbox{log}<em>{10}(1)} $$
which is just $$ P(d) =\mbox{log}</em>(d+1) -\mbox{log}<em>{10}(d) $$
or $$ P(d) = \mbox{log}</em>\left( 1 + \frac{1}{d} \right) $$ which
is the distribution of Benford's Law. So how well do different data sets
follow Benford's Law? I decided to test it out on a couple easily
available data sets: pulsar periods, U.S. city populations, U.S. county
sizes and masses of plant genomes. Let's start first with pulsar
periods. I took 1875 pulsar periods from the ATNF Pulsar Database (found
<a href="http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/psrcat/">here</a>). The results
are plotted below. The bars represent the fraction of numbers that start
with a given digit and the red dots are the fractions predicted by
Benford's Law.
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TRpObM6LxrI/AAAAAAAAAH8/tz9WQ98H258/s1600/benford_pulsar.png"><img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TRpObM6LxrI/AAAAAAAAAH8/tz9WQ98H258/s400/benford_pulsar.png"></a>
From this plot, we see that the pulsar period data shows the general
trend of Benford's Law, but not exactly. Now let's try U.S. city
populations. This data was taken from the U.S. census bureau from the
2009 census and contains population data for over 81,000 U.S. cities. We
see from the chart below that there is a near exact correspondence
between the observed first-digit distribution and Benford's Law.
<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TRpQhzrSFmI/AAAAAAAAAIA/ZP3YTbWiiM4/s1600/benford_uscities09.png"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TRpQhzrSFmI/AAAAAAAAAIA/ZP3YTbWiiM4/s400/benford_uscities09.png"></a>
Also from the U.S. census bureau, I got the data for the land area of
over 3000 U.S. counties. These data also conform fairly well to
Benford's Law.
<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TRpSE9pHC1I/AAAAAAAAAII/dqG382dqoCw/s1600/benford_land.png"><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TRpSE9pHC1I/AAAAAAAAAII/dqG382dqoCw/s400/benford_land.png"></a>
Finally, I found
<a href="http://data.kew.org/cvalues/CvalServlet?querytype=1">this</a> neat website
that catalogs the genome masses of over 2000 different species of
plants. I'm not totally sure <em>why</em> they do this, but it provided a ton
of easy-to-access data, so why not?
<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TRpR82I2X1I/AAAAAAAAAIE/XdFQozbC7eY/s1600/benford_plant.png"><img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TRpR82I2X1I/AAAAAAAAAIE/XdFQozbC7eY/s400/benford_plant.png"></a>
Neat, so we see that wide variety of natural data follow Benford's Law
(some more examples
<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BenfordsLaw.html">here</a>). But why should
they? Well, as far as I have gathered, there are a few reasons for this.
The first two come from a paper published by Jeff Boyle [2]. Boyle makes
(and proves) two claims about this distribution. First, he claims that
"the log distribution [Benford's Law] is the limiting distribution when
random variables are repeatedly multiplied, divided, or raised to
integer powers." Second, he claims that once such a distribution is
achieved, it "persists under all further multiplications, divisions and
raising to integer powers." Since most data we accumulate (scientific,
financial, gambling,...) is the result of many mathematical operations,
we would expect that they would tend towards the logarithmic
distribution as described by Boyle. Another reason for why natural data
should fit Benford's Law is given by Roger Pinkham (in <a href="http://www.williams.edu/go/math/sjmiller/public_html/BrownClasses/197/benford/Pinkham_FirstDigit.pdf">this
paper</a>).
Pinkham proves that<em>"</em>the only distribution for the first significant
digits which is invariant under scale change of the underlying
distribution" is Benford's Law. This means that if we have some data,
say the lengths of rivers in feet, it will have some distribution in the
first digit. If we require that this distribution remain the same under
unit conversion (to meters, yards, cubits, ... ), the only distribution
that satisfies this distribution would be the uniform logarithmic
distribution of Benford's Law. This "scale-invariant" rationale for this
first digit law is probably the most important when it comes to data
that we actually measure. If we find some distribution for the first
digit, we would like it to be the same no matter what units we have
used. But this should also be really easy to test. The county size data
used above was given in square miles, so let's try some new units.
First, we can try square kilometers.
<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TR09Vq1jCAI/AAAAAAAAAIM/1Yz5gp0-7CY/s1600/benford_landkm.png"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TR09Vq1jCAI/AAAAAAAAAIM/1Yz5gp0-7CY/s400/benford_landkm.png"></a>
Slightly different than square miles, but still a very good fit. Now how
about square furlongs?
<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TR093IwIt8I/AAAAAAAAAIQ/ern61I_MJQ0/s1600/benford_landfurlong.png"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TR093IwIt8I/AAAAAAAAAIQ/ern61I_MJQ0/s400/benford_landfurlong.png"></a>
Neat! Seems like the distribution holds true regardless of the units we
have used. So it seems like a wide range of data satisfy Benford's Law.
But is this useful in any way or is it just a statistical curiosity?
Well, it's mainly just a curiosity. But people have found some pretty
neat applications. One field in which it has found use is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_accounting">Forensic
Accounting</a>, which I
can only assume is a totally rad bunch of accountants that dramatically
remove sunglasses as they go over tax returns. Since certain types of
financial data (for example, see
<a href="http://www.uic.edu/classes/actg/actg593/Readings/Auditing/The-Effective-Use-Of-Benford's-Law-To-Assist-In-Detecting-Fraud-In-Accounting-Data.pdf">here</a>)
should follow Benford's Law, inconsistencies in financial returns can be
found if the data is faked or manipulated in any way. Moral of the
story: If you're going to cook the books, remember Benford! [1]
Benford's Law, in the great tradition of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigler's_law_of_eponymy">Stigler's
Law,</a> was
discovered by Simon Newcomb. [2] Paper can be found
<a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/2975136">here</a>. Unfortunately, this is only a
preview as the full version isn't publicly available without a library
license. The two points that I use from this paper are at least stated
in this preview.</p>

<p>Greetings and happy holidays! Everyone has gone home for the break, so
we will be taking a break from the grossly misnamed "Problem of the
Week" for a while. Instead, here's a "Christmas Code" I made up for a
friend. Figure it out and win the respect of strangers on the Internet!
Largely unhelpful hints after the break.

  Figure 1: Two of the thousands of toothpicks on my floor</p>
<hr>
<p>You're sitting at a bar, bored out of your mind. You've got an unlimited
supply of pretzel rods and a lot of time to kill. The floor is made of
thin wooden planks. How can you calculate pi? This is how the problem of
Buffon's needle was first presented to me. Stated more formally the
problem is this: given a needle of length <em>l</em> and a floor of parallel
lines separated by a distance <em>d</em>, what is the probability of a randomly
dropped needle crossing a line? Working this all out (see a derivation
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffon's_needle">here</a>, for example), we
find that the probability a needle crosses a line is $$ P =
\frac{2l}{d\pi} $$ So now we have a nice way of experimentally coming
up with a value for pi. Simply by tossing a bunch of needles of length
<em>l</em> on a striped surface with lines separated by a distance <em>d</em> and
counting the total number of times a needle crosses a line and the total
number of throws, we can approximate the probability (and thus, pi). I
say "approximate" because it will only be true in the limit of an
infinite number of throws. Anyway, we have that $$ \frac{\mbox{Number
of crosses}}{\mbox{Number of throws}} \approx P = \frac{2l}{\pi d}
$$ so, rearranging a bit, we have that $$ \pi \approx \left(
\frac{2l}{d} \right) \left(\frac{\mbox{Number of
throws}}{\mbox{Number of crosses}} \right) $$ Now we have something
that we can go about measuring. I am going to define the following value
to be the experimental quantity we aim to measure: $$ \tilde{\pi} =
\left( \frac{2l}{d} \right) \left(\frac{\mbox{Number of
throws}}{\mbox{Number of crosses}} \right) $$ So now that we know what
we are measuring, let's get to it! Since I'm not allowed to use needles
in my home experiments anymore, I decided to use toothpicks. For my
striped surface, I just used the wooden floor in our house (see Figure
1). The toothpick length was almost exactly the same as the distance
between lines on the floor, so we see that that the <em>l</em>and <em>d</em> terms
cancel in our expression above. To make the measurements, I threw ten
toothpicks at a time onto the floor and counted how many crossed the
lines. I chose ten because it seemed like a nice number. It was small
enough that I shouldn't expect too much clumping of the toothpicks (and
unwanted correlations in the data), but large enough that I didn't have
to drop and pick up a single toothpick a thousand times. I threw the
groups of ten toothpicks 100 times and tallied the results. Thus, I have
1000 throws of a single needle. It took the entirety the movie
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undercover_Brother">Undercover Brother</a> to
throw and pick up all those toothpicks, but when all was said and done I
found that out of 1000 thrown toothpicks, 618 crossed the line. Plugging
this back into our equation above (and remembering <em>l</em> = <em>d</em>), we get $$
\tilde{\pi}=\left(\frac{2l}{d}\right) \left(\frac{\mbox{Number
of throws}}{\mbox{Number of crosses}} \right)=2
\left(\frac{1000}{618}\right)=3.23$$ Well that's not too far off I
guess. But it's certainly not the pi that I know and love. What went
wrong? As I mentioned before, since I am only doing a finite number of
runs here I am not finding the exact probability. So is there anyway to
gauge our uncertainty? Sure. Since we are doing a counting experiment
with a lot of events, we can approximate our error using Poisson
statistics. For a Poisson distribution, the standard deviation is just
the square root of the number of events (in this case, crosses). So we
have that our total number of crosses is $$ \mbox{Number of crosses} =
618 \pm \sqrt{618} = 618 \pm 24.9 $$ So now if we want to find the
uncertainty in our final measurement, we'll have to propagate the error
through. This gives us a final value of $$ \tilde{\pi} = 3.23 \pm
0.13 $$ and we see that the exact value of pi falls within there. We can
see that this value gets better and better if we plot our value of pi as
a function of the number of throws. Figure 2 shows the measured value of
pi (with error bars) over a wide range of throw numbers. The actual
value of pi is plotted as a green line.</p>

<p>So we see that the more toothpicks we drop, the closer and closer we get
to pi. Hot dog! Certainly an evening well spent.</p>
