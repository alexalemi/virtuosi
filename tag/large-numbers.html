</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>I hate politics, but for some reason I obsessively read about it.  I don't know why I do this, but I assume it's the same reason people slow down for car wrecks and pay to see the geek [1].  Anyway, the big thing in political news now is that if Congress can't pass a budget [2] by the end of the day Friday, the government will shut down. </p>
<p>Shutting down the government means that 800,000 federal employees will go without pay [3], lots of services will be put on hold and you won't be able to go to the Smithsonian or the Grand Canyon.  So it's kind of a big deal.  Since the ramifications of a government shutdown are so serious, there must be some really important disagreements holding it up, right?  Right?</p>
<p>A quick search (for example, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/07/us-congress-staff-government-shutdown">here</a>), shows that the big hold-up in passing the budget comes over a disagreement on how much money should be cut from the budget.  Republicans want to cut <mathjax>$40 billion dollars and Democrats are willing to cut $</mathjax>34.5 billion dollars. </p>
<p>So the hold-up is over $5.5 billion.  Let's consider how utterly and stupidly insignificant this is.
<a name='more'></a>
We shall take as our inspiration Alemi's <a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/12/law-and-large-numbers.html">post</a> a while back offering several ways to help visualize the large and scary sounding numbers thrown around in government budgets.</p>
<p>The first thing we'd like to do is find out what fraction this <mathjax>$5.5 billion discrepancy is compared to the total budget.  Alemi cites the total budget of the U.S. government in the 2010 fiscal year to be $</mathjax>3.55 trillion.  Hot dog!  So we see that:</p>
<p><mathjax>$$ \frac{\mbox{Disputed Difference}}{\mbox{Total Budget}} = \frac{\$5.5 \times 10^9}{\$3.55 \times 10^{12}} = 0.0015 $$</mathjax></p>
<p>So the disputed part amounts to 0.15% of the total budget or one and half parts in a thousand.  Let's compare this to some things for which we have a better sense of scale. </p>
<p>Let's pretend we are looking to buy a car.  We need it to get to work and, you know, get stuff done.  If our car costs $10,000 dollars then 0.15% of our total costs will be</p>
<p><mathjax>$$ \mbox{\$10,000} \times 0.0015 = \$15 $$</mathjax></p>
<p>So the current budget situation is like arguing for 6 months over a <mathjax>$15 charge on your $</mathjax>10,000 car.  Sounds reasonable!</p>
<p>Now let's switch gears and consider a timescale.  Let's consider a 40 hour work week.  What's 0.15% of 40 hours?  This comes to</p>
<p><mathjax>$$ 40 \mbox{ hr} \times 0.0015 = 0.06 \mbox{ hr} $$</mathjax></p>
<p>or, if you prefer,</p>
<p><mathjax>$$ 0.06 \mbox{ hr} \times \frac{60 \mbox{ min}}{1 \mbox{ hr}} = 3.6 \mbox{ minutes} $$</mathjax> </p>
<p>So the current budget problem is like arguing for six months over about three and a half extra minutes to your work week.</p>
<p>Now let's consider a length scale.  Consider the US $1 bill.  According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_one-dollar_bill#Small_size_notes">Wikipedia</a>, the dollar bill is 6.14 inches long, 2.61 inches wide and 0.0043 inches thick.  That means that the ratio of the thickness to the width of a dollar bill is</p>
<p><mathjax>$$ \frac{\mbox{Thickness}}{\mbox{Width}} = \frac{0.0043 \mbox{ inches}}{2.61 \mbox{ inches}} = 0.0016 $$</mathjax></p>
<p>or slightly <i>more</i> than the disputed fraction of the budget.  Hooray!</p>
<p>"That's all well and nice," you say, lowering your voice and leaning over in a way that makes me uncomfortable, "but who is to <i>blame</i>?"</p>
<p>That's a great question!  My answer will take the form of an experiment. </p>
<p>First, get a coin.  Got it?  Great.  Now if you're Republican, let heads be "The Republicans" and tails be "The Democrats."  If you're a Democrat, let heads be "The Democrats" and tails be "The Republicans."  If you are neither, then randomly assign a party to heads and allow the other to be tails.</p>
<p>Ready?</p>
<p>The coin is to blame.</p>
<p>[1]  I use this in its original meaning.  That is, the guy whose job it was to do horribly gross things at a carnival for money, not the guy whose main form of social interaction is debating scenes in Star Wars on internet forums.  A more up-to-date comparison would have been to say "for the same reason that people watch <i>Jersey Shore</i>."</p>
<p>[2]  That is, the budget for the 2011 fiscal year, which started on October 1st 2010. </p>
<p>[3]  Don't worry, all members of Congress would be exempt from this and would still pick up paychecks!</p><p>There are <a href="../posts/a-sense-of-scale-in-dollars-and-cents-.html#disqus_thread">comments</a>.</p>                </article>
