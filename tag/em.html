</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>There were some undergrads in my office for office hours the other day, asking questions for the  midterm. I'm teaching  the engineering course on optics and waves (also known as <span style="font-style: italic;">Things that go Sine</span>) and the students were looking at a problem dealing with  quarter-wave plates.<br /><br />A quarter-wave plate, the question goes, is a kind of optical  instrument that turns light with linear polarization into circular polarization. Show, it continues, that it also turns light with circular polarization linear.<br /><br />After a minute or two of discussing how a quarter-wave plate work ("what, does it act  differently on different <span style="font-style: italic;">axes</span>?" giggled one, and everybody gasped when I said yes) we went to the math. I wrote down the equations for light with linear and circular polarization,<br /><br />[ E_0 \hat{x} \cos\left(kz-\omega t\right) \to \frac{E_0}{\sqrt{2}}\hat{x}\cos\left(kz-\omega t\right) + \frac{E_0}{\sqrt{2}}\hat{y}\sin\left(kz-\omega t\right) ]<br /><br />with a little arrow in between them to signify that the quarter-wave plate turns one into the other.<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br />This was acceptable, so we continued. What happens when light with circular polarization enters the plate? Well, we start out the other way:<br />[\frac{E_0}{\sqrt{2}}\hat{x}\cos\left(kz-\omega t\right) +  \frac{E_0}{\sqrt{2}}\hat{y}\sin\left(kz-\omega t\right) ]<br />and then break it up into components. The first term obviously behaves exactly the same as in the previous case,<br />[\frac{E_0}{\sqrt{2}}\hat{x}\cos\left(kz-\omega t\right) \to \frac{E_0}{2}\hat{x}\cos\left(kz-\omega t\right) +  \frac{E_0}{2}\hat{y}\sin\left(kz-\omega t\right) ]<br />while the second term is easy to extrapolate from there,<br />[\frac{E_0}{\sqrt{2}}\hat{y}\sin\left(kz-\omega t\right) \to -\frac{E_0}{2}\hat{x}\cos\left(kz-\omega t\right) +  \frac{E_0}{2}\hat{y}\sin\left(kz-\omega t\right) ]<br />and adding them both up, we get on the other side of the quarter-wave plate<br />[E_0\hat{y}\sin\left(kz-\omega t\right)]<br />a linearly polarized wave.<br /><br />Simple, right?<br /><br />Almost simple. There's one trick in there, which you may have noticed if you were following. My student noticed it - but she's a clever one - and she asked me why I put that minus sign in the second transformation equation. And my honest answer was that I put it there to get the result I wanted.<br /><br />Sure, I can back it up with more math (handedness, or maybe I can figure it out by redrawing the axes) but when I was writing those equations on the board, I put that minus sign there because I was expecting a certain result.<br /><br />And really, we do this all the time. The math isn't neutral; it's an ally (or an enemy, sometimes) that we're bending to get the result we want - because of intuition, because of a previous results, because this is a homework problem with a known solution - or because we have an experimental result that we really want to be in accord with.<br /><br />This isn't a problem, necessarily. Sometimes it leads us to wrong results, sometimes it helps us reach the correct ones. It usually makes our life easier, and sometimes makes them a lot harder. Keeping this bias in mind when we do our math should hopefully lead to more of the first and less of the second.</p>                </article>
