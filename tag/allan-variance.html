<p>A couple of months ago, the Virtuosi Action Team (VAT) assembled for lunch and the discussion quickly and unexpectedly turned to watches. &nbsp;As Nic and Alemi argued over the finer parts of fancy-dancy watch ownership, I looked down at my watch: &nbsp;the lowly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_F91W">Casio F-91W</a>. &nbsp;Though it certainly isn't fancy, it is inexpensive, durable, and could potentially win me an all-expense paid trip to the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/25/guantanamo-files-casio-wristwatch-alqaida">Caribbean</a>. <br /><div><br /></div><div>But how <i>good</i>&nbsp;of a watch is it? &nbsp;To find out, I decided to time it against the official U.S. time for a couple of months. &nbsp;Incidentally, about half-way in I found out that Chad over at <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/principles/">Uncertain Principles</a> had done essentially the same thing <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2011/05/the_testing_of_time_measuring.php">already</a>. &nbsp;No matter, science is still fun even if you aren't the first person to do it. &nbsp;So here's my "new-to-me" analysis.<br /><br /><a name='more'></a>Alright, so how do we go about quantifying how "good" a watch is? &nbsp;Well, there seem to be two main things we can test. &nbsp;The first of these is accuracy. &nbsp;That is, how close does this watch come to the <i>actual</i>&nbsp;time (according to some time system)? &nbsp;If the official time is 3:00 pm and my watch claims it is 5:00 am, then it is not very accurate. &nbsp;The second measure of "good-ness" is precision or, in watch parlance, stability. &nbsp;This is essentially a measure of the consistency of the watch. &nbsp;If I have a watch that is consistently off by 5 minutes from the official time, then it is not accurate but it is still stable. &nbsp;In essence, a very consistent watch would be just as good as an accurate one, because we can always just subtract off the known offset.<br /><br />To test any of the above measures of how "good" my cheap watch is, we will need to know the actual time. &nbsp;We will adopt the official U.S. time as provided on the <a href="http://nist.time.gov/timezone.cgi?Eastern/d/-5/java">NIST website</a>. &nbsp;This time is determined and maintained by a collection of really impressive atomic clocks. &nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST-F1">One of these</a>&nbsp;is in Colorado and the other is secretly guarded by an ever-vigilant Time Lord (see Figure 1). <br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EXMf5o9a4GI/TzCRcaMjjVI/AAAAAAAAASs/FlqyjHbJS9Q/s1600/flavor_flav.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EXMf5o9a4GI/TzCRcaMjjVI/AAAAAAAAASs/FlqyjHbJS9Q/s320/flavor_flav.jpg" width="290" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Figure 1: &nbsp;Flavor Flav, Keeper of the Time</td></tr></tbody></table>At 9:00:00 am EST on November 30th, I synchronized my watch with the time displayed on the NIST website. &nbsp;For the next 54 days, I kept track of the difference between my watch an the NIST time. &nbsp;On the 55th day, I forgot to check the time and the experiment promptly ended. &nbsp;The results are plotted below in Figure 2 (and, as with all plots, click through for a larger version).<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hscjUIehrHQ/TzCYqNhcsYI/AAAAAAAAATE/eAz3O5KlAcY/s1600/time_fit_short.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hscjUIehrHQ/TzCYqNhcsYI/AAAAAAAAATE/eAz3O5KlAcY/s400/time_fit_short.png" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Figure 2: Best-fit to time difference</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span></div>As you can see from Figure 2, the amount of time the watch lost over the timing period appears to be fairly linear. &nbsp;There does appear to be a jagged-ness to the data, though. &nbsp;This is mainly caused by the fact that both the watch and the NIST website only report times to the nearest second. &nbsp;As a result, the finest time resolution I was willing to report was about half a second.<br /><br />Adopting an uncertainty of half a second, I did a least-squares fit of a straight line to the data and found that the watch loses about 0.35 seconds per day.<br /><br />As far as accuracy goes, that's not bad! &nbsp;No matter what, I'll have to set my watch at least twice a year to appease the Daylight Savings Gods. &nbsp;The longest stretch between resetting is about 8 months. &nbsp;If I synchronize my watch with the NIST time to "spring forward" in March, it will only lose about<br /><br />[ t_{loss} = 8~\mbox{months} \times 30\frac{\mbox{days}}{\mbox{month}} \times 0.35 \frac{\mbox{sec}}{\mbox{day}} = 84~\mbox{sec} ]<br /><br />before I have to re-synchronize to "fall back" in November. &nbsp;Assuming the loss rate is constant, I'll never be more than about a minute and a half off the "actual" time. &nbsp;That's good enough for me.<br /><br />Furthermore, if the watch is <i>consistently</i>&nbsp;losing 0.35 seconds per day and I know how long ago I last synchronized, I can always correct for the offset. &nbsp;In this case, I can always know the official time to within a second (assuming I can add).<br /><br />But <i>is</i>&nbsp;the watch consistent? &nbsp;That's a good question. &nbsp;The simplest means of finding the stability of the watch would be to look at the timing residuals between the data and the model. &nbsp;That is, we will consider how "off" each point is from our constant rate-loss model. &nbsp;A plot of the results is shown below in Figure 3.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-13ULtvOlXuU/TzCpp6LGvfI/AAAAAAAAATM/8rybD1lxZOo/s1600/residuals.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-13ULtvOlXuU/TzCpp6LGvfI/AAAAAAAAATM/8rybD1lxZOo/s400/residuals.png" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Figure 3: Timing residuals</td></tr></tbody></table>From Figure 3, we see that the data fit the model pretty well. &nbsp;There's a little bit of a wiggle going on there and we see some strong short-term correlations (the latter is an artifact of the fact that I could only get times to the nearest second). <br /><br />To get some sense of the timing stability from the residuals, we can calculate the standard deviation, which will give us a figure for how "off" the data typically are from the model. &nbsp;The standard deviation of the residuals is<br /><br />[ \sigma_{res} = 0.19~\mbox{sec}. ]<br /><br />A good guess at the fractional stability of the watch would then just be the standard deviation divided by the sampling interval,<br /><br />[ \frac{\sigma_{res}}{T} = 0.19~\mbox{sec} \times \frac{1}{1~\mbox{day}} \times \frac{1~\mbox{day}}{24\times3600~\mbox{sec}} \approx 2\times10^{-6}.]<br /><br />In words, this means that each "tick" of the watch is consistent with the average "tick" value to about 2 parts in a million. <br /><br />That's nice...but isn't there something <i>fancier</i>&nbsp;we could be doing? &nbsp;Well, I have been wanting to learn about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_variance">Allan variance</a> for some time now, so let's try that. <br /><br />The Allan variance (refs: <a href="http://www.ino.it/~azavatta/References/Allan.pdf">original paper</a> and a <a href="http://tf.boulder.nist.gov/general/pdf/118.pdf">review</a>) can be used to find the fractional frequency stability of an oscillator over a wide range of time scales. &nbsp;Roughly speaking, the Allan variance tells us how averaging our residuals over different chunks of time affects the stability of our data. &nbsp;The square root of the Allan variance, essentially the "Allan standard deviation," is plotted against various averaging times for our data below in Figure 4.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_zhCroHDoNE/TzC7XYkDZ1I/AAAAAAAAATU/mCaspxYhlxA/s1600/allan_variance.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_zhCroHDoNE/TzC7XYkDZ1I/AAAAAAAAATU/mCaspxYhlxA/s400/allan_variance.png" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Figure 4: &nbsp;Allan variance of our residuals</td></tr></tbody></table>From Figure 4, we see that as we increase the averaging time from one day to ten days, the Allan deviation decreases. &nbsp;That is, the averaging reduces the amount of variation in the frequency of the data, making it more stable. &nbsp;However, at around 10 days of averaging time it seems as though we hit a floor in how low we can go. &nbsp;Since the error bars get really big here, this may not be a real effect. &nbsp;If it is real, though, this would be indicative of some low-frequency noise in our oscillator. &nbsp;For those who prefer colors, this would be "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colors_of_noise">red</a>" noise.<br /><br />Since the Allan deviation gives the fractional frequency stability of the oscillator, we have that<br /><br />[\sigma_A = \frac{\delta f}{f} = \frac{\delta(1/t)}{1/t} = \frac{\delta t}{t}. ]<br /><br />Looking at the plot, we see that with an averaging time of one day, the fractional time stability of the watch is<br /><br />[\frac{\delta t}{t} \approx 2\times10^{-6}, ]<br /><br />which corresponds nicely to our previously calculated value. &nbsp;If we average over chunks that are ten days long instead, we get a fractional stability of<br /><br />[\frac{\delta t}{t} \approx 10^{-7}, ]<br /><br />which would correspond to a deviation from our model of about 0.008 seconds. &nbsp;Not bad.<br /><br />The initial question that started this whole ordeal was "How good is my watch?" and I think we can safely answer that with "as good as I'll ever need it to be." &nbsp;Hooray for cheap and effective electronics!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></p><p>There are <a href="../posts/time-keeps-on-slippin-.html#disqus_thread">comments</a>.</p>                </article>
