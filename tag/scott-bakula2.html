                <div class="summary">The bearded half of Hulse-Taylor A few weeks ago I was on a bus going through Scranton and I read a super-awesome fun fact regarding the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar in Black Holes, White Dwarfs and Neutron Stars. Sadly, I have since forgotten it and left the book a few thousand miles away. So, let's just make up our own! First, we need a little background. What the heck is a pulsar? A pulsar is a rapidly rotating neutron star that beams electromagnetic radiation towards us, which is how we can see them. Typical rotation periods range from a millisecond to a few seconds. So each time the pulsar rotates, we observe a blip when the radiation beams towards us. Since these objects are additionally very stable rotators, they are essentially very accurate clocks with which we may make astronomical measurements. So what's the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar? The Hulse-Taylor ...

It appears to be some sort of screen play, though one would be hard-pressed to figure this out solely from the script. The true giveaway was the 100 page addendum (not published) full of potential titles and acceptance speeches. I dare not bore you with these vanity pages in their entirety, but just for completeness and posterity I include some samples. For possible titles we have: "Dr. Dre, OR: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Metric," "How to Teach Physics to your Dee Oh Double G (West Coast Edition)," "Bring Da Ruckus: ODEs by ODB" and "Flavor Flav's Flavor Physics...boooyeeeee!" among other even worse and less relevant titles.

                <div class="summary">Matt and Jared standing on our experiment When you strike a bell, it rings at a given frequency. This frequency is called the resonant frequency and is the natural frequency at which the bell likes to ring. Just about anything that can shake, rattle, or oscillate will have a resonant frequency. Things like quartz crystals, wine glasses, and suspension bridges all have a resonant frequency. The quartz crystals oscillate at frequencies high enough for accurate timekeeping in watches, the wine glasses at audible frequencies to make boring dinners more interesting, and bridges at low enough frequencies that you can feel it when you walk. It is the resonant frequency of bridges that we decided to measure. To make our measurements, we "borrowed" Yariv's fancy phone. One of the nice things about fancy new phones is that most of them have internal accelerometers to detect motion. You can do a ...

                <div class="summary">Every once in a while, in the study of science, one comes across biographical snippets that momentarily breathe life into names that otherwise serve as shorthand for equations and eras. As an obvious effect of the selection bias involved with including this superfluous information in technical books, they are bound to be pretty interesting. Such stories range from the hilarious antics of Feynman [1] or Fermi [2], to the heartbreaking stories of Boltzmann and Oppenheimer, and even to the surprisingly scandalous life of Erwin Schrödinger. But my all time favorite of all these historical "fun facts" is that of the man who provided the first exact solution to the Einstein field equations while fighting in the First World War: Karl Schwarzschild (pictured left impersonating a surprised walrus [3]). Karl Schwarzschild was an astronomer, physicist and mathematician; an across the board physical scientist with passions both abstract and practical. He ...

Over the course of two semesters Alemi and I have deposited roughly the equivalent of the GDP of, say, Monaco to this very same Pepsi machine (see left, with most of Landau and Lifshitz to scale). It just so happens that Pepsi is now having a contest, called "Caps for Caps," in which it is possible to win a baseball hat. There are several nice things about this contest. Firstly, I drink a lot of soda. Secondly, I like baseball hats. So far so good. Lastly (and most important for this post), is that it is fairly straightforward to calculate the statistics of winning (or at least simulate them). So how does the game work? Well, on each soda cap the name of a Major League Baseball team is printed. All thirty teams are (supposedly) printed with the same frequency ...

                <div class="summary">I was outside talking with Alemi last week and we were both startled to realize that the frozen white tundras of Ithaca had somehow transformed into fields of green. Apparently the snow was a temporary fixture that covered real live grass. Neato, gang! The joy at seeing green grass led quickly to surprise, confusion and then anger. Why the heck is grass green? Well, things look a color when they reflect back that color. So grass is green because its pigments (chlorophyll) absorb only a certain range of the visible spectrum, reflecting back the greenish bits. But if I know anything about approximating the sun as a blackbody, I know that it has a peak output of around 550 nm (i.e. green) light. So what's going on? Why are plants blatantly rejecting the most abundant kind of light? Since my initial confusion rested on the assumption of the ...

                <div class="summary">One thing that I've wanted to quantify since reading Intelligent Life in the Universe, an outstanding book by Carl Sagan and I.S. Shklovskii, is the idea of exogenesis. Exogenesis is the hypothesis that life formed elsewhere in the universe and was somehow transferred to earth in the form of some small seed or spore. Now since E.T. E. coli presumably do not have little tiny jetpacks or other means of active transport, they would need to traverse the cosmos in some passive way. One such way would be solar sailing. Way back in Solar Sails I, we derived equations describing the maximum speeds and time-of-travel for various distances for a given solar sail. Each of these equations was a function of the surface mass density of the sail, which is just the amount of mass per unit cross-sectional area. All we need to know is the cross-sectional ...

It's got the LHC, black holes, and about 3 full cups of metric awesome, so make sure you check it out (after reading this one, of course).] Last time we did some calculations on how fast and far our solar sails can go, but those calculations were just for the sail itself. If you are going to do any science with it, you're going to need a payload. Let's take it a step further and make it an actual spaceship (with people and everything!). Comparing it with a typical people-carrying space hotel (the International Space Station), let's give our payload a mass of 300,000 kg.

                <div class="summary">Solar sails are in the news again, and this time not just for blowing up. The Japanese space agency is launching what they hope to be the first successful solar sail tomorrow. In honor of that, we will be discussing the physics of solar sails. First of all, what the heck are solar sails? Solar sails are a means of propulsion based on the simple observation that "Hey, sails work on boats. Therefore, they should work on interplanetary spacecraft (in space)." Boat sails work when air molecules hit into the sail and bounce back. By conservation of momentum, this gives the boat sail an itty bitty boost in momentum. Summing over the large number of air molecules moving as wind, the boat gets pushed along in the water. A similar process works with solar sails, but instead of air molecules doing the hitting, it's photons. Since each photon of ...

                <div class="summary">No day of earth destroying celebration would be complete without that apocalyptic all-time favorite: the asteroid. And to be fair, it deserves to be the favorite. Of all the doomsday predictions out there (nuclear holocaust for the cynics, death by snoo-snoo for the optimists) it is the only one that is just about certain to occur at some point in the geological near future. On top of that, it's one that we could potentially avoid with enough time and some neat ideas . Let's model an asteroid impact on the earth. We will assume an asteroid starting from rest at infinity and falling to the surface of the earth due to earth's gravity only. Now obviously these assumptions are not exactly correct. We can imagine our asteroid not starting from rest or feeling some force due to the sun. Each of these would certainly change our answer, but ...

                <div class="summary">I was reading the Wikipedia page for the Hitchhiker's Guide books the other day and found that it started as a series of radio shows called "The Ends of Earth." At the end of each episode, the Earth would be destroyed. Since I feel like this is the best way to end any TV show/movie/book/news broadcast/Mayan calendar, I will shamelessly steal the idea. Since this is the first End of the Earth post, we will start small and just consider the boiling off of all the world's oceans. To be precise, we will consider how much energy it would take to turn all the world's water at 0 degrees Celsius to water vapor at 100 degrees Celsius. First we need to estimate the mass of all the water on earth. I will make the assumptions that all water is fresh water and that ...

                <div class="summary">The other day I was on my way through ye olde internets to the Quantum Leap episode index at Wikipedia, but stumbled over a quote by Feynman by accident: "There are 10^11 stars in the galaxy. That used to be a huge number. But it's only a hundred billion. It's less than the national deficit! We used to call them astronomical numbers. Now we should call them economical numbers" So this got me thinking. What if we decided to pay the national debt...in pennies? Seems fair enough, we don't really want to pay it and when you don't want to pay something but you have to you pay it in pennies. Hooray! Last I heard this figure was somewhere around $10,000,000,000,000 (ten trillion), that is:</div><div> </div><div>$$ \text{Debt} = 10^{13} \text{dollars} = 10^{15} \text{pennies} $$</div ...

                <div class="summary">For posterity, completeness and another superfluous Scott Bakula reference I present the following. It is an expression, through the majesty of song (rap), of our love for all things quantum and undead ( or perhaps a superposition of dead/ not dead states...? ). We all know that the great physicist Paul Dirac, was not a vampire. What this rap presupposes is... maybe he was? If so, he would almost certainly be named Diracula. He would be especially good at physics. But he would especially be totally rad at rapping. Without further ado, the Diracula Rapula: Yo, its Diracula and I got something to say Better listen close cause sometimes my teeth get in the way. Of my rappin', but never my mathin' Gonna work it strong, gonna make these monopoles happen. Regardless of how you feel about me and my strings with length semi-infinityRespect my proclamation cause you find just one ...
