</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Yesterday I considered how long it would take a human to <a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/05/freezing-in-space-i-blackest-night.html">freeze in space</a>. &nbsp;However, I considered only what would happen if you were not absorbing any radiation from nearby sources. &nbsp;Today we consider what happens if you do have hot objects nearby. &nbsp;Namely, the sun. &nbsp;The sun provides a lot of energy, even as far away from it as we are. &nbsp;It keeps the earth at a comfortable ~20 C, good for us humans, and provides the energy for life on earth, also good for us humans. &nbsp;That's a lot of energy. &nbsp;So maybe the sun can keep you alive when you're adrift in space. &nbsp;Or at least keep you warm. &nbsp;I still think you'll asphyxiate.<br /><br /><a name='more'></a>From here on out we're going to assume that we are adrift in space near earth. &nbsp;You were out for a joyride in that new spaceship of yours and something went horribly wrong. &nbsp;We could go through a whole song and dance of calculating how much power the sun delivers to the earth, but we won't (if you're interested, let me know, an I can do that later). &nbsp;Instead, we'll quote the known result, that the sun delivers ~1370W/m^2 in the vicinity of the earth. &nbsp;To find out what temperature we would cool to we set the power we absorb from the sun equal to the power we radiate<br />[P_{sun}=P_{rad}]<br />[1370W/m^2<em>A_{ab}</em>e_{ab}=e_{rad}<em>A_{rad}</em>\sigma<em>T^4]<br />Where A_ab is the surface area absorbing the suns power, e_ab is a factor between 0 and 1 that indicates how much of the incident power we actually absorb, and e_rad is the emissivity of us, while A_rad is our radiating area. &nbsp;Note that the emitting and absorbing areas are not the same! &nbsp;Take a simple example. &nbsp;If you put a sheet in space, and face the flat side towards the sun, it will only absorb energy from the sun on one side, but it will radiate energy from both sides. &nbsp;Likewise e_ab and e_rad are not necessarily equal because we are radiating and absorbing at different wavelengths.<br /><br />We can solve the above equation for T, giving<br />[T=\left(\frac{A_{ab}}{A_{rad}}\right)^{1/4}\left(\frac{e_{ab}}{e_{rad}}\right)^{1/4}\left(\frac{1370W/m^2}{\sigma}\right)^{1/4}]<br />For a first pass, we'll make the simplifying assumption that e_ab=e_rad. &nbsp;Given this,<br />[T=394K</em>\left(\frac{A_{ab}}{A_{rad}}\right)^{1/4}]<br />Now, the absorption area of an object is just the shape of the object flattened into the plane the incident radiation is perpendicular to. &nbsp;That is, the absorption area of a sphere is a circle (a sphere projected to 2D is always a circle), while the absorption area of a cylinder could be a sheet or a circle, or something stranger. &nbsp;The best area ratio we can ever have is that of a flat sheet, which gives 1/2. &nbsp;For a sphere, like the earth, the ratio is 1/4. &nbsp;As an aside, this gives an equilibrium temperature of the earth as ~5C, which is too cold. &nbsp;It turns out that we shouldn't neglect either the emissivity ratio or the natural greenhouse effect in the case of the earth.<br /><br />Now, we need to figure out the area ratio for us. &nbsp;In a <a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/05/human-radiation.html">previous post</a>&nbsp;I modeled myself as a cylinder with height 1.8 m and radius .14 m. &nbsp;Let us assume we are facing the sun dead on, beating down on our chests. &nbsp;This gives the cross sectional area of a sheet with width 2<em>.14 m =.28 m and height 1.8 m. &nbsp;This is an area of .5 m^2, while my total surface area is 1.7 m^2. &nbsp;This gives an area ratio of ~.3, or an equilibrium temperature of<br />[T=394K</em>(.3)^{1/4}\approx292K]<br />That is an equilibrium temperature of 19 C. &nbsp;Not too cold, but certainly not body temperature! &nbsp;So the sun will not save us. &nbsp;We also have to factor in the fact that we reflect better in the visual that we do in the infrared, so the emissivity ratio we set to 1 probably is less than that, reducing our equilibrium temperature even more. &nbsp;It is interesting to note, though, that if we model a human as a two sided sheet instead of a cylinder, we can bring our equilibrium temperature up to 331 K. &nbsp;That's ~58 C! &nbsp;So in our model our geometrical assumptions change whether or not we freeze or die of heat stroke.<br /><br />Finally, since it looks like the sun may not save us, lets see how much it might slow down our temperature loss. &nbsp;Instead of a net loss of 860W at body temperature, as we calculated yesterday, sticking with our cylindrical human we'll have a net loss of<br />[860W-1370W/m^2(.5m^2)=175W]<br />Similarly at our lowered body temperature of ~30 C, we'll be losing a net of ~105 W. &nbsp;Once again taking a geometric average gives an average power loss of ~135 W. &nbsp;Using the energy to cool we found yesterday it would take 16300 s, or 4.5 hours to freeze! &nbsp;Also note that if you're getting too hot or cold, given how much the geometry plays into things, by changing your orientation to the sun you'll be able to have a certain amount of control over how much you heat up or cool down. &nbsp;Also, make sure you rotate yourself so that you end up evenly heated, and not roasted on one side and frozen on the other!</p><p>There are <a href="../posts/freezing-in-space-ii-turn-on-the-sun-.html#disqus_thread">comments</a>.</p>                </article>
