<p>Today is the transit of Venus, which, aside from being a totally rad astronomical event, is also the perfect excuse to tell my favorite story of an unlucky Frenchman (I have many). <br /><br />This is by no means new and, if you've ever taken an astronomy course, you've probably already heard it. &nbsp;It is perhaps the closest thing Astronomy has to a ghost story, told though the glow of a flashlight on moonless nights to scare the children. <br /><br />This is the story of Guillaume Le Gentil, a dude that just couldn't catch a break.<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><span style="background-color: white; line-height: 19px;"></span><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background-color: white; line-height: 19px;">------</span></div><span style="background-color: white; line-height: 19px;"></span><br /><span style="background-color: white; line-height: 19px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Guillaume Joseph Hyacinthe Jean-Baptiste Le Gentil de la Galaisi√®re was a Frenchman with an incredibly long name. &nbsp;He was also an astronomer, though he hadn't started out that way. &nbsp;Monsieur Le Gentil (as his friends called him and so, then, shall we) had originally intended to enter the priesthood. &nbsp;However, he soon began sneaking away to hear astronomy lectures and quickly switched from studies of Heaven to those heavens more readily observed in a telescope.</span></span><br /><span style="background-color: white; line-height: 19px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></span><br /><span style="background-color: white; line-height: 19px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Le Gentil happened to get into the astronomy game at a very exciting time. &nbsp;The next pair of Venus transits was imminent and astronomers were giddy with anticipation. &nbsp;Though the previous transit of 1639 had been predicted, it was met with little fanfare and only a few measurements. &nbsp;But the transits of 1761 and 1769 would be different. &nbsp;People would be ready.</span></span><br /><span style="background-color: white; line-height: 19px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></span><br /><span style="background-color: white; line-height: 19px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">And the stakes were higher this time, too. &nbsp;Soon after the 1639 transit, Edmund Halley (he of the-only-comet-people-can-name fame) calculated that with enough simultaneous measurements, the distance from the Earth to the Sun (the so-called astronomical unit, or AU) could be measured fairly accurately. &nbsp;Since almost all other astronomical distances were known in terms of the AU, knowing its precise value would essentially set the scale for the cosmos.</span></span><br /><span style="line-height: 19px;"><br /></span><br /><span style="line-height: 19px;">Brand new telescopes in hand, the astronomers of Europe set sail for locations all over the world. &nbsp;</span><br /><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 19px;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 19px;">Le Gentil had been assigned to observe the transit from Pondicherry, a French holding on the eastern side of India. &nbsp;On March 26th, 1760, he began his long sea voyage around the Cape of Good Hope towards India.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 19px;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 19px;">The voyage from France to India was a bit too long for the ship Le Gentil hitched a ride on and he only made it as far as Mauritius (a small island off Madagascar). &nbsp;Dropped off with all his equipment, Le Gentil was left waiting for any ship at all to take him to Pondicherry.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 19px;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 19px;">Perhaps it was the Curse of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodo">Dodo</a> or perhaps it was just bad luck, but while he was waiting, Le Gentil learned that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Years'_War">war</a> had broken out between the French and the British, making a trip to British India very difficult for a Frenchman. &nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 19px;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 19px;">Then the monsoon season started, meaning that even if he could find a ship, it would have to take a much longer route to India than initially planned and that it would be very difficult to make the journey before the transit occurred.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 19px;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 19px;">Then, he caught dysentery for the first time.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 19px;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 19px;">Finally, after months of waiting, Le Gentil (barely recovered from his illness) left Mauritius for India in February of 1761. &nbsp;Though time appeared to be running out, the captain of the ship he was on promised he would be there to observe the transit in June. &nbsp;About halfway to India, the winds switched directions and the ship was forced to turn back to Mauritius.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 19px;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 19px;">Le Gentil dutifully observed the transit of Venus in 1761 from a rocky ship in the middle of the Indian Ocean. &nbsp;The data were useless and he never attempted any analysis.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 19px;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 19px;">Although he missed the first transit, these things come in pairs separated by eight years. &nbsp;There was still another chance. &nbsp;And with all this time to prepare, there was no way he was going to miss the second one.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 19px;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 19px;">In fact, there was a bit </span><i style="line-height: 19px;">too much</i><span style="line-height: 19px;">&nbsp;time. &nbsp;But as a world-traveling 18th century man of science, Le Gentil had plenty of other interests to fill his days. &nbsp;He was particularly interested in surveying the region around&nbsp;Madagascar.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 19px;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 19px;">So he made a really nice map of Madagascar. &nbsp;And then he ate some bad kind of some kind of animal and came down with a terrible sickness. &nbsp;He describes this illness and its "cure" in his journals:</span></div><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i><span style="line-height: 19px;">This sickness was a sort of violent stroke, of which several very copious blood-lettings made immediately&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 19px;">on my arm and my&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 19px;">foot, and emetic administered twelve hours afterwards, rid&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 19px;">me of it quite quickly. &nbsp;But there remained for seven or eight&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 19px;">days in my optic nerve a singular impression from this sickness;&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 19px;">it was to see two objects in the place of one, beside each other;&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 19px;">this illusion disappeared little by little as I regained&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 19px;">my strength...</span></i></blockquote>After recovering from both his sickness and the treatment, Le Gentil decided to begin his preparations for the 1769 transit of Venus. &nbsp;He calculated that either Manila or the Mariana Islands would be the ideal spot to observe. &nbsp;The Sun would be relatively high in the sky at both places when Venus passed by, meaning that the view would be through less atmosphere with a reduced chance of clouds passing through the line of sight.<br /><br />Le Gentil packed up his stuff and headed off to Manila, where he could catch another ship to get to the Mariana Islands. &nbsp;Arriving in Manila in 1766, the astronomer found himself exhausted from months of sickness and sea-voyage. &nbsp;So, when he was offered passage on a ship heading to the Mariana Islands, he quickly declined.<br /><br />That he chose not to depart Manila at that time was perhaps his one stroke of good luck in the entire journey. &nbsp;The ship sunk. &nbsp;Writing in his journal, Le Gentil appears to have developed that particular sense of humor that generally accompanies constant disappointment:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>It is true that only three or four people were drowned, those who&nbsp;were the most eager to save themselves, which is what almost always&nbsp;happens in shipwrecks. &nbsp;I cannot answer that I would not have&nbsp;increased the number of persons eager to save themselves.</i></blockquote></blockquote>In any case, Le Gentil was in Manila with plenty of time to prepare for the next transit.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the astronomer may have&nbsp;over-prepared. &nbsp;Having arrived three years before the event, he now had three years to worry and second-guess his decision. &nbsp;It didn't help that the Spanish governor of Manila was kind of a crazy person. &nbsp;Not wanting to miss the observation of a lifetime owing to the whims of mildly insane strong man, Le Gentil packed up his stuff and headed to Pondicherry.<br /><br />Finally in Pondicherry, Le Gentil worked tirelessly to construct his observatory and make plenty of astronomical observations in preparation for the event. &nbsp;He had state of the art equipment and had fully calibrated and double checked everything. &nbsp;It was now nine years since his journey began and only a few days until the transit was scheduled to occur at sunrise on June 4th.<br /><br />The entire month of May was beautiful weather and pristine observing conditions, as were the first few days of June. &nbsp;Le Gentil likely went to bed on the 3rd of June fully confident that the next morning would be no different. <br /><br />He woke up early in the morning to begin preparations for his sunrise observations only to find clouds on the horizon. &nbsp;The clouds remained, obscuring the sun, all through the duration of the transit. &nbsp;A few hours after the end of the transit, the sun broke through the clouds and remained visible for the rest of the day. &nbsp;Le Gentil had missed his second transit in Pondicherry. <br /><br />He sums it up in his journal:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>That is the fate which often awaits astronomers. &nbsp;I had gone more&nbsp;than ten thousand leagues; it seemed that I had crossed such a great&nbsp;expanse of seas, exiling myself from my native land, only to be the&nbsp;spectator of a fatal cloud which came to place itself before the sun&nbsp;at the precise moment of my observation, to carry off from me the&nbsp;fruits of my pains and of my fatigues</i></blockquote></blockquote>In Manila, the Sun rose in perfectly clear skies.<br /><br />Distraught, Le Gentil remained in bed for some weeks afterward. &nbsp;He soon caught a fever and missed the ship that was supposed to take him home.<br /><br />He recovered, but then came down with dysentery again. <br /><br />Barely recovered from his various illnesses, he managed to get a ride back to Mauritius. &nbsp;He caught a ship leaving the island in November of 1770.<br /><br />The ship was struck by a hurricane and almost completely destroyed. &nbsp;It managed to limp back to Mauritius. <br /><br />The second attempt proved more successful and Le Gentil finally "set foot on France at nine o'clock in the morning, after eleven&nbsp;years, six months and thirteen days of absence."<br /><br />Though he had finally made it home, he was not out of the woods quite yet. &nbsp;In his absence, Le Gentil's heirs had tried to declare him dead to gain their&nbsp;inheritance, his accountant had mishandled (and lost) a large chunk of his holdings, and the Academy of Sciences, which had sent him on his 11 year mission, had given his seat to someone else.<br /><br />It was not quite the welcome home he had hoped for. <br /><br />Despite his seemingly never-ending misfortune, things did turn around for Le Gentil. &nbsp;He married, had a daughter, and was reinstated into the Academy of Sciences. &nbsp;Presumably, he lived out the rest of his days in relative happiness.<br /><br />Le Gentil died in 1792. &nbsp;Keeping true to his style, this man who missed&nbsp;two of the most important astronomical events of his time fortunately managed to also miss&nbsp;the most important (and violent)&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reign_of_Terror">political event</a> of his time.<br /><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background-color: white; line-height:
