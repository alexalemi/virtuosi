<p>Newton's laws of motion, first set down by Sir Isaac Newton in the 17th century, were mankind's first step towards an analytical understanding of the physical world.  The laws describe the motion of all kinds of objects, from the flight of a head-seeking apple to the motion of the stars in the heavens.  The laws have made an uncountable number of predictions about our universe that have been experimentally verified. </p>
<p>All academics and scientists fully support the teaching of this "Newtonian mechanics" and as such our national teaching standards strongly recommend it be included in all high school science curriculum.  Despite this strong scientific bill of health, our nation's teachers seem reluctant to fully endorse Newtonian mechanics.  More and more teachers, it seems, are instead supporting the so-called "alternative" theories of mechanics like magic or gnome theory [1].
<div></div><div>In a recent survey of our nation's high school science teachers, 13% of those surveyed explicitly advocate magic or gnome theory by spending at least one hour of class time presenting it in a positive light.  An additional 5% of teachers report that they endorse magic or gnome theory in passing or when answering questions. </p>
<p></div><div></div><div>In fact, some of these teachers claim<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"> that they (not the professional scientists) are the ones practicing proper science.  One teacher commented, “I don’t teach the theory of Newtonian mechanics in my physical science classes, nor do I teach the Theory of Gravitation in my Astronomy classes... We do not have time to do something that is at best poor science.”  Others reject the idea that we can ever fully understand motion.  Another teacher responded, “I am always amazed at how Newtonian mechanics and magic are treated as if they are right or wrong. They are both belief systems that can never be truly or fully proved or discredited.”</p>
<p>Although we should be comforted by the fact that 28% of our nation's teachers place Newtonian mechanics at the center of their physical science curriculum and present strong evidence in support, there still remains a large fraction of teachers that take a more </span>ambivalent<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"> stance.  In fact, nearly 60% of teachers are not strong advocates of either side.  These "non-partisan" teachers do present Newtonian mechanics in class, but they often bring it up as a "necessary evil."  These teachers often are willing to take Newtonian mechanics and magic on the same level but require that students learn mechanics only because it will "be on the test."</span>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">
</span>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">.....</span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">Obviously, I've just made all that up.  As far as I know, Newton's laws still reign supreme in high school physics courses throughout the land.  But it's a whole different story for our country's biology classrooms.  Almost the entirety of what I wrote above was lifted from a new article in <i>Science </i>[2], all I've done is replace the words "evolution" [3] by "Newtonian mechanics," "creationism" with "magic", and "intelligent design" with "gnome theory." </span>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">
</span>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">Now, I don't think it's a huge stretch.  Newton's laws are what tie all of classical physics together, without them nothing makes sense.  Likewise, natural selection is what ties all of biology together, without it nothing makes sense.  For want of a better metaphor, evolution by means of natural selection is the "law of motion" for biological systems.  You can still study each animal and plant separately without it, but there's no way of bringing it all together and connecting the dots.</span>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">
</span>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">My fake article above sounds laughably absurd and that was kind of the point.  But when we undo all the word replacements I've made it should sound just as absurd.  But according to the new survey, almost 70% of teachers wouldn't think so.        </span>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">
</span>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">This is bad news.  It's great to know fun facts about the universe and it's very satisfying to be able to explain an observed phenomenon, but it's absolutely essential for the public to have a basic understanding of <i>how</i> science works.  </span>To say that centuries of scientific consensus and thousands and thousands of peer-reviewed scientific articles are on the same level as the personal feelings and beliefs of a high school student is not only absurd, it's dangerous.  It leads to a less-informed public, which means more people willing to replace traditional medicine for things like homeopathy and magical magnetic miracle cures.  It leads to more people being scammed into buying useless junk or investing in schemes promising impossible returns.  It leads to more people willing to accept lies and half-truths. </p>
<p>Now we can go on and on about the importance of "truth" and potential for science to inspire and promote innovation and a technological advantage in this country, but sometimes it's just easier to take a more cynical approach.  Take a look back at all those reasons listed above for why scientific illiteracy is such a bad thing.  What do they all have in common?  <i>Wasted money</i>.  So instead of talking about cutting funding for NPR, why not take a stronger stance on scientific education for a balanced budget?</p>
<p>Somehow, I don't think that's going to happen.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"> [1]  Gnome theory claims to be a more scientific version of the magic theory.  Whereas the magic theory states that objects move "because of magic," gnome theory proposes that tiny invisible gnomes are responsible for moving all the objects in the universe.  These gnomes are undetectable and have no other observed properties besides the motions they induce.  "It's not magic," its proponents are quick to point out, "it's gnomes!"  </span>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">
</span>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">[2]  If you are lucky enough to reside in your academic ivory towers where those criminally high journal subscriptions are paid for you, check out the original article <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/331/6016/404.full.pdf">here</a>.  If not, a summary can be found <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/answer-sheet/science/study-most-high-school-biology.html">here</a> and the Penn State press release can be found <a href="http://live.psu.edu/story/51023">here</a>. </span>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">
</span>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">[3]  The article constantly refers to "evolution" which is the gradual change of a species over time.  I don't think people actually challenge this...?  Anyway, what should be in the article is "evolution by means of natural selection."  Natural selection is the mechanism proposed by Charles Darwin by which new species evolve from older ones.  Hence the long title, "On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection." </span></div></p><p>There are <a href="../posts/newton-vs-magic.html#disqus_thread">comments</a>.</p>                </article>
