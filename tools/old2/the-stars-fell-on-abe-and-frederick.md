  The 1833 Leonids (Source: Wikipedia)
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Word on the street is there's a meteor shower set for late Tuesday
night, peaking at 2 am EST on January 4th [[1]](#footnote-1)[](). The
meteors in question are the
[Quadrantids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrantids), which often go
unnoticed for two good reasons. Reason the first: apparently
[[2]](#footnote-2)[](), they are usually pretty awful. Unlike the "good"
meteor showers, the Quadrantids are bright and pretty for only a few
hours (instead of a few days). This means that a lot of the time, we
just miss them. Reason the second: they have a lame name
[[3]](#footnote-3)[](). But this year, they should be pretty good if the
weather is right. Now, there's lots of neat physics to talk about with
meteors, but that's not why I bring it up. This has all just been flimsy
pretext so I could share a historical anecdote about a meteor shower.
Trickery, indeed. Those who feel cheated are free to leave now with
[heads held high](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apu_585SW18). Those
still around (Hi, Mom!) will hear about the night in 1833 when the stars
fell on [Alabama](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ibV3tCDvd8) (and the
rest of the country, too). The
[Leonids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonids) typically put on a
pretty good show, but their showing in 1833 was so dramatic that the
term "meteor shower" was coined to describe what was happening. The 1833
Leonids were truly one for the ages and made such an impression that
people were often able to remember when events happened by their
relation to the night when "the stars fell." It was in this use as a
"calendar anchor" that I first heard of this particular meteor shower.
While home for the holiday I was reading *Life and Times of Frederick
Douglass*, one of the later autobiographies written by the former slave
and noted abolitionist. Recounting when he was moved from Baltimore to a
plantation on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, Douglass writes:

> I went to St. Michaels to live in March, 1833. I know the year,
> because it was the one succeeding the first cholera in Baltimore, and
> was also the year of that strange phenomenon when the heavens seemed
> about to part with their starry train. I witnessed this gorgeous
> spectacle, and was awe-struck. The air seemed filled with bright
> descending messengers from the sky. It was about daybreak when I saw
> this sublime scene. I was not without the suggestion, at the moment,
> that it might be the harbinger of the coming of the Son of Man; and in
> my then state of mind I was prepared to hail Him as my friend and
> deliverer. I had read that the "stars shall fall from heaven," and
> they were now falling. I was suffering very much in my mind. It did
> seem that every time the young tendrils of my affection became
> attached they were rudely broken by some unnatural outside power; and
> I was looking away to heaven for the rest denied me on earth.

Douglass wrote these words almost 50 years after the fact and it is
evident that the meteor shower clearly had an effect on him. By this
time (at age 15), Douglass had already made up his mind to escape from
slavery. Three years later, he made a failed attempt. Two years after
that, in 1838, Frederick Douglass escaped to the North and became an
influential abolitionist. After reading the above passage from Douglass,
I wondered who else may have seen the 1833 Leonids. After a bit of
research, I found a paper by [Olson & Jasinski
(1999)](http://ecommons.txstate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&context=physfacp&sei-redir=1&referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fsa%3Dt%26rct%3Dj%26q%3Dolson%2Blincoln%2Bleonids%26source%3Dweb%26cd%3D1%26ved%3D0CB4QFjAA%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fecommons.txstate.edu%252Fcgi%252Fviewcontent.cgi%253Farticle%253D1004%2526context%253Dphysfacp%26ei%3DaogCT_2TB4rv0gGZ_5HoBw%26usg%3DAFQjCNE8HE4-k_Zcl2PzK2shdtMCi6ZyEQ#search=%22olson%20lincoln%20leonids%22)
which provides an excerpt from Walt Whitman recounting a story told by
Abraham Lincoln. Whitman writes:

> In the gloomiest period of the war, he [Lincoln] had a call from a
> large delegation of bank presidents. In the talk after business was

Abraham Lincoln witnessed the 1833 meteor shower and was still telling
stories about it 30 years later.

So what's the point of this whole story? Is there any significance to
the fact that the man who escaped slavery to tell the world of its evils
and "The Great Emancipator" both saw the same meteor shower? Probably
not. Tons of people saw it.

Regardless, it is interesting to think about. Though these men would
cross paths several times over the next 30 years, the earliest memory
they shared was of a night in 1833, when a 15 year old slave in Maryland
and a 24 year old boarder in Illinois watched the stars fall from the
sky.

so this is all Wikipedia, baby! [[back]](#back-2)

[3] Like other meteor showers, the Quadrantids take their name from the
constellation from which the meteors seem to emerge. In this case,
[Quadrans Mural](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrans_Muralis): The
Mural Quadrant. Unfortunately for Quadrans Mural, the constellations
dumped it like the planets dumped Pluto. [[back]](#back-3)
