We've added a new feature here at the Virtuosi.  Ask a Physicist.  To the right in the sidebar you will see a link to our shared email account.  Feel free to send us email asking any question you desire.  We will do our best as starting PhD Graduate students to answer. 

Wondering about some physics principle?  Want to know what life as a grad student is like?  Want to know our favorite music?  Ask away.
