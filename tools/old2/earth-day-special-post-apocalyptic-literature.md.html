At some point in elementary school I got into the habit of reading Franz Kafka's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Metamorphosis"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Metamorphosis</span></a> every time that I got sick.  I found it strangely comforting to be reminded that while I might have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlet_fever">scarlet fever</a> and be intermittently hallucinating about Mickey Mouse, at least I had not been (spoiler alert!) turned into a giant cockroach and disowned by my family.

Today is <a href="http://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en#q=Earth+Day&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;fp=38378e84586d88e6">Earth Day</a>!  The earth has seen better days, and I got too depressed googling various environmental problems to even come up with a suitable list of examples.  However, look on the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlBiLNN1NhQ">bright side</a>: things could be much, much worse.  To explore how much worse it could be, here's a few of my favorite works of post-apocalyptic fiction - perfect reading for Earth Day.  Skip past the cut to check them out.

In no particular order, here's some of my favorite post-apocalyptic fiction.  Many of these are aimed more toward young adults, and since this is a science blog, I've also tried to score them arbitrarily on their scientific plausibility (0-10).  Check out the associated amazon pages for better descriptions and reviews.

<ul><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Z-Zachariah-Robert-C-OBrien/dp/0020446500"><span style="font-style: italic;">Z for Zachariah</span></a> - Robert C. O'Brien - Where's the best place to be when a nuclear war goes down?  In a isolated valley in upstate New York, apparently!  <span style="font-style: italic;">Z for Zachariah</span> follows a 16 year old girl who is left to fend for herself after the bombs go off, until a Cornell chemistry postdoc shows up in a radiation suit.  7/10</li><li><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.amazon.com/Postman-Bantam-Classics-David-Brin/dp/0553278746/ref=pd_sim_b_3">The Postman</a> - David Brin - Another in the post-nuclear war sub-genre.  The story gets bogged down in weird survivalist themes in the second half, but paints a rather believable portrait of the aftermath of a nuclear winter.  5/10</li><li><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.amazon.com/Canticle-Leibowitz-Walter-Miller-Jr/dp/0060892994/ref=pd_sim_b_5">A Canticle for Liebowitz</a> - Walter Miller - Have you ever been stuck in a waiting room at the dentist's and the only thing to read is a Reader's Digest from 1983?  In the future, it's like that, only way worse.  6/10</li><li><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.amazon.com/Childhoods-End-Del-Rey-Impact/dp/0345444051/ref=pd_sim_b_5">Childhood's End</a> - Aurthur C. Clark - Sometimes the end of the world is surprisingly zen.  3/10</li><li><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.amazon.com/Gift-Upon-Shore-M-Wren/dp/0595143415/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1303485614&amp;sr=1-1">A Gift Upon the Shore</a> - M. K. Wren - Rural Oregon also turns out to be a decent place to ride out a nuclear winter.  Everything is great, unless your only surviving neighbors are fundamentalists.  7/10</li><li><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.amazon.com/Emergence-David-R-Palmer/dp/B002U4W1QA/ref=sr_1_8?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1303485800&amp;sr=1-8">Emergence</a> - David R. Palmer - This is probably my favorite work in this genre.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Emergence</span> is the diary of a very plucky Candidia Smith-Foster, who, along with a pet parrot, has survived a communist bio attack.  Things get a bit nutty in the end, but overall a very enjoyable read.  Despite great reviews it's currently out of print, although a movie may be in the works.  8/10</li><li><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://listverse.com/2009/02/12/10-great-post-apocalyptic-science-fiction-novels/">I am Legend</a><span style="font-style: italic;"> <span style="font-style: italic;">- </span></span>It turns out that Will Smith was actually playing an older white dude.  Who knew?  It shares strange religious overtones with the movie, but much better written and with a totally different ending.  4/10</li><li><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.amazon.com/Pesthouse-Vintage-Jim-Crace/dp/0307278956/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1303487441&amp;sr=1-1">The Pesthouse</a> - Jim Crace - Society has gone a long way backwards, but they hear everything is better in Europe.  5/10</li><li><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.amazon.com/Road-Movie-Tie--Vintage-International/dp/0307476316/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1303487550&amp;sr=1-1">The Road</a> - Cormac McCarthy - I can't say I'm a huge fan of his writing style, but the world that Cormac McCarthy creates here is very compelling, although mind-numbingly depressing.  9/10
</li></ul>This is by no means an exhaustive list - there's a lot of classics that I haven't gotten around to reading yet such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beach-Vintage-International-Nevil-Shute/dp/0307473996/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1303487212&amp;sr=1-1"><span style="font-style: italic;">On the Beach.</span></a> I also have high hopes for Kim Stanley Robinson's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312890362?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jamifrat-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0312890362"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Wild Shore</span></a> since I enjoyed his Mars series.  Anyone else have anything to add?  Happy Earth Day!
