We had our first meeting.  It seems like Sunday at 8:00 pm is the best time to meet for those present, starting this Sunday.  Also we threw around an initial set of problems to discuss.

Problems:
<ul><li> 001: A bouncy ball with a ridge on it.  The ball has radius r with ridge radius R.  Take the ridge to be thin.  What kind of rotations are allowed for the ball to continue to bounce normally?
</li><li> 002: DEI theory.  What happens if Energy isn't conserved.  Does physics break?  Or is it just more complicated?
</li><li> 003: Delayed Quantum Eraser.  What happened?  Does it make sense?  What happens if you point this into the sky?  Start with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_choice_quantum_eraser">Wiki page</a>
</li><li> 004:  Interconnect Problem.   How do we not violate Moore's Law.  Current chips have reached a certain limit.  The problem is that copper is wasteful:  too much heat, too much loss.  How do we connect the transistors in the next generation chip.
</li><li> 005: US Presidential Uncertainty.  What is the uncertainty of the US Presidential election.  Is it part of one percent? one percent?  5 percent?
</li><li> 006: Feynman Sprinkler.  What happens if you take a standard S shaped sprinker, submerge it in water, and suck water in.  Which way does it turn?
</li><li> 007: Traffic Strategy.  If you are on a multilane highway, which lane is the best?  Do you switch lanes in a traffic jam?  Do you stay put?
</li></ul>

These are just some to think about.  So for Sunday, bring us what you've thought about these problems, or some new problems to think about, or some interesting news or papers to talk about.
