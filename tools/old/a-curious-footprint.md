If everything goes according to the kind-of-crazy-what-the-heck-is-a-sky-crane plan, this process will be referred to as "landing" (otherwise, more crashy/explodey gerunds will no doubt be used). 

The MSL mission is run through NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory where, by coincidence, I happen to be at the moment.  Now, I'm not working on this project, so I don't have a lot to add that <a href="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/index.cfm">isn't</a> <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2012/08/02/curiositys-chem-lab-on-mars/">available</a> <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2012/07/20/43-years-later-were-seven-minutes-away-from-a-second-great-step-forward/">elsewhere</a>.  BUT I do feel an authority-by-proximity kind of fallacy kicking in, so how about a post why not?

<a name='more'></a><h3>Preliminaries</h3><div>Before we get started, I feel obligated to link to NASA's <i><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ki_Af_o9Q9s">Seven Minutes of Terror</a> </i>video.  If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend watching it right now (my favorite part is the subtitles).  It has over a million views on YouTube and seems to have done a pretty good job at generating interest in the mission.  Although, it's a shame they had to interview the first guy in what appears to be a police interrogation room.  Oh well.</div><div>
</div><h3>About the Rover</h3><div>This thing is <i>big</i>.  It's the size of a car and is jam-packed with <a href="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/mission/instruments/">scientific equipment</a>.  There's a couple different spectrometers, a bunch of cameras, a drill for collecting rock samples, and radiation detectors.  Probably the coolest instrument onboard <i>Curiosity</i> is called the ChemCam.  The ChemCam uses a laser to vaporize small regions of rock, which allows it to study the composition of things about 20 feet away.  </div><div>
</div><div>In addition to the scientific payload, <i>Curiosity</i> also needs some way to generate power.  Previous rovers had been powered by solar panels, but there don't appear to be any here.  Instead, <i>Curiosity</i> is <a href="http://www.ne.doe.gov/pdfFiles/MMRTG_Jan2008.pdf">powered</a> by the heat released from the radioactive decay of about 10 pounds of plutonium dioxide.  This source will power the rover for <strike>about a Martian year</strike> well beyond the currently planned mission duration of one Martian year (about 687 Earth days)  <i>[Thanks to Nathan in the comments for pointing this out!]</i>.</div><div>
</div><div>To summarize, the rover is a nuclear-powered lab-on-wheels that <i>shoots lasers out of its head</i>.  This is pretty cool.</div><div>

All the shiny rover models have been taken out of the visitor's center and put in a tent outside, presumably so there will be a pretty backdrop for press reports and the like. </div><div>
</div><div>Anyway, I was out taking pictures of the rovers at the end of the day today when someone pointed out something cool about the tires on <i>Curiosity</i>.</div><div>
</div><div>Here's a close-up:</div><div>
</div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZAritHZ1usE/UBzfOUrM_oI/AAAAAAAAAZ0/meA5wgE6HCM/s1600/MSL_tire.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="266" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZAritHZ1usE/UBzfOUrM_oI/AAAAAAAAAZ0/meA5wgE6HCM/s400/MSL_tire.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Hole-y Tires</td></tr></tbody></table><div>Each tire on the rover is has "JPL" punched out in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:International_Morse_Code.svg">Morse code</a>!  Makes sense, though.  If you're going to spend $2.5 billion on something, you might as well put your name on it.</div><div>
</div><h3>Watch the Landing</h3><div>If you want to watch the landing, check out the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/index.html">NASA TV stream</a>.  The landing is scheduled for Sunday night at 10:31 pm PDT (1:31 am EDT).  Until then, it looks like they are showing a lot of interviews and other cool behind-the-scenes kind of stuff.</div>
