I suggest we meet sometime at night, preferably later in the week, perhaps Thursday, Friday, Saturday or Sunday night.  I think the War Room would make a good location.

I suggest the first meeting be this Thursday at 11:00 in the War Room.

As for the initial set of problems, there have been a few things I've been thinking about lately, they include:
<ul><li> DEI Theory:  what happens if Energy isn't conserved?  What are the consequences?
<li> Delayed Quantum Eraser Experiment as it relates to Free Will.
<li> Possibility for the use of the Delay Quantum Eraser for Astronomical Observation.  What happens if you point it into the sky.
<li> Motion of a bouncy ball with a ridge
</ul>

These are just some of the suggestions I have to start with.  I don't mean in anyway for these to be binding.
