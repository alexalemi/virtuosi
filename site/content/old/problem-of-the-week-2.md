</i><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why did the ant cross the rubber band?</span><i>

</i></div>A rubber band is held fixed at one end. The other end is pulled at a velocity <span style="font-style: italic;">v</span>. At time <span style="font-style: italic;">t</span> = 0, the rubber band has a length of <span style="font-style: italic;">L</span>, and an ant starts crawling from one end to the other at velocity <span style="font-style: italic;">u</span>.

Does the ant reach the other side? If so, how long does it take to get there? Assume that the rubber band is able to be stretched indefinitely without breaking.
