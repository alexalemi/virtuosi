Most of the names made sense to me.  For example, Nobelium is named after Alfred Nobel (surprise!).  However, the Nickel entry was the following:

Nickel: Named after <i>Satan </i>or <i>Old Nick</i>
<i>
</i>
This confused me greatly.  What the heck is Santa Claus doing hanging out with Satan [1]? 

After a bit of poking around on the internet, I found an article from 1931 by a guy named William Baldwin called <i>The Story of Nickel,  How "Old Nick's" Gnomes were Outwitted</i>.  Needless to say, this did not allay my confusion.

<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">Here is the relevant passage from the article:</span>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">
</span>
<i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">In the early part of the eighteenth century fresh lodes of ore were laid open in Saxony where  from times immemorial silver and copper mines had been worked.  This new ore was so glittering and full of promise as to cause the greatest excitement,  but after innumerable trials and endless labor all </span></i>
<i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">that could he obtained from the ore was a worthless metal.  In disgust the  superstitious miners named the ore kupfer-nickel after "Old  Nick" and his mischievous gnomes who were charged with  plaguing the miners and bewitching the ore.</span></i>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">
</span>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">This "worthless" metal is nickel.  Kupfernickel is the German name for the nickel ore (see image below) which comes from the words <i>kupfer</i>, meaning "copper" and <i>nickel</i>, meaning "demon."  </span>

<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">
</span>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">[1]  Turns out "Old Nick" is an English name for the Devil.  Go figure.  But those of you named Nicholas should not be upset, as your name comes from the Greek <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">Nikholaos</span>, which literally means "victory-people."  So you've got that going for you.</span>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">
</span>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">[2]  I have no plans of ever doing this again.</span>
