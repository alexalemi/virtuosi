So, some of us over here at Virtuosi Central have organized a challenge problem for the physics community here at Cornell.  Well, we thought we would open up the challenge to the great wide world.  The more submissions the merrier.  

The deadline is March 1, and submissions can be sent to our email.

Details can be found at <a href="http://bit.ly/physicschallenge">bit.ly/physicschallenge</a>.

Good luck and happy hunting.
