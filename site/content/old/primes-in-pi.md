Recently, I've been concerned with the fact that I don't know many large
primes. Why? I don't know. This has led to a search for easy to remember
prime numbers. I've found a few goods ones, namely

-   867-5309 - [Jenny's
    number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/867-5309/Jenny)
-   the digit 1 - 1031 times, in the style of the picture to above, and
    the largest known [repunit
    prime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repunit_prime#Repunit_primes)
-   1987 (my birth year), 2011 (last year), 1999 ([the party
    year](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_(song)))

But then I remembered that I already know 50 digits of pi, memorized one
boring day in grade school, so this got me wondering whether there were
any primes among the digits of pi

Lo an behold, I wrote a [little
script](https://gist.github.com/2033970), and found a few:

Found one, with 1 digits, is: 3 Found one, with 2 digits, is: 31 Found
one, with 6 digits, is: 314159 Found a rounded one with 12 digits, is:
314159265359 Found one, with 38 digits, is:
31415926535897932384626433832795028841

I think it's usual for most science geeks to know pi to at least
3.14159, if you're one of those people, now you know a 6 digit prime!
for free!
