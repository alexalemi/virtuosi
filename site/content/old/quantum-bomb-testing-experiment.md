Forbes and I would like to discuss <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elitzur-Vaidman_bomb-testing_problem">this experiment</a> at the next meeting. Specifically, Forbes raises the interesting question of how to make an experiment such as this completely isolated from extra observation. More specifically, suppose the experimenter had not been careful and had an experimental set-up which allowed an extra observer on the bomb path. We both think that this would cause the wave function to collapse and make the detecting method unusable. Given this, we cannot imagine an experimental setup where such information would not be available to an ideal observer.
