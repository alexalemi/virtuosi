Hello, again! Remember us? I don't. Anyway, apologies for the lack of
activity here. There are plenty of people* to blame for this lack of
activity, but I don't want to name names. The real purpose of this
pseudo-update is to SUPER DUPER promise that the winners of our first
Monthly Physics Challenge problem will be announced tomorrow. Thanks for
your patience!
In the meantime, there's a totally rad video-ification of photos of
Saturn (and moons) taken by the Cassini spacecraft that was Astronomy
Picture of the Day yesterday and will (presumably) be part of an IMAX
[movie](http://www.outsideinthemovie.com/) in the future. You can check
it out [here](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110315.html).

  Saturn. It's a planet!
