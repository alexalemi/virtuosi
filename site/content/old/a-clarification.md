As there seems to be some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_format#Date_format">confusion</a> among my fellow Virtuosi, I wanted to point out that Pi day occurs on July 22nd or, in the year 4159, on January 3rd.

Today is in fact <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waring%27s_problem">Seventh Power Day</a>.
