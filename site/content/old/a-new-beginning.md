Being inspired by a Colloquium given today at Cornell by Chad Orzel over at <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/principles/">Uncertain Principles</a>, I'm going to try and resurect this old beast and begin anew.

The general plan is that I will try and read more scientific papers, translating them into plainer english, as well as solve little problems or puzzles that I dream up.

Wish me luck, perhaps I will get some of my friends involved.
