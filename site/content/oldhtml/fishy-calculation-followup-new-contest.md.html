Well, the results came in a while ago, but I forgot to mention that <a href="http://diaryofnumbers.blogspot.com/2010/05/we-have-winner.html">I lost</a> the contest.  I was about two orders of magnitude off from the winning answer.

In light of my failure, I'm going to try again in the <a href="http://diaryofnumbers.blogspot.com/2010/05/hamster-powered-mansions.html">newest contest</a>.  This time the question is a bit stranger:

<blockquote>How many buff hamsters would it take to completely power a mansion?  </blockquote>
I encourage all of The Virtuosi readers to enter as well, it only takes a minute to come up with some number.

Good luck one and all.
