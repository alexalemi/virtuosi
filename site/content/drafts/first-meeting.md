I suggest we meet sometime at night, preferably later in
the week, perhaps Thursday, Friday, Saturday or Sunday night. I think
the War Room would make a good location. I suggest the first meeting be
this Thursday at 11:00 in the War Room. As for the initial set of
problems, there have been a few things I've been thinking about lately,
they include:

-   DEI Theory: what happens if Energy isn't conserved? What are the
    consequences?
-   Delayed Quantum Eraser Experiment as it relates to Free Will.
-   Possibility for the use of the Delay Quantum Eraser for Astronomical
    Observation. What happens if you point it into the sky.
-   Motion of a bouncy ball with a ridge

These are just some of the suggestions I have to start with. I don't
mean in anyway for these to be binding.
