 We had our first meeting of the term. We decided that we
were going to work some problems from [The Quantum Mechanics
Solver](http://books.google.com/books?id=gnTk2coIh3YC) for next week.
Four of us agreed to solve a chapter each and present it next week.
Topics to be covered:

-   Forbesy: Neutrino Oscillations
-   Max: Ideal Quantum Measurement
-   Todd: Hydrogen Atom in Crossed Fields
-   Alemi: EPR and Bell's Inequality

You should all come next week to learn some cool physics. Also, if
anyone thinks of some other interesting problem and makes some headway
on it, present that as well. I'll try and remember to bring snacks /
beverages for the next meeting.
