HYPOTHETICAL: I left my accelerometer running during a flight from ithaca to Detroit

reference last post

mention noise estimates and resolution

three part challenge:
analyze take-off
--lift-off speed
--acceleration
--noise levels
--relation between vibration and velocity?
analyze total flight duration
--find v(t)
--find x(t)
--does total flight distance match ithaca to detroit?
--is velocity reasonable?
analyze landing
--landing speed
--braking pattern
--noise levels

2 weeks?
