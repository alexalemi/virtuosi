In England during the 17th century, a new group of
thinkers emerged. These "natural philosophers" took it upon themselves
to ponder the workings of the world around them. As more of these
like-minded men emerged they formed a society, the Royal Society where
they would meet periodically to discuss the work and questions that
interested them. These men went by the title of virtuosi

> virtuoso noun plural virtuosi 4. Obsolete. a person who has special
> interest or knowledge in the arts and sciences; scientist; scholar. --
> Random House Unabridged Dictionary

I aim that this group provide an outlet for inquisitive minds at Caltech
to meet and discuss interesting problems, perhaps kooky, perhaps
unsolved, perhaps just plain interesting. Hopefully the meetings of the
Virtuosi may serve as a forum for us all to better ourselves outside of
our Sets and classes. The way I imagine it: we meet once a week and
people suggest interesting problems. Over the course of the next week,
if members have time they will think about some of the problems posed.
At the following meeting we each share what we've come up with and
critique/collaborate with each other. All interesting parties should
shoot me an email, I envision the group being open to all interested.
