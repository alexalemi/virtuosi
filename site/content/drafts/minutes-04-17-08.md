We had our second meeting. Nobody had really done a whole
lot since our meeting on Thursday. We decided to commit a bit to the
delayed quantum eraser experiment. For next week, everyone should at a
minimum read the [Wikipedia
page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_choice_quantum_eraser) and
one of the corresponding experiment papers, the Yoon-Hu Kim one: [arXiv
link](http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9903047) or the Marlan Scully one:
[Phys. Rev. A](http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRA/v25/i4/p2208_1)
(available on the Caltech network). Next week we will discuss what the
implications of the experiment are, and start to discuss whether we
could perform the experiment ourselves, and whether this could be useful
for observation (what happens if you point it into the sky). As another
side note, Max brought up a problem he had been thinking about. When you
are playing the guitar, you can hammer down or pull off. When he pull's
off, he noticed that the volume noticeably decreases. We looked at
whether this is an effect owing to the extension of the vibrating string
or some other effect. Assuming that most of the sound and excitation of
a guitar string is in the primary mode, we can calculate the amplitude
of the primary mode upon instantaneous string extension, after the
simple integral.

We can obtain the amplitude of the primary mode upon extension. Since
volume goes like amplitude squared we obtain a graph in dL in units of
L:

The plot seems to indicate that for dLs at about a tenth we should
expect an amplitude of 96% or so. In Max's experience the volume drops
more, which we conclude is probably the result of him being slow about
the pull off, dampening the string in the process. So, see you all next
week, and read up on the delayed quantum eraser.
