&nbsp;Well there was also a study done a month or so ago about dog shaking. &nbsp;If you have a dog, you have almost certainly experienced the elegant way in which a wet dog un-wettafies itself. &nbsp;Well, a few students at Georgia Tech were also familiar with this shaking and just happened to have a super high speed camera that could track water droplets. &nbsp;I assume it only took a short period of time to put two and two together and BAM! science happens.<br /><br />In addition to providing the logical extension of the "spherical cow" joke to "dog of radius R", the study also found some fairly surprising results. &nbsp;If we are spinning a wet cylinder (i.e. dog), we would assume that the water is held on by some "sticking force." &nbsp;Then to shake off these droplets, we'd assume that the dog would have to shake fast enough that the centrifugal force would overcome the sticking force. &nbsp;In other equations,<br /><br />\[ F_{centrifugal} = m{\omega}^2 R \]<br /><br />and<br /><br />\[ F_{sticking} = C \]<br /><br />So we would then expect the shaking frequency to be the frequency that gets those two guys to equal each other. &nbsp;We would thus predict<br /><br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">\[{\omega} \sim R^{-0.5} \]</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">where the little squiggle just means that the frequency scales as the radius to the -0.5 power, with some constant multipliers out front that we don't know so we just ignore. &nbsp;</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">But this is not what the Ga Tech guys observed! &nbsp;Check out the video below:</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><object height="385" width="480"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/kvoKN1UfLn0?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/kvoKN1UfLn0?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object><br /><br />So there's still something else going on that wasn't in our simple model. &nbsp;But this is what makes science so exciting! &nbsp;Even something dogs and cats figured out long ago can have some really rich and interesting physics. &nbsp;So keep on asking those questions!<br /><br /><br />Notes:<br /><br />[1] &nbsp;Interestingly enough, the first "How come [blank]?" questions we asked did not have the now canonical form. &nbsp;Instead, it was stated as "Why are cows?". &nbsp;After much deliberation, we found that the solution is "Because milkshakes." &nbsp;Fair enough. &nbsp;
