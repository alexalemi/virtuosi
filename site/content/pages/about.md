Title: About Us

We are a bunch of Physics Graduate students at Cornell. Our interests vary. Our
aim is to share a bit of the fun of physics with the world.

A note on the name: The virtuosi was the original name for the members of the
original Royal Society, they were a bunch of interested individuals who would
meet twice monthly in London to discuss the topics of interest in the budding
field of science. The Royal Society would go on to become the premier
scientific institution in the coming years, but they had rather humble
beginnings, one of their early meetings being dedicated to testing whether
unicorn horn powder could deter spiders.

A note on the masthead: "Giving some account of the undertakings, studies, and
labors of the ingenious in many considerable parts of the Cornell physics
department." is a ripoff of the masthead for the original Royal Society
publication Philosophical Transactions, whose masthead read: "Giving some
account of the undertakings, studies, and labors of the ingenious in many
considerable parts of the world." Seen below:

It is in this spirit that we aim to share some physics. Some of it silly, some
of it serious, but all of it interesting.
