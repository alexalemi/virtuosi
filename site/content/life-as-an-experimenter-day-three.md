<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Today marks the third and final day in our beam time at CHESS. &nbsp;I think the circles under all of our eyes may take away from the glamor a bit, but the right makeup specialist could fix that. &nbsp;If they ever make a movie about us, which they should, I want to be played by some really awesome british actor. &nbsp;I think that would be about right. &nbsp;Someone with a strong jaw. &nbsp;In case it's not obvious, lack of sleep is getting to me a little bit. &nbsp;Read on for the final few hours of our experiment.</span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><a name='more'></a></span><br /><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Friday 6/18</span></div><div><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">9:07am</span></b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;- Not sure if I didn't turn on my alarm, or turned it off without noticing. &nbsp;But somehow I manage to jerk awake not too much later than planned. &nbsp;Dragging a little bit. &nbsp;Get some food. &nbsp;No time for shower, do that in a few hours. &nbsp;Only have to get through to noon.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span> </div><div><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">9:41</span></b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;- Leave house. &nbsp;Hop in car. &nbsp;Realize as I drive through that there's a stop sign at a corner that I didn't see last night, mostly hidden by trees. &nbsp;Very glad there wasn't any traffic.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span> </div><div><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">9:54</span></b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;- Arrive back at CHESS. &nbsp;Set up laptop to stream the US game. &nbsp;Get a report from Matt and Ryan. &nbsp;Looks like the data that was exciting last night is actually repeatable, and though it is a small effect, probably real. &nbsp;This is a very nice bonus for our experiment, we were mostly expecting null results from that phase of things. &nbsp;Plan is to test that more, run some experiments to make sure we're not seeing other, more mundane, effects that would look the same with our collection methods.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span> </div><div><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">10:25</span></b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;- I take over crystal mounting. &nbsp;Matt is busy with data, and Ryan is not having luck with crystals this morning. &nbsp;That's how it goes. &nbsp;US is down a goal. &nbsp;Morale low for that reason.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span> </div><div><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">10:45</span></b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;- Data taking going okay. &nbsp;Still seeing the effect, though small. &nbsp;US down 2 goals. &nbsp;Not good at all.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span> </div><div><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">11:00</span></b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;- US down 1 goal! &nbsp;Oh yes. &nbsp;Some experiment. &nbsp;We're almost done, not paying too much attention any more. &nbsp;Everyone is slowing down.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span> </div><div><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">11:20</span></b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;- CHESS staff members keep on wandering into our area and staying to watch the game. &nbsp;Kind of fun. &nbsp;One got us an ethernet cable to eliminate some of the pauses we were getting in the streaming &nbsp;using the wireless. &nbsp;Set up a final run, determine if the effect is from what we suspect (hope?) or from mundane causes. &nbsp;Need to pack up and be out in 40 minutes.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span> </div><div><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">11:45</span></b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;- Experiment finishes. &nbsp;US is robbed! &nbsp;Should have been a victory.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span> </div><div><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">11:50</span></b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;- Mad scramble to pack up equipment. &nbsp;Crystals, mounts, computers, etc.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span> </div><div><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">11:58</span></b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;- Off the beam.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span> </div><div><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">12:05pm </span></b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">- Parking permit returned. &nbsp;On my way home. &nbsp;Taking the rest of the day off.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span> </div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span> </div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span> </div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">I hope that you, dear reader, have enjoyed this brief taste of how experiments go. &nbsp;I tried to let the emotions reflect what I actually was feeling at the time, but often for the most harrowing/exciting parts there was no time to write, so much of this has been upon reflection. &nbsp;Tomorrow I hope to offer a few insights into how experiments usually seem to go. &nbsp;A lot of people have never done experimental science, and experimentation in movies is </span><a href="http://xkcd.com/683/"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">very different</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"> from what we actually do. &nbsp;Now it's time to sleep. &nbsp;And maybe watch the England/Algeria game.</span></div>
