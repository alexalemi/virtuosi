One of my professors, <a href="http://www.physics.cornell.edu/people/faculty/?page=website/faculty&amp;action=show/id=80" title="who is now mentioned in two blogs in this context">Yuval Grossman</a>, was talking about the zoology of particle physics in class the other day. Trying to get us to remember such trivia as the mass of the <span style="font-style: italic;">B</span> meson, he noted that it's easier to remember two things than it is to remember one - and as it happens, the mass of the B meson is about 5280 MeV, which is also the length of a mile in feet (an equally obscure piece of trivia, if you ask me).<br /><br />This reminded of one of my first calculus classes  back home where another professor (Mikhail Sodin) chided us for not knowing the value of <span style="font-style: italic;">e</span>, 2.71828. This is easy to remember, he said because 1828 is the year Lev Tolstoy was born.<br /><br />Then again, when I came to write this post, I could neither remember <span style="font-style: italic;">e</span>, nor Tolstoy's year of birth - or even that it was Tolstoy, rather than Dostoevsky or some other Russian author. So perhaps two things are not easier to remember than one after all.
