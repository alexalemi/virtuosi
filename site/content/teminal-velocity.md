The impetus for this post lies with three facts. First, I like to bike to work. Second, Cornell sits on a <a href="http://www.cornell.edu/search/index.cfm?tab=facts&amp;q=&amp;id=272">hill</a>. And finally, I'm not very brave.<br /><br />As a result of all of these, along with Ithaca's less-than-optimal road maintenance, my semi-daily rides home tend to produce a lot of wear on my brakes as I cruise downhill at what appears to me to be very high speeds. I began to ponder just how high this speed really is, and if I could reduce my use of the brakes or if I'm going to end up using them anyway at the bottom of the hill.<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br /><br /><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5504225823691657218" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JIGLe2C6VxI/TGLwOVisUAI/AAAAAAAACD4/V9TvWzmEv9k/s200/200px-Free_body.svg.png" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 136px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 200px;" /><br /><br /><br /><center><span style="font-size: 85%;">Figure 1: An inclined plane</span></center><br /><br />So, I asked myself, what do I remember about bikes going down the hill? Well, I remember the good old inclined plane (figure 1), and I remember that air resistance is proportional to velocity, so that the equation of motion is given by<br />\[ ma = mg\sin\theta - \alpha v. \]<br /><br />I had no idea what <span style="font-style: italic;">α</span> was, though. My first stop in considering it was naturally Wikipedia. A quick <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_velocity">search</a> came up with the formula<br />\[m a = mg\sin\theta -  \frac{1}{2}\rho A C_d  v^2\]<br />where <span style="font-style: italic;">ρ</span> is the density of air, <span style="font-style: italic;">A</span> the projected area of the body and <span style="font-style: italic;">C<sub>d</sub></span><span style="font-size: 100%;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span> the drag coefficient<br /><br />The first thing to notice here is that I was wrong - drag in a fluid acts like the velocity squared, and not the velocity. Second, we can easily determine terminal velocity out of this formula - it's the speed at which the sum of the forces equals to zero, or<br />\[v_t = \sqrt{\frac{2mg\sin\theta}{\rho A C_d}}.\]<br /><br />We can throw in some numbers into that. <span style="font-style: italic;">ρ</span> = 1.2 kg/m<sup>3</sup> for air; Wikipedia estimates <span style="font-style: italic;">C<sub>d</sub></span> =  0.9 for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_coefficient">cyclist</a>. For the mass, we need to add up mine (~75 kg), the bike's (15-20 kg) and my bag's (let's say 5 kg). We come to about 100 kg, give or take 5%. <span style="font-style: italic;">A</span> is a little harder to estimate, but height times width gives me an initial guess of 0.62 m<sup>2</sup>, which I'll revise to 0.7 m<sup>2</sup> to account for the bike, flailing arms and fashionable helmet, up to about 10% accuracy.<br /><br />We're left with sinθ, which varies by road, but in general we expect the terminal velocity to look like<br />\[v_t \approx \left(50 \pm 3  \rm{m/s}\right) \sqrt{\sin\theta}.\]<br /><br />This appears not-unreasonable. For an 8% grade like we have down University avenue  this yields about 50  km/h and for a 13% grade like we have down Buffalo street this will bring us up to a respectable 65 <a href="http://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=8807287158334608095&amp;postID=6743488546064317383#miles" title="That's - sigh - about 30 mph and 40 mph, respectively, in crazy units">km/h</a>. Both, incidentally, are faster than I'm willing to go down a badly maintained, not entire straight road.<br /><br />So we have some numbers, and I begin to feel justified about pressing those breaks often, but all of this is really an introduction for the next post, in which I go against all my theorist instincts and take some data in the field.
