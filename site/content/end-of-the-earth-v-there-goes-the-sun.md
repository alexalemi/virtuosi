&nbsp;Well, the Earth will cool by radiating its heat away into space. &nbsp;To see how long this would take, let's make some assumptions.<br /><br />Let's model the surface of the Earth as an ocean 1 km deep and let's pretend that all the heat is stored in this ocean. &nbsp;Let's take the ocean to be liquid water at T = 0 degrees Celsius. &nbsp;How long will it take this ocean to freeze into ice at 0 degrees Celsius?<br /><br />Well, the amount of energy released from the oceans as the water freezes is given by<br /><br />\[ Q = L_{w} M_{ocean} \]<br /><br />where L is the "latent heat of fusion" and M is the mass of the water. &nbsp;The "latent heat of fusion" is a fancy way of saying "the amount of energy released per unit mass as water turns to ice at constant temperature." &nbsp;For water, we have that<br /><br />\[ L_{w} = 3.3 \times 10^5 \mbox{J/kg} \]<br /><br />And for the mass of the ocean, it will be convenient later to write it as<br /><br />\[ M_{ocean} = 4\pi {R_{\oplus}}^2 \Delta R \rho \]<br /><br />Alright, so now we've got enough to say how much heat energy we have, so how fast do we lose it? &nbsp;We can take the Earth to be a blackbody radiator, so the power lost in such a case is:<br /><br />\[ P =4\pi \sigma R_{\oplus}^2 T^4 \]<br /><br />Since Power is just Energy per unit Time, we now have all we need to get the time for total freezing of all the oceans. &nbsp;We have:<br /><br />\[ t = \frac{Q}{P} = \frac{4\pi {R_{\oplus}}^2 \Delta R \rho L_{w}}{4\pi \sigma R_{\oplus}^2 T^4} \]<br /><br />Simplifying the above expression a bit, we get<br /><br />\[ t =\frac{\Delta R \rho L_{w}}{\sigma T^4} \]<br /><br />Now we can plug in some numbers,<br /><br />\[ t =\frac{\left(10^3 \mbox{ m}\right) \times \left(10^3 \frac{kg}{m^3}\right) \times \left(3.3 \times 10^5 \mbox{J/kg}\right)}{\left( 5.67 \times 10^{-8} J s^{-1} m^{-2} K^{-4}\right) \times \left( 273 K\right)^4} \]<br /><br />where we have made sure to put our temperatures in Kelvin. &nbsp;Crunching the numbers with the calculator we "borrowed" from Nic three months ago gives:<br /><br />\[ t = 10^9 \mbox{ s} \]<br /><br />Remembering that a year is very nearly<br /><br />\[ 1 \mbox{ year} = \pi \times 10^7 \mbox{ s}, \]<br /><br />we find that the time for the oceans to freeze after the sun disappears is about 30 years. &nbsp;Hooray!<br /><br />Now this model was very simple. &nbsp;First of all, I assumed that the ocean temperatures were already at 0 degrees, but they are a bit warmer. &nbsp;If the oceans are about 300 K (ie 80 degrees in not-Yariv units), then we get another 30 years to cool down to freezing temperatures. &nbsp;Secondly, I have completely neglected the heat stored in the Earth. &nbsp;Will this change my answer by an&nbsp;embarrassingly&nbsp;large factor? &nbsp;Lastly, I have ignored all internal heating mechanisms (ie, radioactive decay) that will also heat up the Earth. &nbsp;But ignoring all that....<br /><br />So is there a way for anyone to survive this? &nbsp;Well, for the most part it will mean the end of life on Earth. &nbsp;There could potentially be a few exceptions, like by geothermal vents and such. &nbsp;But for the most part, it's one quick cold spiral down to eternal nothingness. &nbsp;But what about a few people, could they survive for a bit even if the human race is doomed?<br /><br />I'm glad you asked! &nbsp;You see, I have this plan involving mine shafts. &nbsp;Hunkering down underground with a nuclear power plant and all the canned food food we can stomach should allow us to at least ride the rest of our lives. &nbsp;Details can be found <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iesXUFOlWC0&amp;feature=related">here</a>.
