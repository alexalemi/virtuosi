The question on my mind today is: How much of the earth's surface would have to be covered to power the earth with wind turbines?<br /><br /><a name='more'></a>We can't hope to put an exact number on this, the best we'll be able to do is an order of magnitude. &nbsp;I also don't know much about wind turbines, so I'll be making liberal use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine">wikipedia</a>&nbsp;as I go. &nbsp;Let's start with the size of the wind turbine. &nbsp;According to wikipedia the largest wind turbine has a rotor sweep diameter of 128 m. &nbsp;To an order of magnitude, we'll say that our average wind turbine has a diameter of 100 m. &nbsp;Next we need to know how much power this puts out. &nbsp;The maximum power of this turbine is ~8 MW. &nbsp;However, it certainly wouldn't be producing that at all times. &nbsp;Current wind farms produce around 20-30% maximum capacity. &nbsp;However, these turbines are careful placed in areas of high wind. &nbsp;We're not going to get that lucky with our wind dose when we place our turbines haphazardly, so we'll assume they produce at 1% maximum capacity. <br /><br />According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_energy_resources_and_consumption">wikipedia</a>, the world energy consumption in 2008 was 474 EJ (exajoules), or an average power use in 2008 of 15 TW. &nbsp;To an order of magnitude then, the area we'd have to occupy with wind turbines to power the world would be:<br /><br />\[\left( \frac{(100\text{ m})^2}{1\text{ turbine}}\right)\left(\frac{1\text{ turbine}}{.01*8 \text{ MW}}\right)15 \text{TW} = 2\cdot 10^{12}\text{ m}^2\]<br /><br />That's 2*10^6 km^2, or, in english, 2 million square kilometers. &nbsp;For comparison, the land area of the united states is roughly 10 millon square kilometers. &nbsp;So we'd only have to cover 1/5th of the united states with wind turbines to power the entire world (in 2008, no doubt power use has risen since then)!<br /><br />While that is a lot of space taken up, it is nowhere near the entire surface of the world. <br /><br />There are, of course, <a href="http://xkcd.com/556/">other concerns</a> about wind power.<br /><br /><br /><i>Note: &nbsp;maybe the wind turbines are less efficient overall. &nbsp;Also, I assumed that the footprint was just the square area of the turbine diameter. &nbsp;I know this is the size of the face of the turbine, but to an order of magnitude I imagine it is correct for the space occupied on the ground.</i>
