Virtuosi Pelican Site
---------------------

This is the entire code base for the virtuosi site.  
Feel free to try to contribute by adding your markdown/rst/html files to content
and making a pull request.

To test your submissions, use the provided `Makefile` to aid in testing and building.

`make devserver` will build the site and start hosting it locally for you to look at at http://localhost:8000, 
and should automatically rebuild the site any time you make changes.

`./develop_server.sh stop` will stop the hosting and automatic builds.
