</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I'm an experimental physicist. &nbsp;If you think this sounds like a job second in glamour only to rock star you would be right. &nbsp;Just like being a rock star, you have to deal with the people, the shows, the lights, the groupies . . . okay, maybe I'm lying about the groupies. &nbsp;Unless you're <a href="http://groups.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=groups.groupprofile&amp;groupID=103575126">Brian Greene</a>. &nbsp;Also similar to a rock star, no one really knows what it is we do behind the scenes (when we're not touring the nation or publishing papers). &nbsp;I'd like to pull back that curtain a little bit.<br /><br /><a name='more'></a>A bit of background. &nbsp;For this data run we're looking at the structure of protein crystals. &nbsp;The basic idea is that if you have a bunch of proteins, you can create a crystal out of them using various synthesis techniques. &nbsp;If they're formed right, they look similar to the crystals you are more familiar with, quartz, diamond, emerald, etc. &nbsp;We're interested in how the proteins are held in the crystal, that is, what kind of structure the protein crystal has. &nbsp;I'll talk more about this at some other point. &nbsp;Our method for examining this is using x rays. &nbsp;Similar to a medical x-ray, we shoot x-rays at our sample, and look at the transmitted images. &nbsp;Of course, instead of something like this:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_SYZpxZOlcb0/TBpWZFChfhI/AAAAAAAAABs/Cp-4Rf5ca5Y/s1600/X-ray-hands.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="228" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_SYZpxZOlcb0/TBpWZFChfhI/AAAAAAAAABs/Cp-4Rf5ca5Y/s320/X-ray-hands.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>we see something like this:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_SYZpxZOlcb0/TBpWqG2OqLI/AAAAAAAAAB0/SncRJvsz1Uk/s1600/20071104200851!X-ray_diffraction_pattern_3clpro.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_SYZpxZOlcb0/TBpWqG2OqLI/AAAAAAAAAB0/SncRJvsz1Uk/s320/20071104200851!X-ray_diffraction_pattern_3clpro.jpg" /></a></div>which is a little bit harder to interpret. &nbsp;Nevertheless, we've got some pretty nifty software that will do the job for us. &nbsp;The unfortunate part about using x-rays is that to produce research grade x-rays takes really big expensive facilities, so we have a limited amount of time we get to use them for. &nbsp;Right now, we've got 48 hours of beam time, so we want to take data for as many of those 48 hours as possible. &nbsp;For those interested, we're using CHESS at Cornell, station F1.<br /><br /><br />Wednesday, 6/16<br /><b>9:30am </b>- Get up. &nbsp;I was warned by the postdoc in my group to sleep in as much as I could. &nbsp;Our data run starts at noon, and goes for 48 hours. &nbsp;Who knows how much sleep we'll get in those 48 hours. &nbsp;Our beam time starts at noon today. &nbsp;I eat breakfast, and realize that I've left my lab notebook in the lab. &nbsp;I need to swing by there and pick it up.<br /><br /><b>10:52</b>&nbsp;- Out of the house. &nbsp;My goal is to be at CHESS by 11. &nbsp;As this is my first time using the facility, &nbsp;I need to get a safety tour before I can use the beam line. &nbsp;I hope on my bike and speed towards to the physics building.<br /><br /><b>10:54</b>&nbsp;- Downpour. &nbsp;I get soaked. &nbsp;I'm wearing a rain jacket, but my jeans and shoes are soaked through.<br /><br /><b>10:55&nbsp;</b>- A pocket on my backpack comes unzipped, dumping my water bottle (and, as I find out later, my bike lock) into the road. &nbsp;I stop and retrieve the water bottle.<br /><br /><b>11:02</b>&nbsp;- Arrive at physics building. &nbsp;Hasten to the lab, dripping water. &nbsp;Grab notebook. &nbsp;Receive call from Ryan, another graduate student in the lab, saying he's at CHESS, and ready to take the safety tour when I am.<br /><br /><b>11:12 </b>&nbsp;- Arrive at CHESS. &nbsp;Realize I don't have my bike lock anymore. &nbsp;Call Ryan and tell him to take the tour without me, I'll get to it later. &nbsp;Hop on bike, ride route in reverse. &nbsp;Find lock right where water bottle fell out.<br /><br /><b>11:25</b>&nbsp;- Back at CHESS. &nbsp;Check in. &nbsp;Get given safety tour, radiation badge. &nbsp;Meet up with Ryan. &nbsp;Good times.<br /><br /><b>11:59</b>&nbsp;- Matt, the postdoc in my lab, with experience at CHESS and the samples and equipment, arrives.<br /><br /><b>12:00pm</b>&nbsp;- Beam time starts. &nbsp;We're not ready. &nbsp;For this run, we're using liquid helium to cool our sample. &nbsp;We have to get that set up first.<br /><br /><b>1:45</b>&nbsp;- With the aid of Ulrich, one of the Research Associates at CHESS, we have the liquid helium stream set up to cool our sample.<br /><br /><b>2:00 </b>- Matt trains Ryan and myself how to mount samples for the beam.<br /><br /><b>2:15</b>&nbsp;- Matt mounts a sample, and trains Ryan and myself how to operate beam controls.<br /><br /><b>2:30 </b>- Start taking data.<br /><br /><b>2:45 </b>- Crystal turns out to be not very crystalline. &nbsp;Rinse and repeat.<br /><br /><b>4:00</b>&nbsp;- After 7 increasingly frustrating attempts with bad crystals, the 8th turns out to give us a good signal. &nbsp;Looks like we're back in business.<br /><br /><b>4:15</b>&nbsp;- Getting anomalous signals from our sample. &nbsp;Every 5th image has about have the intensity of the others. &nbsp;Also getting some weird tiling in the image. &nbsp;No one knows what's going on. &nbsp;We call in Ulrich and the beam operator.<br /><br /><b>4:30 </b>- In the midst of trying to resolve the anomalous signals, the computer we're running the experimental control software on goes down. &nbsp;Requires calling in more tech support.<br /><br /><b>4:50 </b>- I take a break to eat. &nbsp;First food since breakfast. &nbsp;Two sandwiches and a half-frozen banana (kept it near the back of the fridge in the CHESS lounge. &nbsp;I learned my lesson).<br /><br /><b>5:10</b>&nbsp;- Food eaten. &nbsp;Computer back up. &nbsp;Data taking ready. &nbsp;Still no resolution for the anomalous signal. &nbsp;While the experts continue to trouble shoot, Matt attempts to figure out if we can run any of our experiments with the data as bad as it currently is.<br /><br /><b>5:45</b>&nbsp;- Still no solution. &nbsp;Matt has determined that none of our planned experiments will work with the data as bad as it is. &nbsp;Suspicion of a bad detector (a million dollar piece of equipment). &nbsp;Morale is low.<br /><br /><b>8:00</b>&nbsp;- After continued trouble shooting, Ulrich is convinced that the problem is a bad shutter for the x ray beam (just like a camera, you achieve a certain image exposure by letting the beam hit the sample/detector for a certain amount of time).<br /><br /><b>8:30</b>&nbsp;- Technician arrives to swap shutters. &nbsp;Operation successful! &nbsp;Data looks good.<br /><br /><b>9:00</b>&nbsp;- After some test runs, we start taking real data. &nbsp;Morale is high.<br /><br /><b>11:15</b>&nbsp;- Data coming in with no sign of stopping. &nbsp;Ryan and I head home. &nbsp;Matt has the night shift, we're to relieve him at 8 the next morning.<br /><br /><b>11:20 </b>- Discover that my bike has somehow broken while sitting on the bike rack. &nbsp;The collar that keeps the handlebars in the frame is loose, and the handlebars no longer connect with the front wheel. &nbsp;Bike is unrideable.<br /><br /><b>11:25</b>&nbsp;- Decide bike is unfixable with current tools. &nbsp;I have to walk it home.<br /><br /><b>11:40</b>&nbsp;- Home. &nbsp;Attempt to fix bike. Discover none of my wrenches are quite large enough.<br /><br /><b>11:45 </b>- Food. &nbsp;Microwave leftovers. &nbsp;Discover one of my housemates has left fresh chocolate chip cookies on the counter for the rest of the house. &nbsp;Bless her a thousand times over and eat two.<br /><br /><b><br /></b><br />Thursday 6/17<br /><b>12:15am</b>&nbsp;- Set alarm for 7:15am, and hop into bed.</p>
