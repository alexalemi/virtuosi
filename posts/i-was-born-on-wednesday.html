			<h1>I was born on&nbsp;Wednesday</h1>
			<p>Probability is a tricky thing. There are a lot of nonsensical answers to
be had. I just read <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18950-magic-numbers-a-meeting-of-mathemagical-tricksters.html?full=true">an
article</a>
about the recent <a href="http://www.g4g4.com/">Gathering for Gardner</a> meeting
that took place. Gathering for Gardner is a unique meeting for
mathematicians, magicians and puzzle makers where they get together and
talk about interesting things. The meetings were inspired by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Gardner">Martin
Gardner</a>, one of the
awesomest dudes of our time, who unfortunately just passed away. The
question put to the floor was the&nbsp;following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I have two children. One is a boy born on a Tuesday. What is the
probability I have two&nbsp;boys?&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Think about that for a moment. Not too hard though. The answer turns out
to be surprising. Upon reading the question, I thought about it for a
long time and managed to confused myself entirely. Thinking I had gone
crazy, I wrote a little python script to test the riddle, which only
left me more convinced I had gone insane. I&#8217;ve spent most of the night
thinking about it, and after making it half way to crazy, I&#8217;ve come
around and am momentarily convinced the puzzle makes perfect sense. I&#8217;m
going to attempt to convince you it makes perfect sense, but I plan on
doing it in steps so as to reduce the&nbsp;bewilderment.</p>
<h3>Playing&nbsp;Cards</h3>
<p>Forget the question. Lets play a game of cards. You shuffle a deck and
deal me two&nbsp;cards:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zCNBPs3KI/AAAAAAAAAK4/WdtzaW_A6pk/s1600/b2fv.png"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zCNBPs3KI/AAAAAAAAAK4/WdtzaW_A6pk/s320/b2fv.png" /></a><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zCNBPs3KI/AAAAAAAAAK4/WdtzaW_A6pk/s1600/b2fv.png"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zCNBPs3KI/AAAAAAAAAK4/WdtzaW_A6pk/s320/b2fv.png" /></a></p>
<p>I accidentally flip one of them&nbsp;over.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zCuZ4KiQI/AAAAAAAAALA/cNa3n-rjuTg/s1600/23.png"><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zCuZ4KiQI/AAAAAAAAALA/cNa3n-rjuTg/s320/23.png" /></a><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zCNBPs3KI/AAAAAAAAAK4/WdtzaW_A6pk/s1600/b2fv.png"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zCNBPs3KI/AAAAAAAAAK4/WdtzaW_A6pk/s320/b2fv.png" /></a></p>
<p>Whats the probability that my other card is red? Well, that ones easy,
its about half. Sure, its not exactly a half, knowing that the deck is
finite and that the draws are done without replacement, knowing that the
card showing is a red one means that there are only 52/2 - 1= 26 -1 = 25
red cards out of a deck of 52-1 = 51 cards giving a probability of 49%.
But its basically a half. Lets do over, deal me two&nbsp;cards:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zCNBPs3KI/AAAAAAAAAK4/WdtzaW_A6pk/s1600/b2fv.png"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zCNBPs3KI/AAAAAAAAAK4/WdtzaW_A6pk/s320/b2fv.png" /></a><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zCNBPs3KI/AAAAAAAAAK4/WdtzaW_A6pk/s1600/b2fv.png"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zCNBPs3KI/AAAAAAAAAK4/WdtzaW_A6pk/s320/b2fv.png" /></a></p>
<p>Darn, I flipped one of them over&nbsp;again:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zCNBPs3KI/AAAAAAAAAK4/WdtzaW_A6pk/s1600/b2fv.png"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zCNBPs3KI/AAAAAAAAAK4/WdtzaW_A6pk/s320/b2fv.png" /></a><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zDlNQLJyI/AAAAAAAAALI/WPBCX9i-Pk0/s1600/5.png"><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zDlNQLJyI/AAAAAAAAALI/WPBCX9i-Pk0/s320/5.png" /></a></p>
<p>Whats the probability that my other card is red? About a half still.<em>
(</em>Sure, this time its really 26/51 = 51%). Nothing mysterious going on.
Do over again. Deal me two&nbsp;cards:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zCNBPs3KI/AAAAAAAAAK4/WdtzaW_A6pk/s1600/b2fv.png"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zCNBPs3KI/AAAAAAAAAK4/WdtzaW_A6pk/s320/b2fv.png" /></a><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zCNBPs3KI/AAAAAAAAAK4/WdtzaW_A6pk/s1600/b2fv.png"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S_zCNBPs3KI/AAAAAAAAAK4/WdtzaW_A6pk/s320/b2fv.png" /></a></p>
<p>This time I&#8217;ll ask a little trickier question. Whats the probability
that both my cards are red? Ah, well its about 1/2 * 1/2 or about 1/4 =
25%. (The real answer is 24.5%) Alright smarty pants. Whats the
probability that I had a red card and a black one? Well, that ought to
be about 1/2 (Real answer 51%). All in all, I could have a red card,
then a black one (<span class="caps">RB</span>), or a black one, then a red one (<span class="caps">BR</span>), or a red one
then a red one (<span class="caps">RR</span>) or a black one then a black one (<span class="caps">BB</span>). 4 distinct
possibilities, each of which are equally likely, so the above two
answers make complete sense. There is only one way in four to get both
red cards, but two ways out of four to have both a red and a black. So
far so good. Lets ask a different question. Now I&#8217;m going to get a bit
obtuse. You deal me two cards. Now you ask&nbsp;me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey Alemi, do you have a red&nbsp;card?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meaning, do I have at least one red card. I respond, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Now, go with
your gut. You know I have at least one red card. What do you reckon the
color of the other one is? Probably black you say? You&#8217;d be correct.
Looking at our breakdown above, I could have gotten <span class="caps">RR</span>, <span class="caps">RB</span>, <span class="caps">BR</span>, or <span class="caps">BB</span> as
my cards dealt. Each was equally likely, but now you know something
else. You know that I have at least one red card, so we only have three
possibilities left, I either have <span class="caps">RR</span>, <span class="caps">RB</span>, or <span class="caps">BR</span>. Each of which was
equally likely. So whats the probability that my other card is black?
About 2/3 or 67%. (Real answer: 67.5%) Alright, same situation. You deal
me two cards, I reveal that I have at least one red one. Whats the
probability that my other card is red? Well, obviously 1/3 or 33%
(Actually 32.5%) since this is the opposite question to the one directly
above, and follows from the same reasoning. Fine. No problems. All of
this makes&nbsp;sense.</p>
<h3>Offspring</h3>
<p>Instead of playing cards, lets return to offspring. Lets first look at a
classic probability&nbsp;riddle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have exactly two children. At least one of them is a boy. What is
the probability that the other one is a&nbsp;boy?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If I were to give you this question straightaway, most people would have
said the probability would be a 1/2. Their reasoning being that boys and
girls are equally likely. But having just led you through the playing
cards, hopefully now it makes some sense how the true answer to this
question is 1/3 or 33%. Originally my family could have been <span class="caps">BB</span>,<span class="caps">BG</span>,<span class="caps">GB</span>,or
<span class="caps">GG</span>. Each of which was equally likely. Telling you I have at least one
boy means now we are dealing with only the situations <span class="caps">BB</span>, <span class="caps">BG</span> or <span class="caps">GB</span>,
still all equally likely, making the probability 1/3. Fine. Now, lets
reexamine the true question at&nbsp;hand:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I have two children. One is a boy born on a Tuesday. What is the
probability I have two&nbsp;boys?&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is it a half? Is it 1/3? What do you reckon? At first thought, it seems
like the Tuesday bit shouldn&#8217;t enter into it at all, but on second
thought, I&#8217;ve just revealed a lot more information than I did in the
previous question. I&#8217;ve told you something specific about one of my
children. This is analogous to when I accidently flipped over one of my
cards, revealing not only its color but its count as well. Hopefully it
makes sense that the probability ought to be much closer to a half than
to a third. In fact the answer is 13/27 = 48.1%. With a little thought,
you should be able to come up with that number yourself. Otherwise, see
<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18950-magic-numbers-a-meeting-of-mathemagical-tricksters.html?full=true">the
article</a>
I mentioned at the beginning of this post. They have a nice breakdown at
the bottom. Hopefully, at this point if you&#8217;ve read this far, you&#8217;d
should be wondering why this question was so mysterious to begin with,
and if thats the case, I did my job. If you think the question is
obvious, and think it would have been obvious even without the card
analogy, try and ask the boy-born-on-a-tuesday question by itself to one
of your friends. I guarantee they&#8217;ll be bewildered. Its a fun problem,
and one that illustrates just how strange and counterintuitive
probability can be. If you want some other mind twisting mathematical
puzzles, try your hand at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_envelopes_problem">Two envelopes
problem</a>, or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand's_box_paradox">Bertrands&#8217; box
paradox</a>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem">the
Birthday problem</a>, or
everyone&#8217;s favorite <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">the Monty Hall
problem</a>. <a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/04/some-of-best-advice-youll-ever-receive.html">Remember
though</a>,
try your hand at the problem before reading the answer. Super fun bonus
homework question: Lets do cards again. You deal me two cards, and I
reveal that I have a red heart. Whats the probability that my other card
is&nbsp;red?</p>
