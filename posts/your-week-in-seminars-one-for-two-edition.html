			<h1>Your Week in Seminars: One for Two&nbsp;Edition</h1>
			<p>Hello everyone and welcome to another week of talks here at the physics
department. I was out of Ithaca for a bit this past week, so in this
very special edition I&#8217;m going to present a full week&#8217;s worth of
seminars (one from last week and two from the previous week) in one post
covering two weeks. The Colloquium two weeks ago was given by our own
Csaba Csaki, who talked about Electroweak Symmetry Breaking and the
Physics of the TeV Scale. This was essentially an overview of
beyond-the-standard-model physics and the kind of things we expect out
of the <span class="caps">LHC</span>. Csaba started off by reminding us of the Standard Model, our
very successful model of particle physics that&#8217;s withstood nearly every
test over the last thirty or forty years. The Standard Model is a set of
three gauge theories - three forces that a relayed by massless particles
- along with the theory of electroweak symmetry breaking that explains
why one of these powers, the Weak one, is relayed by massive particles.
This theory is well-backed by experiment, with the exception of the
crucial Higgs boson, the one that gives mass to those previously
massless W and Z, which we hope to see soon in the <span class="caps">LHC</span>. There are a few
problems with the Standard Model, and the big one is the Hierarchy
problem. Given what we know of symmetry breaking and how the W and Z get
their masses, we expect elementary particles to have masses that
correlate with the energy scale of the interaction that gives them this
mass. Since that interaction is not one we see at low energies, we
expect the elementary particles to be very massive. Since they are not,
we conclude that there must be some symmetry that keeps them massless or
nearly so. Some solutions to this was mentioned, beginning with
current-favorite supersymmetry. This extra symmetry relation bosons to
fermions and vice versa works well to solve the original problem, but
creates a few of its own, like the Little Hierarchy Problem - if there&#8217;s
all this new physics at energies just a little higher than we&#8217;ve been
exploring, why don&#8217;t we see its effects on the low energy physics? In
other words, why does the non-sypersymmetry Standard Model work so well?
Csaba went on to mention some ways of solving these problems, such as
burying the Higgs by allowing it to decay only in very specific ways. He
also talked about a few more, like no-Higgs theories that accomplish
electroweak symmetry breaking by different means, and extra-dimensional
theories that allow us to give different energy scales to different
forces. And the exciting thing about all of this is that we are likely
to know a great deal of the answers soon, within the next few years,
once the <span class="caps">LHC</span> starts giving data. On Wednesday after it we had Sven
Krippendorf from Cambridge talk about Particle Physics from local
D-brane models at toric singularities. This was a heavy string theory
talk and I couldn&#8217;t follow much of it. The question at hand was how to
get the Standard Model, or parts of it, out of string theory models, and
the gist of the talk revolved around toric singularities in the
spacetime that the string theory lives in. No, I&#8217;m not entirely sure
what makes a singularity toric. There were a lot of colorful graphs and
some explanations. At the end there seemed to be some analogy made
between different types of singularities on the manifold in string
theory language and different gauge theories in the quantum field theory
language, with a way to map them to each other. Possibly exciting, but
you&#8217;d have to ask a proper string theorist about it. Then just this last
Friday, we had Rachel Rosen from Stockholm University talk about Phase
Transitions of Charged Scalars and White Dwarf Stars. This was a
blackboard talk, which is always exciting and is usually more
illustrative than Power Point ones. The subject was the thermodynamics
of white dwarf stars - stars that are very dense and old, where fusion
has mostly stopped and the only thing preventing the collapse of the
star upon itself is the fermionic pressure of the electrons, that cannot
fall into the same quantum states. The physical description of these
stars is one of relatively free positive ions, specifically helium ions
in this case, floating through a background of fermions. They are
described by a quantum condensate, which has a good theory explaining
it, but with the addition of Coulombic interaction between the ions.
This state applies, specifically, to a subgroup of these stars that are
mostly made of helium. This kind of ion condensate tends to crystallize
depending on the ratio between the kinetic and potential Coulombic
energy. Quantum effects, on the other hand, depend on some ratios of
mass and charge between the ions. The only material where this applies
turns to be helium, but luckily there are plenty of these helium-made
white dwarfs. The derivation, as Rosen showed it, starts with a neutral
Bose-Einstein condensate, which has a simple phase diagram - uncondensed
above some critical temperature, and increasing condensation as the
temperature is lowered to zero. The charged condensate introduces
photons as it is usually done in field theory and follows the
consequences. The result is a more complicated phase diagram. Under the
old Tc, the ions still condense, but things change above it. There is
now some higher temperature above which there is no condensation, but in
between there are two solutions to the equations of motions, a
condensate and a non-condensed state, and both a local energy minima.
This means that the transition into a condensate is not continuous, and
this is a first order phase transition. The nice thing here is that we
have such white dwarf stars to observe and we can compare this theory to
observations. That&#8217;s it for these last two weeks. All you Americans out
there have a good Thanksgiving, and I&#8217;ll see you next week with two new&nbsp;seminars.</p>
