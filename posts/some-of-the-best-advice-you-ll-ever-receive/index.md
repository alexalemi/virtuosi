I came across what might be the best advice any student (nay any human
being) could possibly ever receive reading a book today...

> Now there are two ways in which you can increase your understanding of

> don't leave one out. Make the set shorter or longer for convidence and
> try to understand the tradeoffs by trying to do problems with your
> choice. This is the way I would do it because I have that kind of
> personality! It's the way I study -- to understand somethingby trying
> to work it out or, in other words, to understand something by creating
> it. Not creating it one hundred percent, of course; but taking a hint
> as to which direction to go but not remembering the details. These you
> work out for yourself. The other way, which is also valuable, is to
> read carefully how someone else did it. I find the first method best
> for me, once I have understood the basic idea. If I get stuck I look
> at a book that tells me how someone else did it. I turn the pages and
> then I say "Oh, I forgot that bit", then close the book and carry on.
> Finally, after you've figured out how to do it you read how they did
> it and find out how dum your solution is and how much more clever and
> efficient theirs is! But this way you can understand the cleverness of
> their ideas and have a framework in which to think about the problem.
> When I start straight off to read someone else's solution I find it
> boring and uninteresting, with no way of putting the whole picture
> together. AT least, thats the way it works for me! Throughout the
> book, I will suggest some problems for you to play with. You might
> feel tempted to skip them. If they're too hard, fine. Some of them are

> *course* they've been done! But so what? Do them for the *fun* of it.

The quote is from none other than [Richard
Feynman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_feynman) in his [Lectures
on
Computation](http://books.google.com/books?id=-olQAAAAMAAJ&q=feynman+lectures+on+computation&dq=feynman+lectures+on+computation&ei=4dLUS4HBC43aygSIqaXoCQ&cd=1)
(a great read by the way). [reproduced without permission] Honestly I
think that's one of the biggest problems with science and math education
in this country. They have taken something which is fun and challenging,
a path of discovery, and reduced it to memorizing a list of dogmatic
equations handed down from high. Students are all but taught that the
men and women that discovered these laws are somehow above the rest of
us. One of the best kept secrets of science is that scientists are in
fact mere mortals. They have their faults, and deficiencies just like
the rest of us. You don't need anything special to do science, all you
need is a sense of curiosity and wonder, and the resolve to spend some
time working at it. The more time you work at it, the better you get.
Science is not a list of facts. It is not plugging numbers into
equations. It is neither history nor accounting. It is, in its purest
form, the recognition that as human beings we are each endowed with the
power to come to understand the world around us. I firmly believe that
anyone of a sane mind is capable of becoming a physicist. I'm not saying
that everyone should be; people should follow their passions, but I
worry that too many students are turned away thinking they aren't cut
out to be scientists, and that's rubbish. And that's my two cents.
