<p><i>Betelgeuse is a massive star at the very end of its life and could explode any second now!</i>&nbsp; Every time I hear that I get really <i>really</i> excited. &nbsp;Like a kid in a candy store that's about to see a star blow up like nobody's business. &nbsp;This giddiness will last for a solid minute before I realize that "any second now" is taken on astronomical timescales and roughly translates to "sometime in the next million years maybe possibly." &nbsp;Then I feel sad.<br /><br />But you know what always cheers me up? &nbsp;Calculating things! &nbsp;Hooray! &nbsp;So let's take a look at the ways Betelgeuse could end its life (even if it's not going to happen tomorrow) and how these would affect Earth.<br /><br /><a name='more'></a>First, a little background. &nbsp;Betelgeuse is the bright orangey-red star that sits at the head/armpit of Orion. &nbsp;It is one of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_brightest_stars">brightest</a>&nbsp;stars in the night sky. &nbsp;Its distance has been measured by the <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipparcos">Hipparcos</a>&nbsp;</i>satellite to be about 200 parsecs [1] from Earth (about 600 light years). &nbsp;Betelgeuse is&nbsp;at least 10 times as massive as our Sun and has a diameter that would easily accomodate the orbit of Mars. &nbsp;In fact, the star is big enough and close enough that it can actually be spatially resolved by the Hubble Space Telescope! &nbsp;Being so big and bright, Betelgeuse is destined to die young, going out with a bang as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova#Core_collapse">core-collapse</a>&nbsp;supernova. &nbsp;This massive explosion ejects a good deal of "star stuff" into interstellar space [2] and leaves behind either a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star">neutron star</a> or a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole">black hole</a>. <br /><br />Alright, now that we're all caught up, let's turn our focus on this "massive explosion" bit. &nbsp;What kind of energy scale are we talking about if Betelgeuse blows up? &nbsp;Well, a pretty good upper bound would be if all of the star's mass (10 solar masses worth!) were converted directly to energy, so<br /><br />[ E_{max} = mc^2 = 10M_{\odot}\times\left(\frac{2\times10^{30}~\mbox{kg}}{1~M_{\odot}}\right)\times \left(3\times10^8~\mbox{m/s}\right)^2 ]<br /><br />which is about<br /><br />[ E_{max} \sim 10^{48}~\mbox{J} ]<br /><br />and that's nothing to shake a stick at. &nbsp;But remember, this is if the <i>entire star</i>&nbsp;were converted directly to energy, and that would be hard to do. &nbsp;Typical fusion efficiencies are about ~1% [3], so let's say a reasonable estimate for the total nuclear energy available is<br /><br />[ E_{nuc} \sim \eta_{f} \times E_{max} \sim 10^{-2} \times 10^{48}~\mbox{J} \sim 10^{46}~\mbox{J}. ]<br /><br />This is the total energy released by a typical supernova. &nbsp;As it turns out though, 99% of this energy is carried away in the form of neutrinos and only about 1% is carried away in photons. &nbsp;Since we are mainly concerned with how this explosion will affect Earth, and the neutrinos will just pass on by, we will only consider the 1% of energy released in photons that would reasonably interact with Earth. &nbsp;That gives us<br /><br />[ E_{ph} \sim 0.01 \times E_{nuc} \sim 10^{44}~\mbox{J}. ]<br /><br />Neato, so that's the total amount of energy released in a supernova in the form of photons. &nbsp;How much of this energy would be deposited at the Earth if Betelgeuse exploded? &nbsp;Well, if the energy is deposited isotropically (that is, the same in all directions), then the fluence (or time integrated energy flux) is given by<br /><br />[ F_{ph} = \frac{E_{ph}}{4\pi d^2}. ]<br /><br />All this is saying is that the total energy release by the supernova spreads out uniformly over a sphere of radius d, so the fluence will give us the amount of energy deposited in each square meter of that sphere (the units of fluence here are J/m^2). &nbsp;The total energy deposited on Earth is then<br /><br />[ E_{\oplus} = F_{ph} \times \pi R^2_{\oplus}. ]<br /><br />Hot dog! &nbsp;Let's plug in some numbers, already. &nbsp;The total energy deposited on the Earth by a symmetrically exploding Betelgeuse at a distance of d = 200 pc (where 1 pc = 3 * 10^16 m) is<br /><br />[E_{\oplus}=\frac{E_{ph}}{4\pi d^2}\times\pi R^2_{\oplus}\sim 10^{19}~\mbox{J}\left(\frac{E_{ph}}{10^{44}~\mbox{J}}\right)\left(\frac{d}{200~\mbox{pc}}\right)^{-2}.]<br /><br />Well, 10^19 J certainly <i>seems</i>&nbsp;like a lot of energy. &nbsp;In fact, it is roughly the amount of energy contained in the entire nuclear arsenal of the United States [4]. &nbsp;But it is spread over the entire atmosphere. &nbsp;Is there a way to gauge how this would affect life on Earth? &nbsp;We could see how much it would heat up the atmosphere using specific heats:<br /><br />[ E = m_{atm}c_{air}\Delta T ]<br /><br />where c is the specific heat of air (~10^3 J per kg per K). &nbsp;Oops, looks like we need to know the mass of the atmosphere. &nbsp;But we can figure this out, the answer is pushing right down on our heads!<br /><br />We know the pressure at the surface of the Earth (1 atm = 101 kPa) and that pressure is just the result of the weight of the atmosphere pushing down on us. &nbsp;Since pressure is just force / area, we have<br /><br />[ P = F/A = m_{atm}g / A_{\oplus} ]<br /><br />So<br /><br />[ m_{atm} = \frac{P\times4\pi R^2_{\oplus}}{g}=\frac{10^5~\mbox{Pa}\times4\pi (6\times10^6~\mbox{m})^2}{9.8~\mbox{m/s}^2}\approx4\times10^{18}~\mbox{kg}.]<br /><br />Neato, gang. &nbsp;So we could see a temperature rise of about<br /><br />[ \Delta T = \frac{E_{ph}}{m_{atm}c_{air}}=\frac{10^{19}~\mbox{J}}{4\times10^{18}~\mbox{kg}\times10^3~\mbox{J/ kg K}}\approx0.003~\mbox{K}, ]<br /><br />or three one-thousandths of a degree. &nbsp;Remember, too, that this will be an upper bound since we are assuming that all this energy is deposited into the atmosphere before it has a chance to cool. &nbsp;In fact, if the energy is deposited over the course of hours or days, this value will be much less. <br /><br />So it looks like we've wrapped this thing up: &nbsp;Betelgeuse exploding will most certainly not put the Earth in any danger. &nbsp;Or did we? &nbsp;We have considered the case of a symmetric supernova, but there's more than one way to blow up a star. &nbsp;Massive stars can also end their lives in a fantastic explosion called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-ray_burst">gamma-ray burst</a> (GRBs to the hep cats that study them, some fun facts relegated to [5]). &nbsp;GRBs are still an intense area of current study, but the current picture (for one type of GRB, at least) is that they are the result of a star blowing up with the energy of the explosion focussed into two narrow beams (see picture below). &nbsp;Since the flux isn't distributed over the whole sphere, GRBs can be seen at much greater distances than a typical supernova. <br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-siXXiFnQWHY/TrITJA8z_sI/AAAAAAAAAPU/qStD4_9qLBI/s1600/grb.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="312" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-siXXiFnQWHY/TrITJA8z_sI/AAAAAAAAAPU/qStD4_9qLBI/s320/grb.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Example of a gamma-ray burst, with the explosion<br />in two beams.</td></tr></tbody></table><br />So how will this change our answer? &nbsp;Well, it's going to change the fluence we calculated above. &nbsp;Instead of spreading the energy out over the whole sphere, it's only going to go to some fraction of the 4pi steradians. &nbsp;So we get<br /><br />[ F_{ph} = \frac{E_{ph}}{4\pi f_{\Omega} d^2}, ]<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />where f_{omega} is called the "beaming fraction" and tells us what fraction of the sphere the energy goes through. &nbsp;Typical GRB beams range from 1 to 10 degrees in radius. &nbsp;Converting this to radians, we can find the beaming fraction as<br /><br />[ f_{\Omega} = \frac{2 \times \pi \theta^2}{4\pi} \approx 10^{-4}\left(\frac{\theta}{1^\circ}\right)^2,]<br /><br />so the beaming fraction is 10^-4 and 10^-2 for a beam angle of 1 degree and 10 degrees, respectively. &nbsp;Alright, so now we can redo the calculations we did for the supernova case, but keeping this beaming fraction around. &nbsp;The total amount of energy that would hit Earth is then about<br /><br />[E_{\oplus}=\frac{E_{ph}}{4\pi f_{\Omega} d^2}\times\pi R^2_{\oplus}\sim 10^{23}~\mbox{J}\left(\frac{E_{ph}}{10^{44}~\mbox{J}}\right)\left(\frac{d}{200~\mbox{pc}}\right)^{-2}\left(\frac{\theta}{1^\circ}\right)^{-2}.]<br /><br />Holy sixth-of-a-moley! &nbsp;Continuing as we did above, we find that this could potentially heat up the atmosphere by<br /><br />[ \Delta T = \frac{E_{ph}}{m_{atm}c_{air}}=\frac{10^{23}~\mbox{J}}{4\times10^{18}~\mbox{kg}\times10^3~\mbox{J/ kg K}}\approx3~\mbox{K}\left(\frac{\theta}{1^\circ}\right)^{-2}, ]<br /><br />which is certainly non-negligible. &nbsp;Now, this won't destroy the planet [6], but it could make things really uncomfortable. &nbsp;This will be especially true when you realize that a fair amount of the energy carried away from a gamma-ray burst is in the form of (wait for it...) gamma-rays, which will wreck havoc on your DNA. &nbsp;Remember, though, that this is an absolute worst-case scenario since we have assumed the smallest beaming angle. &nbsp;But this may still make us a little nervous, so is there anyway to figure out if Betelgeuse could, in fact, beam a gamma-ray burst towards Earth?<br /><br />Yes, yes there is. &nbsp; <br /><br />Jets and beams like those in GRBs typically point along the rotation axis of the star [7]. &nbsp;If we could determine the rotational axis of Betelgeuse, then we could say whether or not there's a chance it's pointed towards us. &nbsp;It just so happens that Betelgeuse is the only star (aside from our Sun) that is spatially resolved. &nbsp;If you could measure spectra along the star, you could look for Doppler shifting of absorption lines and say something about the velocity at the surface of the star. <br /><br />Luckily, this has already been done for us (see, for example <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998AJ....116.2501U">Uitenbroek et al. 1998</a>). &nbsp;These measurements are hard to do since the star is only a few pixels wide, but it appears as though the rotation axis is inclined to the line-of-sight by about 20 degrees (see figure below). &nbsp;That means this would require a beam with at least a 20 degree radius to hit the Earth. &nbsp;This appears to be outside the typical ranges observed. &nbsp; So even if Betelgeuse were to explode in a gamma-ray burst, the beam would miss Earth and hit some dumb other planet nobody cares about.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xYILwh0eLEM/TrSTBxflbxI/AAAAAAAAAPc/Amma1aQtmPU/s1600/rotation.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="342" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xYILwh0eLEM/TrSTBxflbxI/AAAAAAAAAPc/Amma1aQtmPU/s400/rotation.png" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Figure reproduced from Uitenbroek et al. (1998)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Alright, so the moral of the story is that Betelgeuse is completely harmless to people on Earth. &nbsp;When it does explode, it will be a brilliant supernova that would likely be visible at least a little bit during the day. &nbsp;It will be the coolest thing that anyone alive (if there are people...) will ever see. &nbsp;Sadly, this explosion could take place at just about any time during the next million years. &nbsp;Assuming a uniform distribution over this time period and a human lifetime of order 100 years, there is something like a 1 in 10,000 chance you'll see this in your life. <br /><br />Feel free to hope for a spectacular astronomical sight, but don't lose sleep worrying about being hurt by Betelgeuse!<br /><br /><br /><b>Semi-excessive Footnotes:</b><br /><br />[1] &nbsp;This has nothing to do with the Kessel Run. &nbsp;For a description of the actual distance unit see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec">Wikipedia</a>. &nbsp;For a circuitous retconning to correct for one throwaway line in <i>Star Wars</i>, see <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Kessel_Run">Wookieepedia</a>. <br /><br />[2] &nbsp;This is how anything heavier than helium gets distributed throughout the universe. &nbsp;The hydrogen and helium formed after the Big Bang gets fused into heavier elements in stars and then dispersed out through supernovae. &nbsp;In fact, most things heavier than Iron actually <i>require</i>&nbsp;supernovae to even exist. &nbsp;If you have any gold on you right now (I'm looking at you Mr. T), that only exists <i>because a star exploded!</i><br /><br />[3] &nbsp;Let's consider the case of turning 4 protons into a Helium nucleus. &nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium-4">Helium-4</a> has a binding energy of about 28 MeV, which means that the total energy of a bound He-4 nucleus is 28 MeV less than its free protons and neutrons (in other words, we need to put in 28 MeV to break it up). &nbsp;So the process of turning 4 protons into a Helium nucleus gives off 28 MeV worth of energy. &nbsp;But we had a total of 4 times 1000 MeV worth of matter we could have turned into energy. &nbsp;Thus, the process was 28 MeV/4000 MeV ~ 0.7% efficient at turning matter into energy. <br /><br />[4] &nbsp;Sometime last year, the United States <a href="http://www.defense.gov/npr/docs/10-05-03_Fact_Sheet_US_Nuclear_Transparency__FINAL_w_Date.pdf">disclosed</a>&nbsp;that its nuclear arsenal as of Sept 2009 was something like 5000 warheads. &nbsp;Assume these to be Megaton warheads. &nbsp;A Megaton is about 4 * 10^15 J, so the total energy in the US arsenal is about 5000 * 4 * 10^15 J &nbsp;= 2 * 10^19 J. <br /><br />[5] &nbsp;A fun fact about GRBs: &nbsp;They were discovered by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vela_(satellite)">military satellite</a>&nbsp;looking for illegal nuclear tests, which would emit some gamma-rays. &nbsp;Instead of seeing a signal on Earth, they saw bursts coming from space. &nbsp;I really really hope that someone's first thought was that the Russians were testing nukes on the Moon or something. &nbsp;<i>We must not allow a moon-nuke gap!</i><br /><br />[6] &nbsp;We here at the Virtuosi are contractually obligated to only destroy the Earth in our posts on Earth day. &nbsp;I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.<br /><br />[7] &nbsp;I am not exactly sure why this is the case. &nbsp;It is certainly observed to be the case and I thought there was a straightforward explanation for why this was the case, but I don't really have a good explanation. &nbsp;Although, maybe there just <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_jet">isn't a good one yet.</a><br /><br />[8] &nbsp;For comparison,&nbsp;there is about a 1 in 3000 <a href="http://www.lightningsafety.com/nlsi_pls/probability.html">chance</a> you'll be struck by lightning in your lifetime.</p>
