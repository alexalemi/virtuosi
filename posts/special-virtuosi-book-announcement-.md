We've been at this whole blogging thing for about a year now and I think
we've amassed a large and dedicated enough fanbase to finally release a
book! The track record so far for physicist-writers has been [quite
good](http://www.amazon.com/Spiral-Novel-Paul-McEuen/dp/038534211X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1301633241&sr=8-1)
of late, so we figured why not us? Well, lots of reasons actually. For
one thing, it's *really hard*. Books are, like, *hundreds* of pages
long. I barely stay coherent and on-topic in a one page blog post. For
another thing, it takes lots of time. I hardly have enough time to do my
laundry in time scales deemed "socially acceptable." How could I ever
find the time to write a book? Despite these potential setbacks, the
millions and millions of dollars that writers make still seems really
appealing. Who wouldn't want to be rich and popular forever. I mean,
just look at Oscar Wilde, Edgar Allan Poe and Herman Melville! Luckily,
a solution presented itself. I don't have time to write a book now, but
I found an old copy of my novel *Blue Dragon* laying around the house
that I was able to sell using the immense popularity of the Virtuosi
brand. The book will be published this summer by Clark Hall Publishing.
Here are a few advance reviews: *"Audacious, bodacious, entropic,
synoptic, electric, eclectic, entertaining, hyperbraining, high-roller,
tripolar... Buy*~~Against the Day~~ Blue Dragon." -- THE PHILADELPHIA
INQUIRER *"Corky isn't easy to 'get'. His melodies and chords I would
describe as complicated. But, behind all the disharmony and 11ths and so
forth.. it swings. This is my favorite Virtuosi book. It's an amazing
book and that's all you can say."* -- J.D. Jackson "*This is a book rich
in allegory and poignant social commentary. Also, you should call home
more"* -- Corky's Mom So these unbiased critics think it's totally rad.
Should you just take their word for it? Absolutely! But if you really
want see the book for yourself, here it is:
