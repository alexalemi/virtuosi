			<h1>Anatomy of an Experiment I - The&nbsp;Question</h1>

<hr />
<p>I realized the other day that I&#8217;ve seen a lot of people talk about
research results, but it is much more rare that I see someone talk about
how we do research. I think that may be because, to us as scientists,
the process is second nature. We&#8217;ve been doing it for years. Other folks
may be less familiar with the process though. With this in mind, I&#8217;m
going to do a short series of posts focused on how we do an experiment.
Not the results, not so much the physics, but the process that we go
through to create, setup, and carry out an experiment. As my example
I&#8217;ll use a short little experiment that I built from the ground up in
the last few weeks, that I&#8217;m currently in the process of (hopefully)
wrapping up. Today I&#8217;ll talk about the driving force behind almost any
experiment: The Question. It might be argued that there are two types of
experiments. There are those that set out to answer a specific question,
and those that set out to explore what happens under certain conditions
(explore some part of phase space). An example of the first type that
comes immediately to mind is the recently announced results from
<a href="http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/04may_epic/">Gravity Probe
B</a>
(<span class="caps">GP</span>-B). This was an experiment designed with one goal in mind, to test
the validity of einstein&#8217;s theory of general relativity, specifically
geodesic precession and frame dragging. They asked the question, built
the apparatus, and then got results. Here&#8217;s a spoiler from the article:
Einstein was right, to remarkable precision. I&#8217;m going to mostly ignore
the second type of experiment. While very important, I argue that those
exploratory experiments are (almost?) always done on experimental
apparatus that was built for another experiment. You don&#8217;t spend the
time, money, and energy to build an experimental apparatus without
having good evidence that it&#8217;s worth doing, that is, without expecting
to see something. This brings me to The Question. The name might be
misleading, the motivation for an experiment might not be a question
(though it can usually be phrased as one). One common motivation is to
test theoretical predictions, as was the case with <span class="caps">GP</span>-B. Theory without
experimental verification is empty. It may sound nice, but we can&#8217;t
trust it unless we&#8217;ve tested it against what nature actually does.
Sometimes theory develops because of experimental results, for example
the knowledge of the quantization of light came out of anomalous
experimental effects of the photoelectric effect and blackbody radiation
(among others). Other times, experiment develops to test theory, the
<span class="caps">GP</span>-B and the Large Hadron Collider for example. Another common
motivation is a question based on a physical observation, for example:
<a href="http://physicsbuzz.physicscentral.com/2011/04/small-insects-paddle-through-air.html">how does a fly
fly</a>?
That question is, as these things go, very simply stated. For an idea of
how complicated they can get, just take a look at any recent collection
of articles from any physics journal, wherein we find things like the
form and source of &#8216;itinerant magnetism in FeAs&#8217; (grabbed from a recent
Phys. Rev. B article). I classify a third type of question, one that is
more process based: &#8220;How can we do X?&#8221;. This third category is where the
question that motivates (at least in the broad sense) the experiment I&#8217;m
going to describe comes from. I can phrase it as: &#8220;How can we
successfully cryopreserve biological samples?&#8221; For those unfamiliar with
biological cryopreservation, this is something I discussed <a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/05/cryopreservation.html">almost a
year
ago</a>.
From there, we get into smaller questions, most of those are type two,
based on physical observations. This particular small experiment has
grown out of my work on cryopreservation, and has more to do with the
structure of water on freezing. Over the past year, one of the projects
I&#8217;ve been working on has been to measure the so called critical warming
rate of aqueous solutions. This is the rate at which you have to warm
vitreous aqueous solutions (see my earlier cryopreservation post for
more details) to prevent ice formation on warming. The question that has
grown out of this work is: how does the cooling history of my vitreous
sample affect the critical warming rate? Having arrived at the question,
we&#8217;ll next discuss the&nbsp;apparatus.</p>
