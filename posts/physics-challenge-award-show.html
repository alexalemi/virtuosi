<p>Welcome to the First Physics Challenge Problem Award Show! &nbsp;We received an integer number of solutions to our challenge problem and at long last and after much deliberation, we have chosen our winner. <br /><br />We had before indicated vaguely that there may be some sort of prizes involved in this competition. &nbsp;After consultation with our financial advisors and breaking Alemi's piggy bank, we have decided on the following prizes:<br /><br />First Place: &nbsp;A brand new CRC Handbook!<br /><br />Second Place: An autographed [1] picture of Scott Bakula!<br /><br />Honorable Mention: &nbsp;Nothing! [2]<br /><br /><a name='more'></a>So before we officially announce our winner, let's backtrack and build up some suspense. &nbsp;The challenge was to come up with a bunch of MacGyveresque experiments to determine as closely as possible the standard second, meter and kilogram using only the materials handy to you on a desert [3] island. <br /><br />Just about every response we got successfully answered the question, so we had to base our final result on robustness and uncertainties. &nbsp;We also tended to favor those that did not rest on precise knowledge of one's own height, weight, etc (though there is nothing wrong with these approaches). &nbsp;So without further ado, the winner is....<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />[pause]<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />[unnecessarily long secondary pause]<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />George from Australia! &nbsp;George provided a list of no fewer than 11 different methods for determining the second, meter and kilogram. &nbsp;The second was found by timing (by means of a pendulum) the time it takes for the sun to move through an a given angle measure. &nbsp;This measurement can be made each day for a year to get the best results (remember, you've got all the time in the world!). &nbsp;Now we have the time it takes the sun to go through a given angle measured in "swings of a pendulum." &nbsp;We can calculate the transit time of the sun into seconds and then we can find the number of seconds per swing of the pendulum. &nbsp;So now we have a second. &nbsp;But since the period of a pendulum is given by:<br /><br />[ T = 2\pi \sqrt{l/g}, ]<br /><br />we also have the length of the pendulum in meters. &nbsp;From this we can make a standard meter. &nbsp;Now all that is left is to find the kilogram. &nbsp;This can be done by making a water-tight enclosure of volume 1000 cm^3 and filling it with water, giving a kilogram that can be compared to other objects to get a longer lasting standard kilogram. &nbsp;Any other knowledge you may have (i.e. known height and weight) may be used to check the above measurements.<br /><br />A very close second place goes to Alireza, who provided a very strong submission and perhaps one of the best uses of snail mucus in the entire competition! &nbsp;Alireza's solution was to use one's own known height to construct the standard meter. &nbsp;From this you can make a pendulum to get the second and a box o' water (sealed with tar, glue and snail mucus) to get the kilogram.<br /><br />Both George and Alireza provided very detailed responses with special attention paid toward reducing uncertainty and checking their answers through several independent measurements. &nbsp;They also both carried out parts of their experiments. &nbsp;Congratulations to you both!<br /><br />In addition to the winning responses, we also received several other submissions that merit honorable mention. &nbsp;They are....<br /><br />Oliver, who provided several acoustical experiments using his SUPERPOWER of perfect pitch.<br /><br />Nicole, who noted that we were not correct in giving the Titanic the designation "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty%27s_Ship">HMS</a>" as this is reserved for ships in the British Royal Navy. &nbsp;In fact, the Titanic was designated "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Mail_Ship">RMS</a>" since it carried mail. &nbsp;Thanks, Nicole!<br /><br />Gary, who completely ignored the premise, used arbitrary units and left a very amusing note on his deathbed giving all his arbitrary units to be found and converted by the first enterprising explorer who lands on his island. &nbsp;I know you had asked for your prize in cash and while I cannot directly accomodate that wish, do know that Richard Dean Anderson smiles can be cashed in most banks nationwide (see [2]). <br /><br />So thanks to everyone who submitted a response to this Challenge. &nbsp;We enjoyed reading all of the solutions and we hope you had fun thinking about it. &nbsp;And next time you go on a boat, don't forget that CRC!<br /><br /><br />[1] &nbsp;Autograph will be signed by me on an 8.5" x 11" picture of Scott Bakula printed by a laser printer on regular copy paper.<br /><br />[2] &nbsp;Well, you receive nothing of monetary value but, know deep down in your hearts that in the picture at the top of this post, Richard Dean Anderson is smiling at you. &nbsp;So you've got that going for you, which is nice.<br /><br />[3] &nbsp;Sadly, we did not choose a dessert island. &nbsp;That would have been much more fun.</p>
