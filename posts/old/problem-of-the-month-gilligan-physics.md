So, some of us over here at Virtuosi Central have organized a challenge
problem for the physics community here at Cornell. Well, we thought we
would open up the challenge to the great wide world. The more
submissions the merrier. The deadline is March 1, and submissions can be
sent to our email. Details can be found at
[bit.ly/physicschallenge](http://bit.ly/physicschallenge). Good luck and
happy hunting.
