“problem of the week” in the subject line. We will keep track of the top
Virtuosi problem solvers.*Why did the ant cross the rubber band?**
A rubber band is held fixed at one end. The other end is pulled at a
velocity v. At time t = 0, the rubber band has a length of L, and an ant
starts crawling from one end to the other at velocity u. Does the ant
reach the other side? If so, how long does it take to get there? Assume
that the rubber band is able to be stretched indefinitely without
breaking.
