Being inspired by a Colloquium given today at Cornell by Chad Orzel over
at [Uncertain Principles](http://scienceblogs.com/principles/), I'm
going to try and resurect this old beast and begin anew. The general
plan is that I will try and read more scientific papers, translating
them into plainer english, as well as solve little problems or puzzles
that I dream up. Wish me luck, perhaps I will get some of my friends
involved.
