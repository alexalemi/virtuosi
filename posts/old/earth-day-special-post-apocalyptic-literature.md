At some point in elementary school I got into the habit of reading Franz
Kafka's [The
Metamorphosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Metamorphosis) every
time that I got sick. I found it strangely comforting to be reminded
that while I might have [scarlet
fever](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlet_fever) and be intermittently
hallucinating about Mickey Mouse, at least I had not been (spoiler
alert!) turned into a giant cockroach and disowned by my family. Today
is [Earth
Day](http://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en#q=Earth+Day&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&fp=38378e84586d88e6)!
The earth has seen better days, and I got too depressed googling various
environmental problems to even come up with a suitable list of examples.
However, look on the [bright
side](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlBiLNN1NhQ): things could be much,
much worse. To explore how much worse it could be, here's a few of my
favorite works of post-apocalyptic fiction - perfect reading for Earth
Day. Skip past the cut to check them out. In no particular order, here's
some of my favorite post-apocalyptic fiction. Many of these are aimed
more toward young adults, and since this is a science blog, I've also
tried to score them arbitrarily on their scientific plausibility (0-10).
Check out the associated amazon pages for better descriptions and
reviews.

-   [Z for
    Zachariah](http://www.amazon.com/Z-Zachariah-Robert-C-OBrien/dp/0020446500)
    - Robert C. O'Brien - Where's the best place to be when a nuclear
    war goes down? In a isolated valley in upstate New York, apparently!
    Z for Zachariah follows a 16 year old girl who is left to fend for
    herself after the bombs go off, until a Cornell chemistry postdoc
    shows up in a radiation suit. 7/10
-   [The
    Postman](http://www.amazon.com/Postman-Bantam-Classics-David-Brin/dp/0553278746/ref=pd_sim_b_3)
    - David Brin - Another in the post-nuclear war sub-genre. The story
    gets bogged down in weird survivalist themes in the second half, but
    paints a rather believable portrait of the aftermath of a nuclear
    winter. 5/10
-   [A Canticle for
    Liebowitz](http://www.amazon.com/Canticle-Leibowitz-Walter-Miller-Jr/dp/0060892994/ref=pd_sim_b_5)
    - Walter Miller - Have you ever been stuck in a waiting room at the
    dentist's and the only thing to read is a Reader's Digest from 1983?
    In the future, it's like that, only way worse. 6/10
-   [Childhood's
    End](http://www.amazon.com/Childhoods-End-Del-Rey-Impact/dp/0345444051/ref=pd_sim_b_5)
    - Aurthur C. Clark - Sometimes the end of the world is surprisingly
    zen. 3/10
-   [A Gift Upon the
    Shore](http://www.amazon.com/Gift-Upon-Shore-M-Wren/dp/0595143415/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1303485614&sr=1-1)
    - M. K. Wren - Rural Oregon also turns out to be a decent place to
    ride out a nuclear winter. Everything is great, unless your only
    surviving neighbors are fundamentalists. 7/10
-   [Emergence](http://www.amazon.com/Emergence-David-R-Palmer/dp/B002U4W1QA/ref=sr_1_8?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1303485800&sr=1-8)
    - David R. Palmer - This is probably my favorite work in this genre.
    Emergence is the diary of a very plucky Candidia Smith-Foster, who,
    along with a pet parrot, has survived a communist bio attack. Things
    get a bit nutty in the end, but overall a very enjoyable read.
    Despite great reviews it's currently out of print, although a movie
    may be in the works. 8/10
-   [I am
    Legend](http://listverse.com/2009/02/12/10-great-post-apocalyptic-science-fiction-novels/)
    - It turns out that Will Smith was actually playing an older white
    dude. Who knew? It shares strange religious overtones with the
    movie, but much better written and with a totally different ending.
    4/10
-   [The
    Pesthouse](http://www.amazon.com/Pesthouse-Vintage-Jim-Crace/dp/0307278956/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1303487441&sr=1-1)
    - Jim Crace - Society has gone a long way backwards, but they hear
    everything is better in Europe. 5/10
-   [The
    Road](http://www.amazon.com/Road-Movie-Tie--Vintage-International/dp/0307476316/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1303487550&sr=1-1)
    - Cormac McCarthy - I can't say I'm a huge fan of his writing style,
    but the world that Cormac McCarthy creates here is very compelling,
    although mind-numbingly depressing. 9/10

This is by no means an exhaustive list - there's a lot of classics that
I haven't gotten around to reading yet such as [On the
Beach.](http://www.amazon.com/Beach-Vintage-International-Nevil-Shute/dp/0307473996/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1303487212&sr=1-1)
I also have high hopes for Kim Stanley Robinson's [The Wild
Shore](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312890362?ie=UTF8&tag=jamifrat-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0312890362)
since I enjoyed his Mars series. Anyone else have anything to add? Happy
Earth Day!
