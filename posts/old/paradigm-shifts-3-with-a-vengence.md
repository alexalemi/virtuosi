The last shift I wanted to present is best explained at
[http://tauday.com/](http://tauday.com/) . There you will find a
manifesto (yes, a manifesto) about why we should change from using $$
\pi = \text{180 degrees} $$ as the circle constant to $$ \tau = 2
\pi = \text{360 degrees} $$ It's quite a convincing argument, and it's
a shift that can easily be made. Check the website for more. TAU VS PI
