<p>In the next posts, I'd like to attempt to make a camera from 'scratch.'
And by that, I mean explore the creation of cameras from their
components and then create a very primitive one from readily available
materials.</p>
<p>In terms of history and simplicity, we should start with the pinhole
camera. I've heard stories that Newton used a pinhole camera to look at
the sun though I don't know if this was before or after he stared
directly at it for 8 minutes. The pinhole is neat because it is so
simple. With a pinhole, light is focused simply by restricting the paths
which an incident ray may take to hit our film. Typically, diffuse and
specular scattering sends light bouncing every which way off an object.
The pinhole just restricts which directions hit the film. I think a
picture is a better guide to this concept.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_qY9DSyjj8Ro/TUtOYzRfZAI/AAAAAAAAB3Y/MoKfumAjRTs/s400/pinholes2.png"></p>
<p>For a small hole (aperture) there is approximately one area of the
object that will send rays to a particular part of the image. Of course
there is a very small angle of error for pinhole cameras made with
millimeter sized pins. As the hole increases in size, more rays are
incident to the same section of film. And finally, when the hole is big
enough for the whole object to be seen through it (think window), no
cohesive image is formed.</p>
<p>So if we make the hole small enough, then we can have all the clarity we
want, right? Well, I guess so. It would have to be a very circular hole
and it would only let in a very tiny amount of light making exposure
times long. How to fix this?</p>
<p>Yea, you guessed it. A lens is the answer. It is able to focus light on
its own. Now we can collect more light and still make clear images. But
the catch is that it only works for a range of distances. So again, lets
consider a lens and the images of two objects at different distances.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_qY9DSyjj8Ro/TUtO6Js1a6I/AAAAAAAAB3g/6s0Nh2XYoFY/s1600/lenses2.png"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_qY9DSyjj8Ro/TUtO6Js1a6I/AAAAAAAAB3g/6s0Nh2XYoFY/s400/lenses2.png"></a></p>
<p>Ray drawing can be done with 3 simple rules (though two are needed in
practice).</p>
<ul>
<li>rays that go in parallel to the axis go out through the focal point</li>
<li>rays that go in through the focal point go out parallel (time
    reversal symmetry)</li>
<li>rays that go through the center are not altered</li>
</ul>
<p>Using these rules, the first object which is at the proper distance for
the film position and focal length of the lens is in focus. However, the
rays from the object further away do not converge at the film and so are
out of focus.</p>
<p>Here its time for two experiments.</p>
<p>\1) <strong>The Window Camera</strong> Go to a room with a single window and cover it
with thick paper that has a single hole in it. Given enough light, you
should see an image on the far wall. If not, hold a piece of white paper
up close to the hole. [Edit: I just learned this has a name: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_obscura">camera
obscura</a>]</p>
<p>\2) <strong>The Doorway Camera</strong> Now, find a lens and a doorway. In one room,
leave the light on and go to the far wall in the dark room. Bring the
lens to the wall until you can see an image. The doorway is the
aperature, lens the lens, and wall the film. This demonstration is very
simple and not too surprising. BUT SO COOL. I encourage it <em>vigorously</em>.
The following pictures were taken of my images in case you can't find a
lens. [Edit: I guess this falls under camera obscura too]</p>

extra small image (\~1cm on a side) from the lens that will be in next
post's camera.</p>
<p>Together, these two elements – aperture and lens – make a very good
camera. The lens is able to collect a lot of light and focus it on the
film. The aperture can enhance clarity by reducing the number of paths
that light rays can take to your lens. It also provides higher order
corrections that come from the fact that the lens is probably not
perfect. That is, lenses are notorious for misbehaving around the edges
and introduce displacements in the whole image as well as between the
colors. The aperture helps keep light from traveling through these
edges.</p>
<p>Next time, a very simple camera.</p>
