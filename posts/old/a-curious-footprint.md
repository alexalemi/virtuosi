In less than two days, NASA's Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) / *Curiosity* 
rover will begin its harrowing descent to the Martian
surface. If everything goes according to the
kind-of-crazy-what-the-heck-is-a-sky-crane plan, this process will be
referred to as "landing" (otherwise, more crashy/explodey gerunds will
no doubt be used). The MSL mission is run through NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory where, by coincidence, I happen to be at the moment. Now, I'm
not working on this project, so I don't have a lot to add that
[isn't](http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/index.cfm)
[available](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2012/08/02/curiositys-chem-lab-on-mars/)
[elsewhere](http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2012/07/20/43-years-later-were-seven-minutes-away-from-a-second-great-step-forward/).
BUT I do feel an authority-by-proximity kind of fallacy kicking in, so
how about a post why not?

### Preliminaries

Before we get started, I feel obligated to link to NASA's 
*[Seven Minutes of Terror](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ki_Af_o9Q9s)*
video. If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend watching it right now (my
favorite part is the subtitles). It has over a million views on YouTube
and seems to have done a pretty good job at generating interest in the
mission. Although, it's a shame they had to interview the first guy in
what appears to be a police interrogation room. Oh well.

### About the Rover

This thing is *big*. It's the size of a car and is jam-packed with
[scientific equipment](http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/mission/instruments/). 
There's a couple different spectrometers, a bunch of cameras, a drill for
collecting rock samples, and radiation detectors. Probably the coolest
instrument onboard *Curiosity* is called the ChemCam. The ChemCam uses a
laser to vaporize small regions of rock, which allows it to study the
composition of things about 20 feet away.

In addition to the scientific payload, *Curiosity* also needs some way
to generate power. Previous rovers had been powered by solar panels, but
there don't appear to be any here. Instead, *Curiosity* is
[powered](http://www.ne.doe.gov/pdfFiles/MMRTG_Jan2008.pdf) 
by the heat released from the radioactive decay of about 10 pounds of plutonium
dioxide. This source will power the rover for 
<strike>about a Martian year</strike>
well beyond the currently planned mission duration of one Martian year
(about 687 Earth days) [Thanks to Nathan in the comments for pointing
this out!].

To summarize, the rover is a nuclear-powered lab-on-wheels that 
*shoots lasers out of its head*. This is pretty cool.

### A Curious Footprint

There's been a lot of preparation at JPL this week for the upcoming
landing. All the shiny rover models have been taken out of the visitor's
center and put in a tent outside, presumably so there will be a pretty
backdrop for press reports and the like.

Anyway, I was out taking pictures of the rovers at the end of the day
today when someone pointed out something cool about the tires on
*Curiosity*.

Here's a close-up:

Each tire on the rover is has "JPL" punched out in 
[Morse code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:International_Morse_Code.svg)!
Makes sense, though. If you're going to spend $2.5 billion on something,
you might as well put your name on it.

### Watch the Landing

If you want to watch the landing, check out the 
[NASA TV stream](http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/index.html). 
The landing is scheduled for Sunday night at 10:31 pm PDT (1:31 am EDT). Until then,
it looks like they are showing a lot of interviews and other cool
behind-the-scenes kind of stuff.
