Matt Springer over at [Built on
Fact](http://scienceblogs.com/builtonfacts/)s has a [very nice
post](http://scienceblogs.com/builtonfacts/2010/04/laser_rifle_recoil.php)
following up on my earlier analysis of [whether or not a laser gun would
recoil](http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/04/today-id-like-to-approach-question-near.html).
In my analysis I came to the conclusion that the momentum delivered was
much less than that of a conventional gun, but that the impulse, and
hence the force delivered, was about the same. However, that force was
delivered over a \~30ns timescale, which left open the question of
whether or not the wielder would be able to feel that recoil. While I
had thought to possibly return to this issue at some point, Matt has
beat me to it. This is fortuitous, because I wasn't sure quite where to
start with the question, while he approaches it in a very sensible,
clear manner. The gist of his post is that he compares our response to
short time scale forces to our ability to sense sound. I won't go
through his calculations, you can check those out for yourself, but he
concludes that it is very unlikely that we could feel the recoil of our
laser gun. Case closed. Though, like any good scientist, we may choose
to reopen it later if more evidence comes to light.
