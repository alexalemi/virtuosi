  In an emergency, Richard Dean Anderson's mullet can be used as a flotation device and/or standard kilogram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the First Physics Challenge Problem Award Show! We received
an integer number of solutions to our challenge problem and at long last
and after much deliberation, we have chosen our winner. We had before
indicated vaguely that there may be some sort of prizes involved in this
competition. After consultation with our financial advisors and breaking
Alemi's piggy bank, we have decided on the following prizes: First
Place: A brand new CRC Handbook! Second Place: An autographed [1]
picture of Scott Bakula! Honorable Mention: Nothing! [2] So before we
officially announce our winner, let's backtrack and build up some
suspense. The challenge was to come up with a bunch of MacGyveresque
experiments to determine as closely as possible the standard second,
meter and kilogram using only the materials handy to you on a desert [3]
island. Just about every response we got successfully answered the
question, so we had to base our final result on robustness and
uncertainties. We also tended to favor those that did not rest on
precise knowledge of one's own height, weight, etc (though there is
nothing wrong with these approaches). So without further ado, the winner
is.... [pause] [unnecessarily long secondary pause] George from
Australia! George provided a list of no fewer than 11 different methods
for determining the second, meter and kilogram. The second was found by
timing (by means of a pendulum) the time it takes for the sun to move
through an a given angle measure. This measurement can be made each day
for a year to get the best results (remember, you've got all the time in
the world!). Now we have the time it takes the sun to go through a given
angle measured in "swings of a pendulum." We can calculate the transit
time of the sun into seconds and then we can find the number of seconds
per swing of the pendulum. So now we have a second. But since the period
of a pendulum is given by: $$ T = 2\pi \sqrt{l/g}, $$ we also have the
length of the pendulum in meters. From this we can make a standard
meter. Now all that is left is to find the kilogram. This can be done by
making a water-tight enclosure of volume 1000 cm^3 and filling it with
water, giving a kilogram that can be compared to other objects to get a
longer lasting standard kilogram. Any other knowledge you may have (i.e.
known height and weight) may be used to check the above measurements. A
very close second place goes to Alireza, who provided a very strong
submission and perhaps one of the best uses of snail mucus in the entire
competition! Alireza's solution was to use one's own known height to
construct the standard meter. From this you can make a pendulum to get
the second and a box o' water (sealed with tar, glue and snail mucus) to
get the kilogram. Both George and Alireza provided very detailed
responses with special attention paid toward reducing uncertainty and
checking their answers through several independent measurements. They
also both carried out parts of their experiments. Congratulations to you
both! In addition to the winning responses, we also received several
other submissions that merit honorable mention. They are.... Oliver, who
provided several acoustical experiments using his SUPERPOWER of perfect
pitch. Nicole, who noted that we were not correct in giving the Titanic
the designation
"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty%27s_Ship"&gt;HMS&lt;/a&gt;" as this is
reserved for ships in the British Royal Navy. In fact, the Titanic was
designated "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Mail_Ship"&gt;RMS&lt;/a&gt;" since
it carried mail. Thanks, Nicole! Gary, who completely ignored the
premise, used arbitrary units and left a very amusing note on his
deathbed giving all his arbitrary units to be found and converted by the
first enterprising explorer who lands on his island. I know you had
asked for your prize in cash and while I cannot directly accomodate that
wish, do know that Richard Dean Anderson smiles can be cashed in most
banks nationwide (see [2]). So thanks to everyone who submitted a
response to this Challenge. We enjoyed reading all of the solutions and
we hope you had fun thinking about it. And next time you go on a boat,
don't forget that CRC! [1] Autograph will be signed by me on an 8.5" x
11" picture of Scott Bakula printed by a laser printer on regular copy
paper. [2] Well, you receive nothing of monetary value but, know deep
down in your hearts that in the picture at the top of this post, Richard
Dean Anderson is smiling at you. So you've got that going for you, which
is nice. [3] Sadly, we did not choose a dessert island. That would have
been much more fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>macguyver</category><category>physics challenge</category><category>scott bakula</category><guid>https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/old/physics-challenge-award-show/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 17 Mar 2011 23:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
