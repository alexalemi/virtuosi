&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In less than two days, NASA's Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) / &lt;em&gt;Curiosity&lt;/em&gt; 
rover will begin its harrowing descent to the Martian
surface. If everything goes according to the
kind-of-crazy-what-the-heck-is-a-sky-crane plan, this process will be
referred to as "landing" (otherwise, more crashy/explodey gerunds will
no doubt be used). The MSL mission is run through NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory where, by coincidence, I happen to be at the moment. Now, I'm
not working on this project, so I don't have a lot to add that
&lt;a href="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/index.cfm"&gt;isn't&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2012/08/02/curiositys-chem-lab-on-mars/"&gt;available&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2012/07/20/43-years-later-were-seven-minutes-away-from-a-second-great-step-forward/"&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;.
BUT I do feel an authority-by-proximity kind of fallacy kicking in, so
how about a post why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Preliminaries&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get started, I feel obligated to link to NASA's 
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ki_Af_o9Q9s"&gt;Seven Minutes of Terror&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
video. If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend watching it right now (my
favorite part is the subtitles). It has over a million views on YouTube
and seems to have done a pretty good job at generating interest in the
mission. Although, it's a shame they had to interview the first guy in
what appears to be a police interrogation room. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;About the Rover&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thing is &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt;. It's the size of a car and is jam-packed with
&lt;a href="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/mission/instruments/"&gt;scientific equipment&lt;/a&gt;. 
There's a couple different spectrometers, a bunch of cameras, a drill for
collecting rock samples, and radiation detectors. Probably the coolest
instrument onboard &lt;em&gt;Curiosity&lt;/em&gt; is called the ChemCam. The ChemCam uses a
laser to vaporize small regions of rock, which allows it to study the
composition of things about 20 feet away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the scientific payload, &lt;em&gt;Curiosity&lt;/em&gt; also needs some way
to generate power. Previous rovers had been powered by solar panels, but
there don't appear to be any here. Instead, &lt;em&gt;Curiosity&lt;/em&gt; is
&lt;a href="http://www.ne.doe.gov/pdfFiles/MMRTG_Jan2008.pdf"&gt;powered&lt;/a&gt; 
by the heat released from the radioactive decay of about 10 pounds of plutonium
dioxide. This source will power the rover for 
&lt;strike&gt;about a Martian year&lt;/strike&gt;
well beyond the currently planned mission duration of one Martian year
(about 687 Earth days) [Thanks to Nathan in the comments for pointing
this out!].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize, the rover is a nuclear-powered lab-on-wheels that 
&lt;em&gt;shoots lasers out of its head&lt;/em&gt;. This is pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure style="width:70%"&gt;

   &lt;figcaption&gt;In non-SI units, the MSL is roughly one handsome man (1 hm) tall&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;A Curious Footprint&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's been a lot of preparation at JPL this week for the upcoming
landing. All the shiny rover models have been taken out of the visitor's
center and put in a tent outside, presumably so there will be a pretty
backdrop for press reports and the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I was out taking pictures of the rovers at the end of the day
today when someone pointed out something cool about the tires on
&lt;em&gt;Curiosity&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a close-up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure style="width:70%"&gt;
  &lt;img src="https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/images/a-curious-footprint/MSL_tire.jpg" width="100%" alt="msl tire" align="center" style="margin:0px 0px 0px 0px"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt; Hole-y Tires &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each tire on the rover is has "JPL" punched out in 
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:International_Morse_Code.svg"&gt;Morse code&lt;/a&gt;!
Makes sense, though. If you're going to spend $2.5 billion on something,
you might as well put your name on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Watch the Landing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to watch the landing, check out the 
&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/index.html"&gt;NASA TV stream&lt;/a&gt;. 
The landing is scheduled for Sunday night at 10:31 pm PDT (1:31 am EDT). Until then,
it looks like they are showing a lot of interviews and other cool
behind-the-scenes kind of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>curiosity</category><category>mars</category><category>MSL</category><category>scott bakula</category><guid>https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/a-curious-footprint/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 04 Aug 2012 04:56:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
