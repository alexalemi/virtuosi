version of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel_Blotto"&gt;Colonel
Blotto&lt;/a&gt;. Well, its still up
and has been up for some time, but hasn't seen any action for a while so
I thought it might be time to take a look at the results. Colonel Blotto
is an interesting game. It seems to me, that much of this interest
derives from the fact that how well your strategy performs is very much
a function of which strategies exist in the pool. There is not a clear
cut winning strategy, you need to feel out the existing pool and adapt
accordingly. So to stir things up a little bit, in what follows I will
share some data from the existing database, refraining myself from
commenting too much. Basically, stay tuned for a bunch of pretty
pictures which will hopefully get your gears turning. The game is still
up, feel free to try to game it now that this information is out. Might
be interesting to see what kind of effect releasing the leaderboard will
have on the leaderboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Leader Board&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;347 Strategies were submitted since the game went live. Lets try and
take a look at what kind of strategies were submitted. Below are the top
25 ranking strategies in the database as of yesterday, along with the
actual strategy, its points, and full record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Soldier Distribution&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, lets try and take a look at all the strategies at once. Lets start
with the soldier distributions among the different slots. I will remind
you that the rules of the game are slot independent, i.e. if machines
were trying to play this game against one another you would expect the
soldier distribution to be more or less uniform between slots, any
deviation from uniformity probably says something deep and profound
about how humans think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrK2Sfe9zI/AAAAAAAAAM4/OTL-Nzonw54/s1600/soldierdistbox.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrK2Sfe9zI/AAAAAAAAAM4/OTL-Nzonw54/s400/soldierdistbox.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above is a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_and_whisker"&gt;box and whiskers
plot&lt;/a&gt; of all strategies,
looking at the number of soldiers in each slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFsIEnlnYPI/AAAAAAAAAOA/RjihpzKWRf0/s1600/soldierdist.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFsIEnlnYPI/AAAAAAAAAOA/RjihpzKWRf0/s400/soldierdist.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This plot is fun. It shows the full distribution of all of the
strategies. I went through the database, and for every strategy, added
one to the box that held true. I.e. for each slot (the slots are along
the x axis), the y axis marks how many strategies in the database have
that many soldiers in that slot. Should be fun to try and think about
what the non-uniformities mean. Colorbar is on the side to make the
colors quantitative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Point Distribution&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how well do all of the strategies do... lets take a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrKwJ2wATI/AAAAAAAAAMw/Zm9oCju3964/s1600/pointshist.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrKwJ2wATI/AAAAAAAAAMw/Zm9oCju3964/s400/pointshist.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above is a histogram of all the scores for all the strategies in the
database. It has some interesting features. Definitely not singly
peaked. What do you think is going on on the far left?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFsILm1CC9I/AAAAAAAAAOI/jJrgQA3xe4E/s1600/scoredist.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFsILm1CC9I/AAAAAAAAAOI/jJrgQA3xe4E/s400/scoredist.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this plot, I again went through all of the strategies in the
database, and this time, every square reflects the average score for all
strategies that have that many soldiers (y axis) in that slot (x axis).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Strategies Layout&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets drill down a bit and look at how each strategy performs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrK_cjwa6I/AAAAAAAAANA/TM0z0lXeoMA/s1600/winvlossesareatie.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrK_cjwa6I/AAAAAAAAANA/TM0z0lXeoMA/s400/winvlossesareatie.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This scatter plot has a point for each strategy in the database, the x
coordinate giving its number of wins, the y coordinate its number of
losses. The area of the circle is scaled to its number of ties, and the
color is scaled to its total score. Is there a clear trend? Why does it
fan out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLG9Jz7EI/AAAAAAAAANI/dGD2srkuJjw/s1600/winvtiearea.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLG9Jz7EI/AAAAAAAAANI/dGD2srkuJjw/s400/winvtiearea.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar plot as above but this time, x coordinate is Wins, Y is ties,
size is losses and color score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLL825x5I/AAAAAAAAANQ/ihuUuyOmoH4/s1600/lossesvtie.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLL825x5I/AAAAAAAAANQ/ihuUuyOmoH4/s400/lossesvtie.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more, this time x coordinate is losses, y is ties, color is score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Fitness Landscapes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what should you do if you wanted to design a winning strategy? Lets
first take a look at the fitness landscape. Now, this is difficult to do
for the whole game, with 10 slots and something like 40 reasonable
choices for each, this is some huge 10 dimensional space, which is
difficult to visualize, so instead lets take a look at the fitness
landscape for some lower dimensional cuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLR8oPRhI/AAAAAAAAANY/nVG1t0uisq4/s1600/energy456matshowjet.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLR8oPRhI/AAAAAAAAANY/nVG1t0uisq4/s400/energy456matshowjet.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in the above plot, what I've done is constructed a whole bunch of
strategies. First I started with 8 soldiers in all slots but the ones
listed in the title, namely slots 4,5,6 (starting with 1). So with only
3 slots free, and with the constraint that we have to have 100 soldiers
total, I can parametrize a whole bunch of strategies with only two
numbers, in this case the number of soldiers in slot 5 (x axis) and slot
6 (y axis). The color represents the score that the resulting strategy
has when run against all of the previously existing strategies in the
database. This was created without adding all of these strategies to the
database itself as that would have changed the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLVmy2N3I/AAAAAAAAANg/zID_NyC00Q0/s1600/energy568matshowjet.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLVmy2N3I/AAAAAAAAANg/zID_NyC00Q0/s400/energy568matshowjet.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar plot, this time changing the soldiers in slots 5,6 and 8 with x
axis the number of soldiers in slot 6 and the y axis the number of
soldiers in slot 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLZDDNo1I/AAAAAAAAANo/beYQagxYO6A/s1600/energy123matshowjet.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLZDDNo1I/AAAAAAAAANo/beYQagxYO6A/s400/energy123matshowjet.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another one, hopefully my labels make enough sense now that I don't have
to spell it out. I think this one has an interesting shape. What's going
on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLcW834jI/AAAAAAAAANw/Opwx0CqiqBs/s1600/energy127matshowjet.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLcW834jI/AAAAAAAAANw/Opwx0CqiqBs/s400/energy127matshowjet.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Random Strategies&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, lets say you are trying to construct winning strategies. The first
thing you might try to do is construct random strategies, by randomly
dropping 100 soldiers each into one of the slots at random. Doing so and
running these strategies against the database I got an idea of how
effective that would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLiuvLW-I/AAAAAAAAAN4/X-RmiGeA7R4/s1600/randomhist.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLiuvLW-I/AAAAAAAAAN4/X-RmiGeA7R4/s400/randomhist.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above is a histogram of the random strategies' scores. Not so good.
Looks like humans playing the game are better than randomly guessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Best Strategy?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So lets say you wanted to make the best strategy, what could you look
at? Well, for starters you might be interested in a question like the
following? 'If I put N soldiers in slot X, what percentage of the
existing strategies in the database would I beat in that slot?" The next
graph answers this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFsK-VC2qRI/AAAAAAAAAOY/UTtTyvyxhT4/s1600/strategychooserspectral.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFsK-VC2qRI/AAAAAAAAAOY/UTtTyvyxhT4/s400/strategychooserspectral.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I have attempted to show for every X,Y coordinate the following.
With Y soldiers in slot X, what percentage of the existing strategies do
you beat in slot X. I changed the color scaling to make it more refined,
so you can better read it quantitatively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Go Forth&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there you have it. You are not fueled with what is probably way more
information than you were hoping for. Hopefully these graphs are more
than just pretty, and get you thinking a bit. That is a lot of what
science is about. Make some observations and then attempt to explain the
results with your own models. You can then test your models with
experiment. I've provided you with a bunch of observations and invited
you to construct your own explinations. Now I invite you to perform an
experiment. Think you know whats going on in the game? Then try and beat
it. The link to play is the &lt;a href="http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~aalemi/blotto/index.php"&gt;same as
before&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>blotto</category><category>fun</category><category>games</category><category>graph</category><guid>https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/old/the-wrath-of-blotto/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Aug 2010 11:32:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Memorial Day Distractions</title><link>https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/old/memorial-day-distractions/</link><dc:creator>Alemi</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TAPt33D8YYI/AAAAAAAAALQ/oUokdNNFupw/s1600/manufactoria.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TAPt33D8YYI/AAAAAAAAALQ/oUokdNNFupw/s200/manufactoria.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summer is upon us. That means summer research, and online games. In
order to help you through this three day weekend and beyond, I thought
I'd share some of the more physics inspired games I've been playing
lately to pass the time. I really enjoy physics based games. When done
right, I think they can not only be fun and engaging but have the
opportunity to teach you something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Colonel Blotto&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up is a web Colonel Blotto tournament that I coded up, which you
can find
&lt;a href="http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~aalemi/blotto/index.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel_Blotto"&gt;Colonel Blotto&lt;/a&gt; is a silly
little game theoretic game where you try and assign one hundred soldiers
between 10 different fields. Opponents do the same. Neither side knows
what the other side is going to do. The game turns out to have some very
interesting dynamics. Apparently for more than 12 soldiers, the game
does not have a deterministic optimal strategy, so you're guess is as
best as mine for how to beat the other players in the pool. Its worth
checking out. Feel free to try your hand at the pool. Once the
participation has settled down, I want to try and analyze the strategies
that people employ and see if I can do any interesting statistical
physics with it. I spent a good chunk of this weekend working out the
bugs, so it should run smoothly now, but be sure to let me know if you
discover any errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Manufactoria&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This game has been sucking up a lot of my evenings lately.
&lt;a href="http://pleasingfungus.com/"&gt;Manufactoria&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most pleasing
puzzle games I've played in a long time. It pretends to be about
selecting robots that meat specification, but really its about
programming finite state machines. I've really enjoyed this game a lot.
It has a real engineering type bent, but unlike a lot of games that
require critical thinking to solve a puzzle, once you know how to solve
it, it isn't tedious to do so. A great game, and I highly recommend it.
One of the best games I've played in a while, although maybe I'm so into
it because I'm reading through &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=-olQAAAAMAAJ&amp;amp;q=feynman+lectures+on+computation&amp;amp;dq=feynman+lectures+on+computation&amp;amp;ei=qOoDTIntCqCszQSc-cyODA&amp;amp;cd=1"&gt;The Feynman Lectures on
Computation&lt;/a&gt;
right now. He gives as exercises very similar problems to the ones in
the game. Its also in regards to these types of problems specifically
that he gives &lt;a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/04/some-of-best-advice-youll-ever-receive.html"&gt;this
quote&lt;/a&gt;.
A few tips. (1) You can use asdf or the arrow keys to rotate the pieces.
(2) Space bar switches the chirality of the gates (swaps red for blue).
(3) In order to round corners, you just make the conveyors meet at a T
(4) You don't have to enter the gates on the open side. (5) During
tests, move the slider in the bottom left to the right to speed up time.
If you manage to solve all of the puzzles, three bonus ones will appear
at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Fantastic Contraption&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is old. Its been on the internet for a while now, but if you
haven't seen &lt;a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/inXile_Ent/fantastic-contraption?acomplete=fantastic"&gt;Fantastic
Contraption&lt;/a&gt;
you should check it out. Its a very free form game. You need to get the
pink block into the goal, but in order to do so, you can build any
contraption you desire out of wheels and sticks. Its a great time. Most
impressive of course is the level that some kids have taken it to. Once
you've played with the game a bit, be sure to search &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=fantastic+contraption&amp;amp;page=&amp;amp;utm_source=opensearch"&gt;youtube for
fantastic
contraption&lt;/a&gt;,
and marvel at the engineering insight some of these kids show. I like
this game a lot, but it can get a bit tedious to get your design to work
out just right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Splitter 2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is neat. As a kid I read the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Dark_Materials"&gt;His Dark
Materials&lt;/a&gt; trilogy
(which started with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Compass"&gt;The Golden
Compass&lt;/a&gt;). Anyway the
second book in the series is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Subtle_Knife"&gt;The Subtle
Knife&lt;/a&gt; which stars a
knife, the subtle knife in fact, which can cut through anything like
butter, and I mean anything, including the fabric between worlds. This
led to many day dreams as a kid, and I've spent a lot of time thinking
about what a knife like that could actually do. Anyway, &lt;a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/CasualCollective/splitter-2"&gt;Splitter
2&lt;/a&gt; is a
puzzle game that works along those lines. You have to get a ball do the
goal, but do so by cutting through pieces of wood on the stage. A neat
game. Worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Phun&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I'm hear, I can't help but mention
&lt;a href="http://www.phunland.com/wiki/Home"&gt;Phun&lt;/a&gt;. While not strictly a game.
Phun is a physics sandbox similar in style to Fantastic Contraption, but
with a whole lot more features. This one is loads of fun to play with,
and I think could really serve as a learning tool for some classes.
Worth the download. If you know of any other physics type games, drop
them in the comments. I'm always on the look out for good ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>blotto</category><category>fantastic contraption</category><category>games</category><category>manufactoria</category><category>memorial day</category><guid>https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/old/memorial-day-distractions/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 31 May 2010 13:12:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
