&lt;p&gt;I was reading a discussion on green energy recently, in particular wind
power, where the following claim was made&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;enough wind turbines to power the world would cover the surface of
the world.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this was quickly decried by supporters of wind power, but the claim
has stuck with me. The question on my mind today is: How much of the
earth's surface would have to be covered to power the earth with wind
turbines? We can't hope to put an exact number on this, the best we'll
be able to do is an order of magnitude. I also don't know much about
wind turbines, so I'll be making liberal use of
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine"&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; as I go. Let's
start with the size of the wind turbine. According to wikipedia the
largest wind turbine has a rotor sweep diameter of 128 m. To an order of
magnitude, we'll say that our average wind turbine has a diameter of 100
m. Next we need to know how much power this puts out. The maximum power
of this turbine is \~8 MW. However, it certainly wouldn't be producing
that at all times. Current wind farms produce around 20-30% maximum
capacity. However, these turbines are careful placed in areas of high
wind. We're not going to get that lucky with our wind dose when we place
our turbines haphazardly, so we'll assume they produce at 1% maximum
capacity. According to
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_energy_resources_and_consumption"&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;,
the world energy consumption in 2008 was 474 EJ (exajoules), or an
average power use in 2008 of 15 TW. To an order of magnitude then, the
area we'd have to occupy with wind turbines to power the world would be:
$$\left( \frac{(100\text{ m})^2}{1\text{
turbine}}\right)\left(\frac{1\text{ turbine}}{.01&lt;em&gt;8 \text{
MW}}\right)15 \text{TW} = 2\cdot 10^{12}\text{ m}^2$$ That's
2&lt;/em&gt;10^6 km^2, or, in english, 2 million square kilometers. For
comparison, the land area of the united states is roughly 10 millon
square kilometers. So we'd only have to cover 1/5th of the united states
with wind turbines to power the entire world (in 2008, no doubt power
use has risen since then)! While that is a lot of space taken up, it is
nowhere near the entire surface of the world. There are, of course,
&lt;a href="http://xkcd.com/556/"&gt;other concerns&lt;/a&gt; about wind power. &lt;em&gt;Note: maybe
the wind turbines are less efficient overall. Also, I assumed that the
footprint was just the square area of the turbine diameter. I know this
is the size of the face of the turbine, but to an order of magnitude I
imagine it is correct for the space occupied on the ground.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>green power</category><category>order of magnitude</category><category>wind</category><guid>https://virtuosi.alexalemi.com/posts/old/blown-away/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 24 Mar 2011 17:46:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
