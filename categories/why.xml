Hence the lack of posts. I'm
going to try to keep this one short but sweet. A lot of people think
that physics tells us why things happen. Why is the sky blue? Why does
the earth orbit the sun? Why does copper transmit electricity so well?
These all seem like perfectly reasonable questions to ask. Questions
that we, as physicists can answer. Yet, I entitled this post the
impossibility of why. In general, questions about why are not good
questions for physicists More accurately we answer questions about how.
Or what. What phenomena causes use to see the sky as blue? What forces
cause the earth to orbit the sun? How does copper transmit electricity
so well? In general, we can't answer a question of why. A friend once
asked me (at the end of a talk I gave, nonetheless) 'why can't two
electrons be in the same quantum state, while two bosons can?'. That's
an example of a question that we as physicists can't answer. We have no
idea about why that is. The best answer we can give is 'I don't know.
However, experiment tells us that's what happens.' In general, physics
cannot be built in a vacuum. We cannot sit down and write down the laws
of nature. Not without looking at nature. That is the difference between
physics and mathematics. Mathematicians can construct arbitrary logical
systems. Anything with a given set of logical axioms that is consistent
can be a valid system of mathematics. Of course, only a few are useful
systems. This allows mathematicians to generate exceedingly interesting
playgrounds for the mind. Physics is meaningless without experiment. We
have to test our theories against the world as we know it. We can no
more explain why F = ma or the Pauli exclusion principle is the way of
the world than we can answer why the universe exists. We can (at least
we hope) tell you how the world works, what to expect, cause and effect.
But why we found this particular set of rules and not another, different
but consistent system, is something we can't, and usually don't try to
answer. In many ways, I think this reduces much of the perceived
conflict between religion and science. As long as one doesn't read God's
(or gods, depending on your religion) word literally, religion is an
attempt to explain why. Physics is an attempt to explain how. There's no
inherent conflict in that. At least, that's my thinking.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>physics</category><category>why</category><guid>https://virtuosi.alexalemi.com/posts/old/the-impossibility-of-why/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2010 23:44:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
