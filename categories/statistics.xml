Between building airplanes and playfully destroying everyone else in my
apartment at Super Smash Brothers, my roommate Nathan brought up an
interesting recent fact about LeBron James. He told me that LeBron
scored 11 consecutive field goals (not in football... you know who you
are) in one game. Apparently this was a pretty special event, but how
rare is it for a player of LeBron's caliber? TO THE SCIENCE-MOBILE! The
Problem! &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHltCzuwlOs&amp;amp;feature=related"&gt;ESPN 8, The
Ocho&lt;/a&gt; tells
me that LeBron's career field goal percentage is 47.5%. Considering the
number of shots he takes, this is a pretty good number. To compare, the
highest field goal percentage for a single season was Wilt Chamberlin
with 72.7%, but eye witness testimony says he was around 10 feet tall
and would wait in the offensive paint all game. Let's see how improbable
this 11 in a row streak is. The generic question we are going to need to
answer is as follows: If a basketball player takes N shots in one game,
with a shooting probability of q, what is the probability that the
player will make AT LEAST k shots in a row? We'll call this probability
P(N) This turns out to be a tricky problem, but let's take a shot (awful
pun... I sincerely apologize). We can take care of simple cases: If N &amp;lt;
k, then P(N) = 0. This tells us you can't have a streak of k if you
don't take k shots! If N = k, P(N) = q^k. This is the probability of
getting k in a row if you take k shots, not too surprising yet. When N
&amp;gt; k, things get more interesting. Finding the Recurrence Relation Our
goal is to write a relationship that has this form: P(N) = P(N-1) +
blank What's blank? "You don't worry about blank... let me worry about
blank!" We'll need to look at the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion_exclusion_principle"&gt;inclusion-exclusion
principle&lt;/a&gt;.
This principle basically says that when we want to take all DISTINCT
items in two sets, we need to take all of the elements in one set, and
add all elements in the second set which are DISTINCT from the first.
For example, if A = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, then the
union of A and B is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. Note that I did not
include 3 and 4 twice. Let's take a look at the expertly designed (5
minutes before class) google docs drawing below:
&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/drawings/pub?id=1Ef34hZJ9mtF-GDUSpmJA4Ke2mS3BAHLsDwAk1GX19Dc&amp;amp;w=1122&amp;amp;h=485"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/pub?id=1Ef34hZJ9mtF-GDUSpmJA4Ke2mS3BAHLsDwAk1GX19Dc&amp;amp;w=1122&amp;amp;h=485"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
The entire line represents N shots being taken. Each shot gets its own
little column (not all columns shown). Using the inclusion-exclusion
principle with the following sets will give us the answer. Choose A to
be the first N-1 shots, and B to be all N shots. The principle tells us
first to take everything from A, which is the probability P(N-1) shown
in red. B will be the entire line, but the principle tells us to only
add DISTINCT chances from B. Since the only difference in B is one more
shot than A, the only distinct chance for a streak of k shots will be in
the last k shots, shown in yellow as P(k). This is only distinct if the
(k+1)th to last shot shown in green is missed! Otherwise a streak of k
would have been included in A already. There is one more place for a
streak to be already included in A. If there was a streak in the blue
section, we must not include the B streak so we don't double count.
Phew... Let's put this all together by multiplying the probabilities of
each of those events: P(N) = P(N-1) + (probability of yellow
streak)&lt;em&gt;(probability we miss green)&lt;/em&gt;(probability of no streak in blue)
$$P(N) = P(N-1) + q^k \times (1-q) \times (1 - P(N-k-1))$$ This gives
us a recurrence relation for the probabilities! This is a general
statement about the probability of at least one streak of length k out
of N chances, given each has a probability q. Since I'm just going to
plug this into Python anyway to handle the data, this equation is good
enough. The expectation value of an event is the probability multiplied
by the number of chances. For example, the expectation value of getting
heads with 2 tosses is just (1/2)*2 = 1. The plan is to compile a list
of his field goal attempts in every game LeBron has played in the NBA,
and sum the expectation values for each N. $$ \mbox{Expectation} =
\sum_i P(i) \times \mbox{(number of games with i shots)} $$ Using
LeBron's actual field goal attempt data for each game (up to February 4,
2011), we find that LeBron is expected number of games with at least a
streak of 11 in a row is 1.128. This is a higher expectation value than
the number of heads in 2 coin flips! So this is MORE expected than the
number of heads we would see with 2 coin flips. This isn't very exciting
given the number of shots he has taken and his shooting percentage. Data

&lt;p&gt;3.442E-13&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The streak in question is highlighted in red, so it appears we expect it
to happen 0.169% of his games. The Realization Of course I did all of
this before looking up the &lt;a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/truehoop/miamiheat/notebook/_/page/heatreaction-110203/miami-heat-orlando-magic"&gt;actual
article&lt;/a&gt;.
I'll quote the blurb here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LeBron James set a personal record by making his first 11 field goals
to start the game. His previous career-high was 10 straight field
goals after tip-off, recorded against Chicago in 2008. After hitting
his first 11 field goal attempts on Thursday night, James shot
6-for-14 thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well... this calculation just got a bit easier. He has played 667 games,
and the probability of getting 11 straight off the bat is q^k =
0.475^11 = 0.0002777. Multiply this by 667 games to get the expected
value of 0.185. Sure this is 6 times smaller than our previous
calculation; however it's still not statistically that impressive. How
would LeBron's expected number change if he shot the same percentage
(72.7%) as Wilt for his record breaking season? The expected number of
games with 11 in a row during the game would be 72.38 games!! So this is
incredibly dependent on the shooting percentage. We have a factor of
q^k everywhere! Certainly it's dependent on the number of shots taken
in a game too. The probability P(N) is a monotonically increasing
function! Moral Given LeBron's shooting percentage and high number of
shots per game, we expect that he would have at least 1 of these streak
of 11 games so far in his career. This is certainly not to diminish this
feat though. You still need to take 20 some shots a game in the NBA with
nearly 50% shooting accuracy! We also have a nice formula to apply to
more sports streaks! More to come...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>basketball</category><category>Bohn</category><category>lebron james</category><category>statistics</category><guid>https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/fun-fact-lebron-james-plays-basketball/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2011 12:37:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Benford's Law</title><link>https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/benford-s-law/</link><dc:creator>Corky</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Given a large set of data (bank accounts, river lengths, populations,
etc) what is the probability that the first non-zero digit is a one? My
first thought was that it would be 1/9. There are nine non-zero numbers
to choose from and they should be uniformly distributed, right? Turns
out that for almost all data sets naturally collected, this is not the
case. In most cases, one occurs as the first digit most frequently, then
two, then three, etc. That this seemingly paradoxical result should be
the case is the essence of Benford's Law. Benford's Law [1] states that
for most real-life lists of data, the first significant digit in the
data is distributed in a specific way, namely: $$ P(d) =
\mbox{log}&lt;em&gt;{10}\left(1 + \frac{1}{d}\right) $$ The probabilities
for leading digits are roughly P(1) = 0.30, P(2) = 0.18, P(3) = 0.12,
P(4) = 0.10, P(5) = 0.08, P(6) = 0.07, P(7) = 0.06, P(8) = 0.05, P(9) =
0.04. So we would expect the first significant digit to be a one almost
30% of the time! But where would such a distribution come from? Well, it
turns out that it comes from a distribution that is logarithmically
uniform. We can map the interval [1,10) to the interval [0,1) by just
taking a logarithm (base ten). These logarithms are then distributed
uniformly on the interval [0,1). We can now get some grasp for why one
should occur as the first digit more often in a uniform log
distribution. In the figure below, I have plotted 1-10 on a logarithm
scale. In a uniform log distribution, a given point is equally likely to
be found anywhere on the line. So the probability of getting any
particular first digit is just its length along that line. Clearly, the
intervals get smaller as the numbers get bigger.
&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TR4s91iaKKI/AAAAAAAAAIU/uxYE4eqknCY/s1600/logscale.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TR4s91iaKKI/AAAAAAAAAIU/uxYE4eqknCY/s400/logscale.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
But we can quantify this, too. For a first digit on the interval [1,10),
the probability that the first digit is &lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt; is given by:
$$ P(d) = \frac{\mbox{log}&lt;/em&gt;(d+1)
-\mbox{log}&lt;em&gt;{10}(d)}{\mbox{log}&lt;/em&gt;(10) -\mbox{log}&lt;em&gt;{10}(1)} $$
which is just $$ P(d) =\mbox{log}&lt;/em&gt;(d+1) -\mbox{log}&lt;em&gt;{10}(d) $$
or $$ P(d) = \mbox{log}&lt;/em&gt;\left( 1 + \frac{1}{d} \right) $$ which
is the distribution of Benford's Law. So how well do different data sets
follow Benford's Law? I decided to test it out on a couple easily
available data sets: pulsar periods, U.S. city populations, U.S. county
sizes and masses of plant genomes. Let's start first with pulsar
periods. I took 1875 pulsar periods from the ATNF Pulsar Database (found
&lt;a href="http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/psrcat/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). The results
are plotted below. The bars represent the fraction of numbers that start
with a given digit and the red dots are the fractions predicted by
Benford's Law.
&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TRpObM6LxrI/AAAAAAAAAH8/tz9WQ98H258/s1600/benford_pulsar.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TRpObM6LxrI/AAAAAAAAAH8/tz9WQ98H258/s400/benford_pulsar.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
From this plot, we see that the pulsar period data shows the general
trend of Benford's Law, but not exactly. Now let's try U.S. city
populations. This data was taken from the U.S. census bureau from the
2009 census and contains population data for over 81,000 U.S. cities. We
see from the chart below that there is a near exact correspondence
between the observed first-digit distribution and Benford's Law.
&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TRpQhzrSFmI/AAAAAAAAAIA/ZP3YTbWiiM4/s1600/benford_uscities09.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TRpQhzrSFmI/AAAAAAAAAIA/ZP3YTbWiiM4/s400/benford_uscities09.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Also from the U.S. census bureau, I got the data for the land area of
over 3000 U.S. counties. These data also conform fairly well to
Benford's Law.
&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TRpSE9pHC1I/AAAAAAAAAII/dqG382dqoCw/s1600/benford_land.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TRpSE9pHC1I/AAAAAAAAAII/dqG382dqoCw/s400/benford_land.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Finally, I found
&lt;a href="http://data.kew.org/cvalues/CvalServlet?querytype=1"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; neat website
that catalogs the genome masses of over 2000 different species of
plants. I'm not totally sure &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; they do this, but it provided a ton
of easy-to-access data, so why not?
&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TRpR82I2X1I/AAAAAAAAAIE/XdFQozbC7eY/s1600/benford_plant.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TRpR82I2X1I/AAAAAAAAAIE/XdFQozbC7eY/s400/benford_plant.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Neat, so we see that wide variety of natural data follow Benford's Law
(some more examples
&lt;a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BenfordsLaw.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). But why should
they? Well, as far as I have gathered, there are a few reasons for this.
The first two come from a paper published by Jeff Boyle [2]. Boyle makes
(and proves) two claims about this distribution. First, he claims that
"the log distribution [Benford's Law] is the limiting distribution when
random variables are repeatedly multiplied, divided, or raised to
integer powers." Second, he claims that once such a distribution is
achieved, it "persists under all further multiplications, divisions and
raising to integer powers." Since most data we accumulate (scientific,
financial, gambling,...) is the result of many mathematical operations,
we would expect that they would tend towards the logarithmic
distribution as described by Boyle. Another reason for why natural data
should fit Benford's Law is given by Roger Pinkham (in &lt;a href="http://www.williams.edu/go/math/sjmiller/public_html/BrownClasses/197/benford/Pinkham_FirstDigit.pdf"&gt;this
paper&lt;/a&gt;).
Pinkham proves that&lt;em&gt;"&lt;/em&gt;the only distribution for the first significant
digits which is invariant under scale change of the underlying
distribution" is Benford's Law. This means that if we have some data,
say the lengths of rivers in feet, it will have some distribution in the
first digit. If we require that this distribution remain the same under
unit conversion (to meters, yards, cubits, ... ), the only distribution
that satisfies this distribution would be the uniform logarithmic
distribution of Benford's Law. This "scale-invariant" rationale for this
first digit law is probably the most important when it comes to data
that we actually measure. If we find some distribution for the first
digit, we would like it to be the same no matter what units we have
used. But this should also be really easy to test. The county size data
used above was given in square miles, so let's try some new units.
First, we can try square kilometers.
&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TR09Vq1jCAI/AAAAAAAAAIM/1Yz5gp0-7CY/s1600/benford_landkm.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TR09Vq1jCAI/AAAAAAAAAIM/1Yz5gp0-7CY/s400/benford_landkm.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Slightly different than square miles, but still a very good fit. Now how
about square furlongs?
&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TR093IwIt8I/AAAAAAAAAIQ/ern61I_MJQ0/s1600/benford_landfurlong.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TR093IwIt8I/AAAAAAAAAIQ/ern61I_MJQ0/s400/benford_landfurlong.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Neat! Seems like the distribution holds true regardless of the units we
have used. So it seems like a wide range of data satisfy Benford's Law.
But is this useful in any way or is it just a statistical curiosity?
Well, it's mainly just a curiosity. But people have found some pretty
neat applications. One field in which it has found use is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_accounting"&gt;Forensic
Accounting&lt;/a&gt;, which I
can only assume is a totally rad bunch of accountants that dramatically
remove sunglasses as they go over tax returns. Since certain types of
financial data (for example, see
&lt;a href="http://www.uic.edu/classes/actg/actg593/Readings/Auditing/The-Effective-Use-Of-Benford's-Law-To-Assist-In-Detecting-Fraud-In-Accounting-Data.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)
should follow Benford's Law, inconsistencies in financial returns can be
found if the data is faked or manipulated in any way. Moral of the
story: If you're going to cook the books, remember Benford! [1]
Benford's Law, in the great tradition of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigler's_law_of_eponymy"&gt;Stigler's
Law,&lt;/a&gt; was
discovered by Simon Newcomb. [2] Paper can be found
&lt;a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/2975136"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, this is only a
