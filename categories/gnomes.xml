  Perhaps Step 2 was to steal copper?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While flipping through a CRC Handbook whose days in the United States
are dwindling, I came across a section that described the naming
conventions of each chemical element. Most of the names made sense to
me. For example, Nobelium is named after Alfred Nobel (surprise!).
However, the Nickel entry was the following: Nickel: Named after
&lt;em&gt;Satan&lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Old Nick&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This confused me greatly. What the heck is Santa
Claus doing hanging out with Satan [1]? After a bit of poking around on
the internet, I found an article from 1931 by a guy named William
Baldwin called &lt;/em&gt;The Story of Nickel, How "Old Nick's" Gnomes were
Outwitted&lt;/em&gt;. Needless to say, this did not allay my confusion. Here is
the relevant passage from the article: &lt;em&gt;In the early part of the
eighteenth century fresh lodes of ore were laid open in Saxony where
from times immemorial silver and copper mines had been worked. This new
ore was so glittering and full of promise as to cause the greatest
excitement, but after innumerable trials and endless labor all&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;that
could he obtained from the ore was a worthless metal. In disgust the
superstitious miners named the ore kupfer-nickel after "Old Nick" and
his mischievous gnomes who were charged with plaguing the miners and
bewitching the ore.&lt;/em&gt; This "worthless" metal is nickel. Kupfernickel is
the German name for the nickel ore (see image below) which comes from
the words &lt;em&gt;kupfer&lt;/em&gt;, meaning "copper" and &lt;em&gt;nickel&lt;/em&gt;, meaning "demon."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9psfFrm6qec/TZQZVPtLD0I/AAAAAAAAAK8/wyMrVWYT7Zo/s1600/niccolite.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9psfFrm6qec/TZQZVPtLD0I/AAAAAAAAAK8/wyMrVWYT7Zo/s400/niccolite.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  Ore that, if not for gnomes, would contain that sweet sweet copper&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's the story of Nickel! Tune in next time [2] for our ongoing
118-part series, &lt;em&gt;Better Know an Element!&lt;/em&gt; [1] Turns out "Old Nick" is
an English name for the Devil. Go figure. But those of you named
Nicholas should not be upset, as your name comes from the Greek
Nikholaos, which literally means "victory-people." So you've got that
going for you. [2] I have no plans of ever doing this again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>gnomes</category><category>scott bakula</category><guid>https://virtuosi.alexalemi.com/posts/old/nickel-gnomes/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 31 Mar 2011 02:17:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
