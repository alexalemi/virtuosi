As we sift through the Clicky data Corky presented yesterday, let us not
forget the Clicky that came before.
Let us not forget the Great Server Move of 2011 and the great pains we
felt while waiting for Clicky to come back to us: Corky sat in his room
crying into his pillow, Alex was pressing his arrow keys longingly, and
I just couldn't seem to get up in the morning. Let us not forget the
many hours in which untold numbers of anonymous internet users tried in
vain to spell simple words using only discrete steps on a finite
lattice. Let us not forget the Great Server Crash that caused the
physics department to be charged extra for data usage. Let us not forget
Clicky v1.0.
So today we remember him, our beloved Clicky v1.0, by releasing his data
as well. It can be found close to the other Clicky data dump from
yesterday at this location:
&lt;a href="http://www.mattbierbaum.com/clicky/clickydat2.tar.bz2"&gt;Download Clicky
v1.0&lt;/a&gt;
Be warned, this was actually available to the anonymous internet and
there are a few things that may surprise you. That being said, the last
half of this data set is actually comprised of multiple users
interacting with Clicky at once so it should have different statistics
than yesterday's data, though we have yet to sort through that too. More
of our analysis is to follow..
Also, props to whoever made the dinosaur.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>clicky</category><category>not absurdly large images</category><category>picopixels</category><guid>https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/old/clicky-data-v1-0/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 31 May 2011 11:36:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
