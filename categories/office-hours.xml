asking questions for the midterm. I'm teaching the engineering course on
optics and waves (also known as Things that go Sine) and the students
were looking at a problem dealing with quarter-wave plates. A
quarter-wave plate, the question goes, is a kind of optical instrument
that turns light with linear polarization into circular polarization.
Show, it continues, that it also turns light with circular polarization
linear. After a minute or two of discussing how a quarter-wave plate
work ("what, does it act differently on different axes?" giggled one,
and everybody gasped when I said yes) we went to the math. I wrote down
the equations for light with linear and circular polarization, $$ E_0
\hat{x} \cos\left(kz-\omega t\right) \to
\frac{E_0}{\sqrt{2}}\hat{x}\cos\left(kz-\omega t\right) +
\frac{E_0}{\sqrt{2}}\hat{y}\sin\left(kz-\omega t\right) $$ with
a little arrow in between them to signify that the quarter-wave plate
turns one into the other. This was acceptable, so we continued. What
happens when light with circular polarization enters the plate? Well, we
start out the other way:
$$\frac{E_0}{\sqrt{2}}\hat{x}\cos\left(kz-\omega t\right) +
\frac{E_0}{\sqrt{2}}\hat{y}\sin\left(kz-\omega t\right) $$ and
then break it up into components. The first term obviously behaves
exactly the same as in the previous case,
$$\frac{E_0}{\sqrt{2}}\hat{x}\cos\left(kz-\omega t\right) \to
\frac{E_0}{2}\hat{x}\cos\left(kz-\omega t\right) +
\frac{E_0}{2}\hat{y}\sin\left(kz-\omega t\right) $$ while the
second term is easy to extrapolate from there,
$$\frac{E_0}{\sqrt{2}}\hat{y}\sin\left(kz-\omega t\right) \to
-\frac{E_0}{2}\hat{x}\cos\left(kz-\omega t\right) +
\frac{E_0}{2}\hat{y}\sin\left(kz-\omega t\right) $$ and adding
them both up, we get on the other side of the quarter-wave plate
$$E_0\hat{y}\sin\left(kz-\omega t\right)$$ a linearly polarized
wave. Simple, right? Almost simple. There's one trick in there, which
you may have noticed if you were following. My student noticed it - but
she's a clever one - and she asked me why I put that minus sign in the
second transformation equation. And my honest answer was that I put it
there to get the result I wanted. Sure, I can back it up with more math
(handedness, or maybe I can figure it out by redrawing the axes) but
when I was writing those equations on the board, I put that minus sign
there because I was expecting a certain result. And really, we do this
all the time. The math isn't neutral; it's an ally (or an enemy,
sometimes) that we're bending to get the result we want - because of
intuition, because of a previous results, because this is a homework
problem with a known solution - or because we have an experimental
result that we really want to be in accord with. This isn't a problem,
necessarily. Sometimes it leads us to wrong results, sometimes it helps
us reach the correct ones. It usually makes our life easier, and
sometimes makes them a lot harder. Keeping this bias in mind when we do
our math should hopefully lead to more of the first and less of the
second.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>EM</category><category>office hours</category><guid>https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/the-malleability-of-theory/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Apr 2010 17:18:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
