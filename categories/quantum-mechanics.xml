&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine (I’ll call him Ron), who knows that I study physics, 
likes to talk to me about quantum mechanics.  He’s an easy-going guy 
and likes to joke around. “Hey, is it a particle or is it a wave today?” 
he’ll say, or, “How many dimensions do we have now?” When the conversation 
turns more serious, he tells me how he believes 
in the “quantum universe,” which is greater than what we humans are 
able to ordinarily perceive.  He talks about consciousness, immortality, 
spirits, and the great cosmic grandeur of the universe, all of which he 
ties together with the label of “quantum.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These conversations are strange to me.  Both of us are using the same two words: 
quantum mechanics.  When Ron thinks about quantum mechanics, he associates it 
with nonphysical concepts, like spirits.  Through my time spent studying physics, 
I’ve come to understand quantum mechanics as a theory describing the behavior of 
atoms and subatomic particles.
&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, one day our chatting turned to the topic of medicine and how the 
human body heals itself.  Ron told me that the biggest problem with modern 
medicine is that doctors think of the body as a physical object only. 
Healing, he said, was a “quantum” effect.  I told him that I could make a 
pretty strong physical argument for why that wasn’t the case.  He responded 
with this story:  Once, when playing football, he severely injured his knee. 
The injury was so bad that he couldn’t bend it or move it.  He didn’t have 
health insurance and didn’t have the cash on hand to pay for medical treatment. 
One day, he prayed to the universe that he would get better and a “tornado of 
light came down” and healed his leg.  Since then, Ron says, he’s always believed 
in and respected the quantum universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t tell Ron that what he described in his story didn’t happen, 
that his experience was wrong or incorrect in some way.  I wasn’t there, 
so I can’t comment on the accuracy of his narrative. And even the story 
of how his body healed out of the blue isn’t problematic: as far as I can 
tell, decades after the story took place, Ron is in good shape and his leg 
is doing fine.  What I found objectionable about the story was how, in the 
end, Ron attributed his healing to the miraculous intervention of quantum mechanics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantum mechanics, in all of its glorious strangeness, is only relevant on 
inconceivably small scales and at very, very low temperatures.  One of the 
reasons it took humans so long to develop the theory of quantum mechanics is 
that quantum effects don’t readily appear in everyday life.  My &lt;a href="http://ultracold.lassp.cornell.edu/"&gt;colleagues&lt;/a&gt;
who work to observe quantum mechanics in their experiments use lasers to manipulate 
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubidium/"&gt;atoms&lt;/a&gt; 
(objects that are 1/10,000,000,000th of a meter in size and weigh around 
1/10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000th of a kilogram) at temperatures less than 
1 Kelvin (about -459 degrees Fahrenheit).  At larger sizes and temperatures 
quantum effects are negligible.  The human body is more than a meter long, 
usually weighs around 50-100 kilograms and, if healthy, maintains a toasty 
98 degrees Fahrenheit.  Quantum mechanics is important at the atomic level, 
but on the scales at which people interact with the world it hardly shows up 
at all.  So, even if Ron's leg heals as he said it did, I wouldn't give credit to quantum mechanics.&lt;a href="https://virtuosi.alexalemi.com/posts/dtc/quantum-mechanics-mysticism/#footnote-1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span id="back_up2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been studying physics for years and still quantum mechanics 
remains utterly baffling to me.  The fact that such an abstract theory can tell us so 
much about the world feels a little bit like a miracle.  Quantum mechanics carries 
with it a number of counterintuitive ideas like the 
&lt;a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/nothing-to-see-here-demoting-the-uncertainty-principle/"&gt;uncertainty principle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://virtuosi.alexalemi.com/posts/dtc/quantum-mechanics-mysticism/#footnote-1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span id="back_up3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
entanglement, or &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation"&gt;parallel universes&lt;/a&gt;.
 These ideas are so abstracted from every day life that the subject begins to take 
 on a supernatural quality.  Physics no longer seems like physics- 
 it starts to sound like mysticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it makes sense that contemporary culture has seized upon quantum mechanics 
as a possible explanation for inexplicable things.  The theory has so many 
surprising results that it seems natural to extend it to encompass other things 
that confuse us, like questions of consciousness.  Furthermore, “quantum mechanics” 
is a term that carries with it the weight of scientific legitimacy.  If Ron had 
said that he had been healed through witchcraft, laying on of hands, or alchemy 
he would have sounded ridiculous, but attributing his experience to quantum effects 
allows the story to borrow from the credible reputation of fact-based 20th century 
science.  What my friend doesn’t realize is that terminology is not what makes 
quantum theory powerful: the scientific methodology supporting quantum mechanics 
is what matters.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to keep separate quantum mechanics the physical theory and 
quantum mechanics as a mystical cosmic principle.  Despite how confusing it 
is, quantum mechanics is an empirically motivated and mature theory that gives 
us a framework to understand physical phenomena like radiation and chemical 
bonding.  This is fundamentally different from applying quantum mechanical 
concepts to the nature of reality or consciousness.  To do so may be a fun 
philosophical parlor game, but it is baseless speculation without any evidence 
to motivate the connection between quantum mechanics and the supernatural 
that it begins with. This confusion is not just restricted to scientific laymen: there are 
trained researchers working at well-respected research institutions 
who also &lt;a href="http://www.quantumconsciousness.org/"&gt;make the same mistake&lt;/a&gt;
 my friend Ron does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, speculation that the soul, the afterlife, ESP, 
or whatever else are quantum effects is unscientific, but at least it 
isn’t dangerous or harmful in the same way as climate change denial or 
&lt;a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/health/measles-surges-uk-years-after-vaccine-scare-6C9997438/"&gt;refusing to vaccinate your children&lt;/a&gt;. 
It’s closer to something like &lt;a href="http://www.intelligentdesign.org/"&gt;intelligent design&lt;/a&gt;, which is 
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District/"&gt;fundamentally confused about what science is&lt;/a&gt;.
(We physicists are truly thankful that there is no noisy political movement 
to teach &lt;a href="https://www.deepakchopra.com/blog/view/900/from_quanta_to_qualia:_the_mystery_of_reality/"&gt;Deepak Chopra&lt;/a&gt;
alongside physics in high school classrooms.) So I won’t object to my 
friends’ stories of sudden, unexpected recoveries from illness, but 
I will react skeptically when I hear that healing has anything to do with quantum mechanics. &lt;/p&gt;

my favorite comics Randall Munroe has ever done.  That it came out while 
I was thinking about this piece was a great coincidence.  (A cosmic 
coincidence explainable through quantum entanglement?  Probably not.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p id="footnote-1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://virtuosi.alexalemi.com/posts/dtc/quantum-mechanics-mysticism/#back_up2"&gt;^&lt;/a&gt; Quantum mechanics may be just as mundane as any other materialistic physical 
theory, but that doesn’t make it any less amazing.  My favorite example is 
how quantum mechanics allows us to understand &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gS1dpowPlE8/"&gt; why the sun works. &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p id="footnote-1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://virtuosi.alexalemi.com/posts/dtc/quantum-mechanics-mysticism/#back_up3"&gt;^&lt;/a&gt; In case you didn't take the time to click on the link: Seriously, do 
yourself a favor and click on the &lt;a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/nothing-to-see-here-demoting-the-uncertainty-principle/"&gt; link &lt;/a&gt;. It's an essay from The Stone that very elegantly describes
how the uncertainty principle is far less cosmically mind-blowing than you 
may have come to believe.  It does a beautiful job bringing us back down to 
earth and carefully explaining the scope of the principle.  I must give it credit
for having inspired this piece in no small way. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;A Confession&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was recently rereading the &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=_6XvAAAAMAAJ&amp;amp;q=Feynman+lectures+on+physics&amp;amp;dq=Feynman+lectures+on+physics&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=6wmQTPzsDIG78gbAp_joDQ&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=2&amp;amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ"&gt;Feynman Lectures on
Physics&lt;/a&gt;.
If you haven't read them lately, I highly recommend them. Feynman is
always a pleasure to read. As usual, I was surprised. This time the
surprise came in lecture 9, which the way the course was laid out meant
that this was something like the last lecture in the third week that
these students had ever received of university level physics. The
lecture is on Newton's laws of dynamics. The start is of course Newton's
&lt;del&gt;first&lt;/del&gt; (second) law, $$ F = \frac{d }{dt } (mv ) $$ which, provided
the mass is constant takes the more familiar form $$ F = ma $$ After
discussing the meaning of the equation and how in general it can give
you a set of equations to solve, he naturally uses an example to
illustrate the kinds of problems you can solve. What system does he
choose to use as the first illustration of a dynamical system? The Solar
System. That's right. Let that settle for a second. The sad thing is
that if you caught me off guard before I read the lecture, caught me in
an honest moment and asked me how you would solve the solar system, I
would probably have launched into a discussion of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_problem"&gt;N-body
problem&lt;/a&gt; and how there is
no closed form solution to newtonian gravity that involves 3 or more
bodies. (Depending on who you are, I might have then mentioned the
&lt;a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1991CeMDA..50...73W"&gt;recent caveat&lt;/a&gt;,
namely that there is a closed form solution to the N-body problem, but
that it involves a very very very slowly convergent series). Now, how
can Feynman use the Solar System as his first example of solving
Newtonian dynamics and I have told you that it's impossible as my first
words on the subject? Well, the answer of course is that Feynman was
much smarter than I am. Perhaps another way to say it is that in a lot
of ways Feynman was a more contemporary physicist than I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A Realization&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physics education has changed very little in the last 50 years or so.
Now in some ways this isn't a problem. The laws of nature also haven't
changed in the last 50 years. What's unfortunate is that the tools
available to physicists to answer their questions have changed
remarkably. Namely, computers. Computers are great. They permeate daily
life nowadays. They are capable of performing millions of computations
per second. This is great for physics. You see, a lot of the time, as
you all know, the way you achieve answers to specific questions about
the evolution of a system is to do a lot of computation. So what did
physicists do before computers? Well, a lot of time they would have to
do a lot of calculations out by hand, but no one enjoys that, so a lot
of times you would have to make sacrifices, make assumptions that meant
that your analytical investigations were simple enough to yield tiddy
little equations. This is reflected in the kinds of problems we still
solve in our physics classes. I never solved the solar system in my
mechanics class. I never did it because there isn't a closed form
analytical solution to the solar system. But you know what... that
doesn't matter. It doesn't matter in the least. Because while there
doesn't exist a closed form solution to the problem, it is very easy to
come up with a numerical approximation scheme (see &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method"&gt;Euler
Method&lt;/a&gt;). You see, the point
of physics is to get answers to questions. And the fact of the matter is
that those answers don't have to be 'exact', they don't have to be
perfect. They need to be good enough that we can't tell the difference
between them being 'exact' and them being an approximation. To do this
numerically with a pad of paper and a pencil is a heroic task. Do do
this with a computer takes a couple of lines of python code and a couple
seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;An example&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example of the neat things you can do with a few lines of python
code and a few minutes on your hand, check this out.
&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wg_b8bVm8"&gt;and&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idpQOJKOh6Y"&gt;there's&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9121zwpbBs"&gt;more&lt;/a&gt; This video depicts
time dependent quantum mechanics. I set up a gaussian wavepacket, inside
of a potential that includes a hard wall on the sides and is
proportional to x. That sounds fancy but what it means is that this is
the quantum mechanics equivalent of a bouncing ball. The amplitude of
the wave function corresponds to the probability of finding the particle
at any location. That is, imagine picking one of the colored pixels at
random. If you pick any of the colored pixels at random, and look down
at the x position, that is what measuring the position of the particle
would do. But what are the colors? Quantum mechanical wave functions are
complex. This means you can represent them either with a real and
imaginary part, or with a magnitude and a phase. Here it's the latter.
Like I said the amplitude is shown with the height (actually the
amplitude squared). The color corresponds to the phase, where the phase
is mapped to a location on the color wheel, just like the one that pops
up in Photoshop or GIMP. And theres sound too! The sound is what the
wave function would sound like if it was making noise. Its the real part
of the wave function played as a sound. To that end, in this video it is
very low frequency, because I made the movie slow enough to see the
colors changing well. Its fun to watch the video and listen to the
sound. For this movie the sound correlates nicely to when the 'ball'
reaches its maximum height. Whats also cool is that you can hear the
'ball' delocalize after each bounce. The sound and function start off
being nice and sharp, but after a few bounces it starts to spread out.
You can also see how momentum is encoded in quantum mechanics. Funny
thing is that instead of being something separate that you need to
specify like in classical mechanics, in quantum mechanics the wave
function is a complete description of the evolution of the system. I.e.
if I showed you just one frame of this bouncing ball, you would be able
to recreate the entire movie. If I showed you just one frame of a
classical basketball, you'd have no idea what frame came next since
you'd only know its position, not its velocity. In quantum mechanics the
momentum gets encoded in the wave function, and as you can tell its
encoded as a complex twist. A phase gradient. A crazy rainbow. If you
look closely, you can even see that you can tell the difference between
whether the particle is falling left or right. When it goes left the
rainbow pattern goes (reading left to right) blue red green. When its
moving right it goes blue green red. It twists one way then the other in
the complex plane. The colors are a little hard to see in this one,
they're a little easier to see in this one: This second one I dressed up
a bit, labelling the axes with units, putting a time counter,
superimposing the potential I was talking about, and marking the average
expected position with a tracer black dot on the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A Call to Arms&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any student who has taken a first course in quantum mechanics knows
enough physics to make these movies. The physics isn't complicated. But
the movies really neat, right? More than neat. Making these videos
taught me things about quantum mechanics I should have learned a long
time ago. I really think computers are underestimated in physics
education. They can be a great tool. A picture is worth a thousand
words, so a movie must be worth millions&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;: denotes stolen quote
More than just as an illustrative tool, the fact that even students in
the first introductory mechanics physics course can solve for something
like the solar system shouldn't be hidden from them. Classical mechanics
after all is the physics of pretty much every object we can see and
touch, but classics mechanics classes only ever talk about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atwood_machine"&gt;Atwood
machines&lt;/a&gt; and frictionless
planes. Often the closest they come to realism is in discussing
projectile motion, where the laws you learn in the book (neglecting air
resistance) are very good at describing the trajectories of very dense
large objects (i.e. cannonballs). I can't remember the last time I've
fired a cannon. But air resistance serves little trouble to my computer.
Or &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/tag/air-resistance/"&gt;Rhett's&lt;/a&gt; (of
Dot Physics, which has just moved to Wired). Basically, if you give a
student an intro physics course and an intro programming course,
suddenly you have a human being who is better equipped to answer
questions about natural phenomenon than 99% of human beings that have
ever lived. So lets take a tip from Feynman and teach physics students
how to solve the solar system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Code&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As per request, here is the python code I used to generate the videos.
Its rather messy, so I apologize in advance.
&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B8Il0b2saix4NzYzMmRhZDUtODFhZS00YTE1LTgzZWYtMzVhODI5YzRhNWJm&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;authkey=CPrk9IUM"&gt;schrod.py&lt;/a&gt;
- A general script which finds the eigenvalues and eigenbasis for a 1D
particle with an arbitrary potential.

- Code to generate the movie. You need to create a directory with the
same name as the name in the script in the save folder as the script.
The last two lines make the sound and the directory full of images. I
used ffmpeg to wrap the two together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>bouncing ball</category><category>feynman</category><category>fun</category><category>movie</category><category>quantum mechanics</category><category>solar system</category><guid>https://virtuosi.alexalemi.com/posts/old/visualizing-quantum-mechanics/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 14 Sep 2010 20:06:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
