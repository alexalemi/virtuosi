&lt;p&gt;Summer is upon us. That means summer research, and online games. In
order to help you through this three day weekend and beyond, I thought
I'd share some of the more physics inspired games I've been playing
lately to pass the time. I really enjoy physics based games. When done
right, I think they can not only be fun and engaging but have the
opportunity to teach you something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Colonel Blotto&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up is a web Colonel Blotto tournament that I coded up, which you
can find
&lt;a href="http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~aalemi/blotto/index.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel_Blotto"&gt;Colonel Blotto&lt;/a&gt; is a silly
little game theoretic game where you try and assign one hundred soldiers
between 10 different fields. Opponents do the same. Neither side knows
what the other side is going to do. The game turns out to have some very
interesting dynamics. Apparently for more than 12 soldiers, the game
does not have a deterministic optimal strategy, so you're guess is as
best as mine for how to beat the other players in the pool. Its worth
checking out. Feel free to try your hand at the pool. Once the
participation has settled down, I want to try and analyze the strategies
that people employ and see if I can do any interesting statistical
physics with it. I spent a good chunk of this weekend working out the
bugs, so it should run smoothly now, but be sure to let me know if you
discover any errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Manufactoria&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This game has been sucking up a lot of my evenings lately.
&lt;a href="http://pleasingfungus.com/"&gt;Manufactoria&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most pleasing
puzzle games I've played in a long time. It pretends to be about
selecting robots that meat specification, but really its about
programming finite state machines. I've really enjoyed this game a lot.
It has a real engineering type bent, but unlike a lot of games that
require critical thinking to solve a puzzle, once you know how to solve
it, it isn't tedious to do so. A great game, and I highly recommend it.
One of the best games I've played in a while, although maybe I'm so into
it because I'm reading through &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=-olQAAAAMAAJ&amp;amp;q=feynman+lectures+on+computation&amp;amp;dq=feynman+lectures+on+computation&amp;amp;ei=qOoDTIntCqCszQSc-cyODA&amp;amp;cd=1"&gt;The Feynman Lectures on
Computation&lt;/a&gt;
right now. He gives as exercises very similar problems to the ones in
the game. Its also in regards to these types of problems specifically
that he gives &lt;a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/04/some-of-best-advice-youll-ever-receive.html"&gt;this
quote&lt;/a&gt;.
A few tips. (1) You can use asdf or the arrow keys to rotate the pieces.
(2) Space bar switches the chirality of the gates (swaps red for blue).
(3) In order to round corners, you just make the conveyors meet at a T
(4) You don't have to enter the gates on the open side. (5) During
tests, move the slider in the bottom left to the right to speed up time.
If you manage to solve all of the puzzles, three bonus ones will appear
at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Fantastic Contraption&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is old. Its been on the internet for a while now, but if you
haven't seen &lt;a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/inXile_Ent/fantastic-contraption?acomplete=fantastic"&gt;Fantastic
Contraption&lt;/a&gt;
you should check it out. Its a very free form game. You need to get the
pink block into the goal, but in order to do so, you can build any
contraption you desire out of wheels and sticks. Its a great time. Most
impressive of course is the level that some kids have taken it to. Once
you've played with the game a bit, be sure to search &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=fantastic+contraption&amp;amp;page=&amp;amp;utm_source=opensearch"&gt;youtube for
fantastic
contraption&lt;/a&gt;,
and marvel at the engineering insight some of these kids show. I like
this game a lot, but it can get a bit tedious to get your design to work
out just right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Splitter 2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is neat. As a kid I read the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Dark_Materials"&gt;His Dark
Materials&lt;/a&gt; trilogy
(which started with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Compass"&gt;The Golden
Compass&lt;/a&gt;). Anyway the
second book in the series is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Subtle_Knife"&gt;The Subtle
Knife&lt;/a&gt; which stars a
knife, the subtle knife in fact, which can cut through anything like
butter, and I mean anything, including the fabric between worlds. This
led to many day dreams as a kid, and I've spent a lot of time thinking
about what a knife like that could actually do. Anyway, &lt;a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/CasualCollective/splitter-2"&gt;Splitter
2&lt;/a&gt; is a
puzzle game that works along those lines. You have to get a ball do the
goal, but do so by cutting through pieces of wood on the stage. A neat
game. Worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Phun&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I'm hear, I can't help but mention
&lt;a href="http://www.phunland.com/wiki/Home"&gt;Phun&lt;/a&gt;. While not strictly a game.
Phun is a physics sandbox similar in style to Fantastic Contraption, but
with a whole lot more features. This one is loads of fun to play with,
and I think could really serve as a learning tool for some classes.
Worth the download. If you know of any other physics type games, drop
them in the comments. I'm always on the look out for good ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>blotto</category><category>fantastic contraption</category><category>games</category><category>manufactoria</category><category>memorial day</category><guid>https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/memorial-day-distractions/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 31 May 2010 13:12:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
