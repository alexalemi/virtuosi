&lt;p&gt;Let me share my worst "best idea ever" moment. Sometime during my
undergraduate I thought I had solved all the world's problems. You see,
on this fateful day, my hard drive was full. I hate it when my hard
drive fills up, it means I have to go and get rid of some of my stuff. I
hate getting rid of my stuff. But what can someone do? And then it hit
me, I had the bright idea:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we didn't have to &lt;em&gt;store&lt;/em&gt; things, what if we could just
&lt;em&gt;compute&lt;/em&gt; files whenever we wanted them back?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds like an awesome idea, right? I know. But how could we compute our
files? Well, as you may know pi is conjectured to be a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_number"&gt;normal
number&lt;/a&gt;, meaning its digits
are probably random. We also know that it is irrational, meaning pi
never ends.... Since its digits are random, and they never end, in
principle any sequence you could ever imagine should show up in pi
eventually. In fact there is a nifty website
&lt;a href="http://pi.nersc.gov/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; that will let you search for arbitrary
strings (using a 5-bit format) in first 4 billion digits, for example
"alemi" &lt;a href="http://pi.nersc.gov/cgi-bin/pi.cgi?word=alemi&amp;amp;format=char"&gt;seems to show
up&lt;/a&gt; at around
digit 3149096356. So in principle, I could send you just an index, and a
length, and you could compute the resulting file. But wait you cry,
isn't computing digits of pi hard, don't people work really hard to
compute pi farther and farther? Hold on I claim, first of all, I'm
imagining a future where computation is cheap. Secondly, there is a
really neat algorithm, the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey%E2%80%93Borwein%E2%80%93Plouffe_formula"&gt;BBP
algorithm&lt;/a&gt;,
that enables you to compute the kth binary digit of pi without knowing
any of the preceding digits. In other words, in principle if you wanted
to know the 4 billionth digit of pi, you can compute it without having
to first compute the first 4 billion other digits. Cool, this is
beginning to sound like a really good idea. What's the catch? Perhaps
you've already gotten a taste of it. Let's try to estimate just how far
along in pi we would have to look before our message of interest shows
up. Let's assume we have written our file in binary, and are computing
pi in binary e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;00100100 00111111 01101010 10001000 10000101 10100011 00001000
11010011&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;etc. So, if the sequence is random, there is a 1/2 chance that at any
point we get the right starting bit of our file, and then a 1/2 chance
we get the next one, etc. So the chance that we would create our file if
we were randomly flipping coins would be $$ P = \left( \frac{1}{2}
\right)^N = 2^{-N} $$ if our file was N bits long. So where do we
expect this sequence to first show up in the digits of pi? Well, this
turns out to be a &lt;a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CoinTossing.html"&gt;subtle
problem&lt;/a&gt;, but we can get
a feel for it by assuming that we compute N digits of pi at a time and
see if its right or not. If its not, we move on to the next group of N
digits, if its right, we're done. If this were the case, we should
expect to have to draw about $$ \frac{1}{P} = 2^N $$ times until we
have a success, and since each trial ate up N digits, we should expect
to see our file show up after about $$ N 2^N $$ digits of pi. Great, so
instead of handing you the file, I could just hand you the index the
file is located. But how many bits would I need to tell you that index.
Well, just like we know that 10^3 takes 4 digits to express in decimal,
and 6 x 10^7 takes 8 digits to express, in general it takes $$ d =
\log_b x + 1 $$ digits to express a number in base b, in this case it
takes $$ d = \log_2 ( N 2^N ) + 1= \log_2 2^N + \log_2 N + 1 = N
+ \log_2 N + 1 $$ digits to express this index in binary. And there's
the rub. Instead of sending you N bits of information contained in the
file, all my genius compression algorithm has manged to do is replace N
bits of information in the file, with a number that takes ( \~ N +
\log_2 N ) bits to express. I've actually managed to make the files
larger not smaller! You may have noticed above, that even for the simple
case of "alemi", all I managed to do was swap the binary message&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;alemi -&amp;gt; 0000101100001010110101001 with the index 3149096356 -&amp;gt;
10111011101100110110010110100100&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which is longer in binary! As an aside, you may have felt uncomfortable
with my estimation for how long we have to wait to see our message, and
you would be right. Just because all N digits I draw at a time don't
match up doesn't mean that the second half isn't useful. For instance if
I was looking for 010, lets say some of the digits are 101,010. While
both of those sequences didn't match, if I was looking at every digit at
a time, I would have found a match. And you'd be right. &lt;a href="http://www.cs.elte.hu/~mori/cikkek/Expectation.pdf"&gt;Smarter people
than I&lt;/a&gt; have
computed just how long you should have to wait, and end up with the
better estimation $$ \text{wait time} \sim 2^N N \log 2 $$ which is
pretty darn close to our silly estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>fun</category><category>pi day</category><category>probability</category><category>storage</category><guid>https://virtuosi.alexalemi.com/posts/old/pi-storage/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 14 Mar 2012 15:13:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>A Clarification</title><link>https://virtuosi.alexalemi.com/posts/old/a-clarification/</link><dc:creator>Yariv</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;As there seems to be some
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_format#Date_format"&gt;confusion&lt;/a&gt; among
my fellow Virtuosi, I wanted to point out that Pi day occurs on July
22nd or, in the year 4159, on January 3rd. Today is in fact &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waring%27s_problem"&gt;Seventh
Power Day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>day-month-year</category><category>Eurocentrism</category><category>pi day</category><guid>https://virtuosi.alexalemi.com/posts/old/a-clarification/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 14 Mar 2012 12:20:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Pi-rithmetic</title><link>https://virtuosi.alexalemi.com/posts/old/pi-rithmetic/</link><dc:creator>Alemi</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7rfL9Iby34A/T2C3LhSj_6I/AAAAAAAAAa0/rXTR30c77bk/s1600/IMAG0200.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7rfL9Iby34A/T2C3LhSj_6I/AAAAAAAAAa0/rXTR30c77bk/s320/IMAG0200.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fun fact: pi squared is very close to 10. How close? Well, &lt;a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%2810+-pi%5E2+%29%2Fpi%5E2"&gt;Wolfram
Alpha&lt;/a&gt;
tells me that it is only about 1% off. I first realized this fact when
looking at my slide rule, pictured to the left (click to embiggen), just
another reason why slide rules are awesome. It turns out I use this fact
all of the time. How's that you ask? Well, I use this fast to enable me
to do very quick mental arithmetic. It goes like this. For every number
you come across in a calculation, drop all of the information save two
parts, first, what's its order of magnitude, that is, how many digits
does it have, and second, is it closest to 1, pi, or 10? The first part
amounts to thinking of every number you come across as it looks in
scientific notation, so a number like 2342 turns into 2.342 x 10^3, so
that I've captured its magnitude in a power of 10. As for the next part,
the rules I usually use are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the remaining bit is between 1 and 2, make it 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If its between 2 and 6.5 make it pi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if its bigger than 6.5, make it another 10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to think of this is to estimate every number to be a power
of ten, and then either 1, a few, or 10. The reason I choose pi is
because if I use pi, I know how the rest of the arithmetic should work,
namely, I only need to know a few rules, plus when I use this to
estimate answers of physics formulae, making a bunch of pis show up
tends to help me cancel other natural pis that are in the formulae.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$ \pi \times \pi \sim10 \qquad \frac{1}{\pi} \sim
\frac{\pi}{10} \qquad \sqrt{10} \sim \pi $$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which you might notice is just the same approximation written in 3
different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's work an example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$ \begin{align&lt;em&gt;} 23 \times 78 / 13 \times 2133 &amp;amp;= ? \ \pi
\times 10 \times 100 / 10 \times \pi \times 10^3 &amp;amp;= ? \ \pi^2
\times 10^5 &amp;amp;\sim 10^6 \ \end{align&lt;/em&gt;}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of course the &lt;a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=23+*+78%2F13+*+2133"&gt;real
answer&lt;/a&gt; is
294,354, so you'll notice I got the answer wrong, but I only got it
wrong by a factor of 3, which is pretty good for mental arithmetic, and
in particular mental arithmetic that takes no time flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the average error I introduce by using this approximation is
just 30% or so for each number, which I've shown below [the script that
produced this plot for those interested is
&lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/2037431"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uwGlV6y_pps/T2C90lPhmQI/AAAAAAAAAbA/k_Hl8H-y2ys/s1600/pierr.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uwGlV6y_pps/T2C90lPhmQI/AAAAAAAAAbA/k_Hl8H-y2ys/s320/pierr.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there you go, now you can impress all of your friends with a simple
mental arithmetic that gets you within a factor of 3 or so on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>approximation</category><category>order of magnitude</category><category>pi day</category><category>pi-rithmetic</category><guid>https://virtuosi.alexalemi.com/posts/old/pi-rithmetic/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 14 Mar 2012 11:52:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Moving Pi-ctures</title><link>https://virtuosi.alexalemi.com/posts/old/moving-pi-ctures/</link><dc:creator>Corky</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

  My TV celebrates without me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, as I'm sure you're aware, is Pi Day - a day for the festive
consumption of pies and quiet self-reflection. In the spirit of the
holiday, I'd like to present a point for discussion: &lt;em&gt;Everyone has a
great talent for at least one thing.&lt;/em&gt; That this is true for at least
&lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; people is seen through even a cursory glance at a history book:
George Washington was really good at leading revolutions, Michelangelo
was an outstanding ceiling painter &lt;a href="https://virtuosi.alexalemi.com/posts/old/moving-pi-ctures/#note1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;, and Batman was the
best at solving complex riddles (especially in English, pero
&lt;em&gt;especialmente&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RY1U_pXUxUo&amp;amp;feature=related"&gt;en
espaÃ±ol&lt;/a&gt;).
But I'm certain that this holds for everyone. What's your talent? Mine,
as those of you who read this blog should know very well by now, is
certainly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; doing physics. Nope, my talent is watching TV. Seriously
guys, I watch TV like a boss &lt;a href="https://virtuosi.alexalemi.com/posts/old/moving-pi-ctures/#note2"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;. In light of this talent, I
thought I would describe a few instances in which I have seen pi
represented (for better or for worse) in TV and movies. Over the last
few months, I have been re-watching a lot of the TV show
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psych"&gt;Psych&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; with my good friend and
fellow Virtuosi contributor, Matt "TT" Showbiz &lt;a href="https://virtuosi.alexalemi.com/posts/old/moving-pi-ctures/#note3"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;. For the
uninitiated, &lt;em&gt;Psych&lt;/em&gt; is a detective show where the main characters
(Shawn and Gus) run a (fake) psychic detective agency, which allows them
to solve mysteries, engage in various shenanigans, and make an
inordinate number of references to &lt;em&gt;Tears for Fears&lt;/em&gt; frontman Curt Smith
&lt;a href="https://virtuosi.alexalemi.com/posts/old/moving-pi-ctures/#note4"&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;. In one of the episodes, Shawn and Gus enter a room where
a long train of digits is written across the top of the wall. It soon
becomes evident that these are the digits of pi and the camera is sure
to zoom in on the famous first few digits to reassure us. But there are
hundreds of digits written out and I have very little faith in TV prop
people when it comes to background mathematical expressions. So I
decided to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sIqwUS9wlog/T17KQ7mU7nI/AAAAAAAAAV4/1hiiMuN-yxA/s1600/pi_psych1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sIqwUS9wlog/T17KQ7mU7nI/AAAAAAAAAV4/1hiiMuN-yxA/s400/pi_psych1.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  Pi on the Wall (click to enhance for texture)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a neat little pi &lt;a href="http://www.angio.net/pi/piquery"&gt;searcher&lt;/a&gt;, I
checked to see if (and where) this sequence appeared in pi. Turns out
it's legit and (almost!) correct. The first 105 digits of pi (counting
after the three) are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510582097494459230781640628620899862803482534211706&lt;strong&gt;798&lt;/strong&gt;2148&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where I have underlined the 99th, 100th, and 101st digits. Looking back
at the writing on the wall, we see that the 100th digit has been
duplicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6vQ2gmfNULw/T17Nb29jAvI/AAAAAAAAAWA/2hMW9vdU3S0/s1600/pi_psych.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6vQ2gmfNULw/T17Nb29jAvI/AAAAAAAAAWA/2hMW9vdU3S0/s400/pi_psych.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  Very Almost Pi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So close! Oh well, nobody is perfect. Even though there is an error
here, I very much appreciate that whoever was doing the set design
decided to use the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; digits of pi. All too often I see
nonsensical equations in the background of TV shows and movies when it
would take &lt;em&gt;exactly the same&lt;/em&gt; amount of work to put real equations
there. So congratulations to you, O nameless prop-making intern!, for
giving an accurate (well, to a part in 10^100) value of pi. Neat, so
are there any other TV shows or movies that have pi in them? Well,
there's &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo18VIoR2xU"&gt;Pi&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Pi&lt;/em&gt; is film
by Darren Aronofsky (&lt;em&gt;Requiem for a Dream&lt;/em&gt;, etc) about a mathematician
looking for patterns in the stock market. It's a pretty good movie with
a really cool
&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cq_QO_4Cx4&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded"&gt;soundtrack&lt;/a&gt;
by Clint Mansell. It also appears to display the digits of pi in the
opening credits. But does it? To the Youtube-mobile! You can watch the
opening credits &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L61x5mbE-jc"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; if
you like and here is a still image of the relevant section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pEbkgRx-PFw/T17UHYdfhwI/AAAAAAAAAWI/vsyzWd139pg/s1600/sad_pi.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pEbkgRx-PFw/T17UHYdfhwI/AAAAAAAAAWI/vsyzWd139pg/s400/sad_pi.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  Pi?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks pretty cool, huh? But once we get past the slick aesthetics, we
see that something doesn't seem right. This number they are showing
appears at first glance to be our good friend pi, but after the 8th
digit the cover is blown and we see that this is actually some impostor
number!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5afmhwZOhWk/T17U-d1okrI/AAAAAAAAAWQ/KB7NHwwOvQg/s1600/verysadpi.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5afmhwZOhWk/T17U-d1okrI/AAAAAAAAAWQ/KB7NHwwOvQg/s400/verysadpi.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  More like Darren Aron-wrong-sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I fully understand that this has no bearing whatsoever on the film
and, in the grand scheme of things, is not a Big Deal. But it would have
been just as easy to put the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; digits of pi here instead of just
random filler. The only way that this could possibly be better than the
real deal would be if it is actually a secret code. I have not yet ruled
this out, as the movie is entirely about looking for meaning in
seemingly random numbers. Unfortunately, the difficulty in transcribing
the numbers from the screen greatly outweighs the very small chance that
this isn't just gibberish. Four hundred Quatloos to anyone who can tell
me if this is a code or not!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] And an above average Ninja Turtle to boot. &lt;a href="https://virtuosi.alexalemi.com/posts/old/moving-pi-ctures/#back1"&gt;[back]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2] Yes, I am putting my TV watching skills on par with the talents of
George Washington. In fact, the stoic way in which I persevered through
the entirety of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator:_The_Sarah_Connor_Chronicles"&gt;The Sarah Connor
Chronicles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;in
under two weeks was described by historian David McCullough as
"Washingtonian." These are simply facts. &lt;a href="https://virtuosi.alexalemi.com/posts/old/moving-pi-ctures/#back2"&gt;[back]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3] The extra "T" is for extra talent. &lt;a href="https://virtuosi.alexalemi.com/posts/old/moving-pi-ctures/#back3"&gt;[back]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  Rhubarb pie (Source: Wikipedia)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people know a &lt;em&gt;suspiciously&lt;/em&gt; large number of the digits of pi.
Perhaps you have met one of these people. They can typically be found
hiding behind bushes and under the counters at pastry shops, just...
&lt;em&gt;waiting&lt;/em&gt;. At the slightest hint of a mention of pi, they will jump out
and start reciting the digits like there's a prize at the end. After
rattling off numbers for a few minutes they abruptly come to an end,
grin like an idiot, and walk away. It is an unpleasant encounter. The
sheer uselessness of this kind of thing has always bothered me, so I'd
like to set a preliminary upper bound on the number of digits of pi that
could ever possibly potentially kind of be useful (maybe). For those
following along at home, now would be a good time to put on your
numerology hats. Alright, so I hear this thing pi is fairly useful when
dealing with circles. Let's say we want to make a really big circle and
have its diameter only deviate by a very small amount from the correct
value. To do this successfully, we will have to know pi fairly well.
Let's take this to extremes now. Suppose I want to put a circle around
the &lt;em&gt;entire visible universe&lt;/em&gt; such that the uncertainty in the diameter
is the size of a &lt;em&gt;single proton&lt;/em&gt;. What would be the fractional
uncertainty in the circumference in this case? If we know pi exactly,
then we have that $$\delta C = \frac{\partial C}{\partial d} \delta
d = \pi \delta d = C \frac{\delta d}{d}, $$ where d is the diameter
and C is the circumference. In other words, the fractional uncertainty
in the circumference is just $$\frac{\delta C}{C} = \frac{\delta
d}{d}. $$ Using a femtometer for the size of a proton and 90 billion
light years for the size of the Universe &lt;a href="https://virtuosi.alexalemi.com/posts/old/a-very-small-slice-of-pi/#note"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;, we get
$$\frac{\delta C}{C} = \frac{\delta d}{d} =
\frac{10^{-15}\mbox{m}}{(90\times10^9)(3\times10^7\mbox{s})(3\times10^8\mbox{m
s}^{-1})} \sim\frac{10^{-15}}{10^{27}}\sim10^{-42}.$$ Alright, so
how well do we need to know pi to get a similar fractional uncertainty?
Well, we have that $$\frac{\delta \pi}{\pi} = \frac{\delta C}{C} =
10^{-42}, $$ so we can afford an uncertainty in pi of $$ \delta \pi =
\pi \times 10^{-42}$$ and thus we'll need to know pi to about 42
digits. How's that for an
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Answer_to_the_Ultimate_Question_of_Life.2C_the_Universe.2C_and_Everything_.2842.29"&gt;answer&lt;/a&gt;?
So if we have a giant circle the size of the &lt;em&gt;entire visible universe&lt;/em&gt;,
we can find its diameter to within the size of a &lt;em&gt;single proton&lt;/em&gt; using
pi to 42 digits. Therefore, I adopt this as the maximal number of digits
that could ever prove useful in a physical sense (albeit under a
somewhat bizzarre set of circumstances). If reciting hundreds of digits
is what makes you happy, go for it. But 42 digits is more than enough pi
for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I've been concerned with the fact that I don't know many large
primes. Why? I don't know. This has led to a search for easy to remember
prime numbers. I've found a few goods ones, namely&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;867-5309 - &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/867-5309/Jenny"&gt;Jenny's
    number&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the digit 1 - 1031 times, in the style of the picture to above, and
    the largest known &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repunit_prime#Repunit_primes"&gt;repunit
    prime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1987 (my birth year), 2011 (last year), 1999 (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_(song)"&gt;the party
    year&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then I remembered that I already know 50 digits of pi, memorized one
boring day in grade school, so this got me wondering whether there were
any primes among the digits of pi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lo an behold, I wrote a &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/2033970"&gt;little
script&lt;/a&gt;, and found a few:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Found one, with 1 digits, is: 3 Found one, with 2 digits, is: 31 Found
one, with 6 digits, is: 314159 Found a rounded one with 12 digits, is:
314159265359 Found one, with 38 digits, is:
31415926535897932384626433832795028841&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it's usual for most science geeks to know pi to at least
3.14159, if you're one of those people, now you know a 6 digit prime!
