Grossman&lt;/a&gt;,
was talking about the zoology of particle physics in class the other
day. Trying to get us to remember such trivia as the mass of the B
meson, he noted that it&amp;#8217;s easier to remember two things than it is to
remember one - and as it happens, the mass of the B meson is about 5280
MeV, which is also the length of a mile in feet (an equally obscure
piece of trivia, if you ask me). This reminded of one of my first
calculus classes back home where another professor (Mikhail Sodin)
chided us for not knowing the value of e, 2.71828. This is easy to
remember, he said because 1828 is the year Lev Tolstoy was born. Then
again, when I came to write this post, I could neither remember e, nor
Tolstoy&amp;#8217;s year of birth - or even that it was Tolstoy, rather than
Dostoevsky or some other Russian author. So perhaps two things are not
easier to remember than one after&amp;nbsp;all.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Yariv</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2010 16:32:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2010-09-02:posts/remembering-two-things.html</guid><category>class</category><category>particle physics</category><category>shorts</category></item></channel></rss>
