been meaning to post about the Japan nuclear crisis for a few days. The
various major news outlets are doing a good job, or so it seems, of
keeping us informed of the events going on over there. However, I found
myself rather puzzled over the physics of what was happening. From the
news articles I was unable to figure out what was actually causing the
meltdown, beyond some problem with the cooling. As a postdoc in my lab
asked, &amp;#8220;Isn&amp;#8217;t all they have to do drop the control rods and the reaction
ends?&amp;#8221; So I decided to do a little digging. I&amp;#8217;ve found a couple of
places that do a nice job of explain some of the physics of what is
actually happening, &lt;a href="http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2011/03/fukushima_crisis_anatomy_of_a.html"&gt;nature
news&lt;/a&gt;
(not sure if the nature blogs are behind a paywall), and &lt;a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=fukushima-core"&gt;scientific
american&lt;/a&gt;
(not up on current events, but a nice summary of what can/might go
wrong). I&amp;#8217;m sure there are many other places doing a good job of
explaining things, but these are the ones and I found, and hopefully
they help clarify what is actually&amp;nbsp;happening.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jesse</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 16 Mar 2011 10:36:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2011-03-16:posts/japan-nuclear-crisis.html</guid><category>crisis</category><category>physics</category><category>nuclear</category><category>japan</category></item></channel></rss>
