In my analysis I came to the conclusion that the momentum delivered was much less than that of a conventional gun, but that the impulse, and hence the force delivered, was about the same.  However, that force was delivered over a ~30ns timescale, which left open the question of whether or not the wielder would be able to feel that&amp;nbsp;recoil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I had thought to possibly return to this issue at some point, Matt has beat me to it.  This is fortuitous, because I wasn&amp;#8217;t sure quite where to start with the question, while he approaches it in a very sensible, clear manner.  The gist of his post is that he compares our response to short time scale forces to our ability to sense sound.  I won&amp;#8217;t go through his calculations, you can check those out for yourself, but he concludes that it is very unlikely that we could feel the recoil of our laser&amp;nbsp;gun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case closed.  Though, like any good scientist, we may choose to reopen it later if more evidence comes to&amp;nbsp;light.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="recoil"></category><category term="laser"></category><category term="sound"></category><category term="momentum"></category><category term="gun"></category></entry></feed>
