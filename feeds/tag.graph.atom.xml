version of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel_Blotto"&gt;Colonel
Blotto&lt;/a&gt;. Well, its still up
and has been up for some time, but hasn&amp;#8217;t seen any action for a while so
I thought it might be time to take a look at the results. Colonel Blotto
is an interesting game. It seems to me, that much of this interest
derives from the fact that how well your strategy performs is very much
a function of which strategies exist in the pool. There is not a clear
cut winning strategy, you need to feel out the existing pool and adapt
accordingly. So to stir things up a little bit, in what follows I will
share some data from the existing database, refraining myself from
commenting too much. Basically, stay tuned for a bunch of pretty
pictures which will hopefully get your gears turning. The game is still
up, feel free to try to game it now that this information is out. Might
be interesting to see what kind of effect releasing the leaderboard will
have on the&amp;nbsp;leaderboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Leader&amp;nbsp;Board&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;347 Strategies were submitted since the game went live. Lets try and
take a look at what kind of strategies were submitted. Below are the top
25 ranking strategies in the database as of yesterday, along with the
actual strategy, its points, and full&amp;nbsp;record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Soldier&amp;nbsp;Distribution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, lets try and take a look at all the strategies at once. Lets start
with the soldier distributions among the different slots. I will remind
you that the rules of the game are slot independent, i.e. if machines
were trying to play this game against one another you would expect the
soldier distribution to be more or less uniform between slots, any
deviation from uniformity probably says something deep and profound
about how humans&amp;nbsp;think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrK2Sfe9zI/AAAAAAAAAM4/OTL-Nzonw54/s1600/soldierdistbox.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrK2Sfe9zI/AAAAAAAAAM4/OTL-Nzonw54/s400/soldierdistbox.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above is a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_and_whisker"&gt;box and whiskers
plot&lt;/a&gt; of all strategies,
looking at the number of soldiers in each&amp;nbsp;slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFsIEnlnYPI/AAAAAAAAAOA/RjihpzKWRf0/s1600/soldierdist.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFsIEnlnYPI/AAAAAAAAAOA/RjihpzKWRf0/s400/soldierdist.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This plot is fun. It shows the full distribution of all of the
strategies. I went through the database, and for every strategy, added
one to the box that held true. I.e. for each slot (the slots are along
the x axis), the y axis marks how many strategies in the database have
that many soldiers in that slot. Should be fun to try and think about
what the non-uniformities mean. Colorbar is on the side to make the
colors&amp;nbsp;quantitative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Point&amp;nbsp;Distribution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how well do all of the strategies do&amp;#8230; lets take a&amp;nbsp;look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrKwJ2wATI/AAAAAAAAAMw/Zm9oCju3964/s1600/pointshist.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrKwJ2wATI/AAAAAAAAAMw/Zm9oCju3964/s400/pointshist.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above is a histogram of all the scores for all the strategies in the
database. It has some interesting features. Definitely not singly
peaked. What do you think is going on on the far&amp;nbsp;left?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFsILm1CC9I/AAAAAAAAAOI/jJrgQA3xe4E/s1600/scoredist.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFsILm1CC9I/AAAAAAAAAOI/jJrgQA3xe4E/s400/scoredist.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this plot, I again went through all of the strategies in the
database, and this time, every square reflects the average score for all
strategies that have that many soldiers (y axis) in that slot (x&amp;nbsp;axis).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Strategies&amp;nbsp;Layout&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets drill down a bit and look at how each strategy&amp;nbsp;performs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrK_cjwa6I/AAAAAAAAANA/TM0z0lXeoMA/s1600/winvlossesareatie.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrK_cjwa6I/AAAAAAAAANA/TM0z0lXeoMA/s400/winvlossesareatie.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This scatter plot has a point for each strategy in the database, the x
coordinate giving its number of wins, the y coordinate its number of
losses. The area of the circle is scaled to its number of ties, and the
color is scaled to its total score. Is there a clear trend? Why does it
fan&amp;nbsp;out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLG9Jz7EI/AAAAAAAAANI/dGD2srkuJjw/s1600/winvtiearea.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLG9Jz7EI/AAAAAAAAANI/dGD2srkuJjw/s400/winvtiearea.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar plot as above but this time, x coordinate is Wins, Y is ties,
size is losses and color&amp;nbsp;score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLL825x5I/AAAAAAAAANQ/ihuUuyOmoH4/s1600/lossesvtie.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLL825x5I/AAAAAAAAANQ/ihuUuyOmoH4/s400/lossesvtie.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more, this time x coordinate is losses, y is ties, color is&amp;nbsp;score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fitness&amp;nbsp;Landscapes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what should you do if you wanted to design a winning strategy? Lets
first take a look at the fitness landscape. Now, this is difficult to do
for the whole game, with 10 slots and something like 40 reasonable
choices for each, this is some huge 10 dimensional space, which is
difficult to visualize, so instead lets take a look at the fitness
landscape for some lower dimensional&amp;nbsp;cuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLR8oPRhI/AAAAAAAAANY/nVG1t0uisq4/s1600/energy456matshowjet.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLR8oPRhI/AAAAAAAAANY/nVG1t0uisq4/s400/energy456matshowjet.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in the above plot, what I&amp;#8217;ve done is constructed a whole bunch of
strategies. First I started with 8 soldiers in all slots but the ones
listed in the title, namely slots 4,5,6 (starting with 1). So with only
3 slots free, and with the constraint that we have to have 100 soldiers
total, I can parametrize a whole bunch of strategies with only two
numbers, in this case the number of soldiers in slot 5 (x axis) and slot
6 (y axis). The color represents the score that the resulting strategy
has when run against all of the previously existing strategies in the
database. This was created without adding all of these strategies to the
database itself as that would have changed the&amp;nbsp;results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLVmy2N3I/AAAAAAAAANg/zID_NyC00Q0/s1600/energy568matshowjet.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLVmy2N3I/AAAAAAAAANg/zID_NyC00Q0/s400/energy568matshowjet.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar plot, this time changing the soldiers in slots 5,6 and 8 with x
axis the number of soldiers in slot 6 and the y axis the number of
soldiers in slot&amp;nbsp;8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLZDDNo1I/AAAAAAAAANo/beYQagxYO6A/s1600/energy123matshowjet.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLZDDNo1I/AAAAAAAAANo/beYQagxYO6A/s400/energy123matshowjet.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another one, hopefully my labels make enough sense now that I don&amp;#8217;t have
to spell it out. I think this one has an interesting shape. What&amp;#8217;s going&amp;nbsp;on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLcW834jI/AAAAAAAAANw/Opwx0CqiqBs/s1600/energy127matshowjet.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLcW834jI/AAAAAAAAANw/Opwx0CqiqBs/s400/energy127matshowjet.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Random&amp;nbsp;Strategies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, lets say you are trying to construct winning strategies. The first
thing you might try to do is construct random strategies, by randomly
dropping 100 soldiers each into one of the slots at random. Doing so and
running these strategies against the database I got an idea of how
effective that would&amp;nbsp;be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLiuvLW-I/AAAAAAAAAN4/X-RmiGeA7R4/s1600/randomhist.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLiuvLW-I/AAAAAAAAAN4/X-RmiGeA7R4/s400/randomhist.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above is a histogram of the random strategies&amp;#8217; scores. Not so good.
Looks like humans playing the game are better than randomly&amp;nbsp;guessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Best&amp;nbsp;Strategy?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So lets say you wanted to make the best strategy, what could you look
at? Well, for starters you might be interested in a question like the
following? &amp;#8216;If I put N soldiers in slot X, what percentage of the
existing strategies in the database would I beat in that slot?&amp;#8221; The next
graph answers this&amp;nbsp;question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFsK-VC2qRI/AAAAAAAAAOY/UTtTyvyxhT4/s1600/strategychooserspectral.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFsK-VC2qRI/AAAAAAAAAOY/UTtTyvyxhT4/s400/strategychooserspectral.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I have attempted to show for every X,Y coordinate the following.
With Y soldiers in slot X, what percentage of the existing strategies do
you beat in slot X. I changed the color scaling to make it more refined,
so you can better read it&amp;nbsp;quantitatively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Go&amp;nbsp;Forth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there you have it. You are not fueled with what is probably way more
information than you were hoping for. Hopefully these graphs are more
than just pretty, and get you thinking a bit. That is a lot of what
science is about. Make some observations and then attempt to explain the
results with your own models. You can then test your models with
experiment. I&amp;#8217;ve provided you with a bunch of observations and invited
you to construct your own explinations. Now I invite you to perform an
experiment. Think you know whats going on in the game? Then try and beat
it. The link to play is the &lt;a href="http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~aalemi/blotto/index.php"&gt;same as
before&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="games"></category><category term="fun"></category><category term="blotto"></category><category term="graph"></category></entry><entry><title>Steak Dinner</title><link href="http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/steak-dinner.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-08-03T21:20:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Alemi</name></author><id>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2010-08-03:posts/steak-dinner.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sorry about the blog hiatus. During the summer, without teaching
classes, inspiration is harder to come by. But, tonight I cooked a
steak. I recently got a new digital meat thermometer. My plan was to
slowly cook the steak until the internal temperature got to be about 140
degrees Fahrenheit with the oven at 200 degrees, take it out, wrap in
tin foil, crank the oven to 500 degrees, stick it back in, and give it a
nice exterior, reaching an internal temperature of about 150 degrees
which would put it at about medium. After I put the steak into the oven
though, I started to watch the temperature go up on my digital
thermometer and thought, why not take data. And so I did. Here are the&amp;nbsp;results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFi924poROI/AAAAAAAAAMg/VSSuNTCh30g/s1600/steakdinner.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFi924poROI/AAAAAAAAAMg/VSSuNTCh30g/s400/steakdinner.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above you see the internal temperature of the steak as a function of
time. First some comments about the&amp;nbsp;graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The steak started at 37 degrees, the temperature of my&amp;nbsp;refrigerator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t start taking data until about 20 minutes&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The red dashed lines mark where I turned up the temperature of the
    oven. It started at 200 degrees, then 250, then 300, and in the
    final stretch, 500 with the&amp;nbsp;broiler.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The green dotted lines mark where I got impatient and opened the
    door to the over to check on the&amp;nbsp;food.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The yellow background denotes where the steak was outside of the
    oven resting in&amp;nbsp;tinfoil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now some comments on the&amp;nbsp;data&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can clearly see a change in the data when I changed the oven&amp;nbsp;temperature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opening the oven door really seems to slow down the cooking&amp;nbsp;process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The temperature of the center of the steak continues to rise after
    you take it out of the&amp;nbsp;oven.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In fact, curiously enough, the temperature of the center of the
    steak seems to have risen the quickest after it was taken out of the&amp;nbsp;oven.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I decided to look at the heating rate, computed by taking the
finite differences of my data points and propagating the&amp;nbsp;errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFi97yIEe9I/AAAAAAAAAMo/EzZ_kvRdb7U/s1600/heatrate.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFi97yIEe9I/AAAAAAAAAMo/EzZ_kvRdb7U/s400/heatrate.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you&amp;#8217;ll see, I really didn&amp;#8217;t have enough data points or a precise
enough thermometer to really see the changes in the heating rate.
Finally some comments about the&amp;nbsp;food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The steak was good. You&amp;#8217;ll notice I shot past 150, ended up with a
    temperature of about 160, and a steak that was nearly medium&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cooking the steak slowly like this yielded as pretty soft texture,
    akin to a roast. Heck, I essentially roasted the&amp;nbsp;steak.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The steak was served with asparagus and baked potatoes. As an
    interesting aside, the baked potatoes were in the oven along with
    the steak the whole time, but did not cook all the way through. I
    normally bake potatoes at 350 for about an hour, and here they were
    in a hot oven for over an hour and a half, half an hour of which was
    above 300, but they didn&amp;#8217;t cook&amp;nbsp;through.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I clearly have too much time on my hands. I have one more steak, and I
think I&amp;#8217;ll try a different cooking method. Maybe I&amp;#8217;ll have the patience
