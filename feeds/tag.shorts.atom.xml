Trying to get us to remember such trivia as the mass of the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt; meson, he noted that it&amp;#8217;s easier to remember two things than it is to remember one - and as it happens, the mass of the B meson is about 5280 MeV, which is also the length of a mile in feet (an equally obscure piece of trivia, if you ask&amp;nbsp;me).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reminded of one of my first calculus classes  back home where another professor (Mikhail Sodin) chided us for not knowing the value of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;, 2.71828. This is easy to remember, he said because 1828 is the year Lev Tolstoy was&amp;nbsp;born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then again, when I came to write this post, I could neither remember &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;, nor Tolstoy&amp;#8217;s year of birth - or even that it was Tolstoy, rather than Dostoevsky or some other Russian author. So perhaps two things are not easier to remember than one after&amp;nbsp;all.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="class"></category><category term="particle physics"></category><category term="shorts"></category></entry></feed>
