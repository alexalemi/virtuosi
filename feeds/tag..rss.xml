&lt;p&gt;Since December 2012 is coming up, I thought I'd help the Mayans out with a look at a possible end of the world scenario. (I know, it's not Earth Day yet, but we at the Virtuosi can only go so long without fantasizing about wanton destruction.) As the Earth zips around the Sun, it moves through the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliosphere"&gt;heliosphere&lt;/a&gt;, which is a collection of charged particles emitted by the Sun. Like any other fluid, this will exert drag on the Earth, slowly causing it to spiral into the Sun. Eventually, it will burn in a blaze of glory, in a bad-action-movie combination of Sunshine meets Armageddon.
&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Before I get started, let me preface this by saying that I have no idea what the hell I'm talking about. But, in the spirit of being an arrogant physicist, I'm going to go ahead and make some back-of-the-envelope calculations, and expect that this post will be accurate to within a few orders of magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, how long will the Earth rotate around the Sun before drag from the heliosphere stops it? This seems like a problem for fluid dynamics. How do we calculate what the drag is on the Earth? Rather than solve the fluid dynamics equations, let's make some arguments based on dimensional analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can the drag of the Earth depend on? It certainly depends on the speed of the Earth v -- if an object isn't moving, there can't be any drag. We also expect that a wider object feels more drag, so the drag force should depend on the radius of the Earth R. Finally, the density of the heliosphere might have something to do with it. If we fudge around with these, we see that there is only 1 combination that gives units of force:
 &lt;mathjax&gt;$$
 F_{drag} \sim \rho v^2 R^2
 $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have the force, the energy dissipated from the Earth to the heliosphere after moving a distance &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; is &lt;i&gt;E_lost = F&lt;em&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;. If the Earth moves with speed v for time t, then we can write &lt;i&gt;E_lost = F&lt;/em&gt;v&lt;em&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;. So we can get an idea of the time scale over which the Earth starts to fall into the Sun by taking &lt;i&gt;E_lost = E_Earth ~ 1/2 M_Earth v^2&lt;/i&gt;. Rearranging and dropping factors of 1/2 gives
 &lt;mathjax&gt;$$
 T_\textrm{Earth burns} \sim M_{Earth} v^2 / (F_{drag}\times v) \\ \qquad  \sim M_{Earth} / (\rho R^2 v)
$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
Using the velocity of the Earth as &lt;i&gt;2&lt;/em&gt;pi *&lt;/i&gt; 1 Astronomical unit/year, Googlin' for some numbers, and taking the &lt;a href="http://web.mit.edu/space/www/helio.review/axford.suess.html"&gt;density of the heliosphere&lt;/a&gt; to be 10^-23 g/cc  we get... &lt;mathjax&gt;$$ T \approx 10^{19} \textrm{ years} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;  Looks like this won't be the cause of the Mayan apocalypse. (By comparison, the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun#Life_cycle"&gt;Sun will burn out &lt;/a&gt;after only ~10^9 years.) &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Brian</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 29 Nov 2012 22:58:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2012-11-29:posts/when-will-the-earth-fall-into-the-sun-.html</guid><category></category></item><item><title>Creating an Earth</title><link>http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/creating-an-earth.html</link><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GIQN6QGw6T8/UIxWmYKvaRI/AAAAAAAAABU/vltgjZeUJus/s1600/116.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GIQN6QGw6T8/UIxWmYKvaRI/AAAAAAAAABU/vltgjZeUJus/s200/116.png" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A while ago I decided I wanted to create something that looks like the surface of a planet, complete with continents &amp;amp; oceans and all. Since I've only been on a small handful of planets, I decided that I'd approximate this by creating something like the Earth on the computer (without cheating and just copying the real Earth).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where should I start? Well, let's see what the facts we know about the Earth tell us about how to create a new planet on the computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;Observation 1&lt;/b&gt;: Looking at a map of the Earth, we only see the heights of the surface. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's describe just the heights of the Earth's surface. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Observation 2 &lt;/b&gt;: The Earth is a sphere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So (wait for it) we need to describe the height on a spherical surface. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can recast our problem of making an Earth more precisely mathematically. We want to know the heights of the planet's surface at each point on the Earth. So we're looking for field (the height of the planet) defined on the surface of a sphere (the different spots on the planet). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like a function on the real line can be expanded in terms of its Fourier components, almost any function on the surface of a sphere can be expanded as a sum of spherical harmonics Y&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;lm&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. This means we can write the height &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt; of our planets surfaces as &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$
h(\theta, \phi) = \sum A_{lm}Y_l^m(\theta, \phi) \quad (1)
$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
If we figure out what the coefficients A of the sum should be, then we can start making some Earths! Let's see if we can use some other facts about the Earth's surface to get get a handle on what coefficients to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Observation 3&lt;/b&gt;: I don't know every detail of the Earth's surface, whose history is impossibly complicated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll capture this lack-of-knowledge by describing the surface of our imaginary planet as some sort of random variable. Equation (1) suggests that we can do this by making the coefficients &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt; random variables. At some point we need to make an executive decision on what type of random variable we'll use. For various reasons, &lt;a href='#footnote1'&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; I decided I'd use a Gaussian random variable with mean 0 and standard deviation &lt;i&gt;a&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;lm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;:
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$
A_{lm} = a_{lm} N(0,1)
$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
(Here I'm using the notation that &lt;i&gt;N(m,v)&lt;/i&gt; is a normal or Gaussian random variable with mean &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt; and variance &lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;. If you multiply a Gaussian random variable by a constant &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;, it's the same as multiplying the variance by &lt;i&gt;a^2&lt;/i&gt;, so &lt;i&gt;a*N(0,1)&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;N(0,a^2)&lt;/i&gt; are the same thing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Observation 4&lt;/b&gt;: The heights of the surface of the Earth are more-or-less independent of their position on the Earth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In keeping with this, I'll try to use coefficients &lt;i&gt;a&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;lm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt; that will give me a random field that is is isotropic on average. This seems hard at first, so let's just make a hand-waving argument. Looking at some &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_harmonics"&gt;pretty pictures&lt;/a&gt; of spherical harmonics, we can see that each spherical harmonic of degree l has about l stripes on it, independent of m. So let's try using alm's that depend only on l, and are constant if just m changes. &lt;a href='footnote2'&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;. Just for convenience, we'll pick this constant to be &lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt; to some power &lt;i&gt;-p&lt;/i&gt;:
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$
a_{lm} = l^{-p} \quad \textrm{ or}
$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$
h(\theta, \phi) = \sum_{l,m} N_{lm}(0,1) l^{-p} Y_l^m(\theta, \phi) \quad (2)
$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I got bored &amp;amp; decided to see what a planet would look like if we didn't know what value of p to use. So below is a movie of a randomly generated "planet" with a fixed choice of random numbers, but with the power&lt;i&gt; p&lt;/i&gt; changing. 
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;object width="320" height="266" class="BLOG_video_class" id="BLOG_video-35e95347156e2467" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="//www.youtube.com/get_player"&gt;&lt;param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF"&gt;&lt;param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;param name="flashvars" value="flvurl=http://redirector.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?id%3D35e95347156e2467%26itag%3D5%26source%3Dblogger%26app%3Dblogger%26cmo%3Dsensitive_content%253Dyes%26ip%3D0.0.0.0%26ipbits%3D0%26expire%3D1363446061%26sparams%3Did,itag,source,ip,ipbits,expire%26signature%3DAF98EECA6723029623AA4A4FD1B6F8916C6F45BE.B069BD3B47D585FF3F379B7FC023C17C3FB0C764%26key%3Dck2&amp;amp;iurl=http://video.google.com/ThumbnailServer2?app%3Dblogger%26contentid%3D35e95347156e2467%26offsetms%3D5000%26itag%3Dw160%26sigh%3D3tMKuCkA0PvX3Rh_465wdL2miwg&amp;amp;autoplay=0&amp;amp;ps=blogger"&gt;&lt;embed src="//www.youtube.com/get_player" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="320" height="266" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" flashvars="flvurl=http://redirector.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?id%3D35e95347156e2467%26itag%3D5%26source%3Dblogger%26app%3Dblogger%26cmo%3Dsensitive_content%253Dyes%26ip%3D0.0.0.0%26ipbits%3D0%26expire%3D1363446061%26sparams%3Did,itag,source,ip,ipbits,expire%26signature%3DAF98EECA6723029623AA4A4FD1B6F8916C6F45BE.B069BD3B47D585FF3F379B7FC023C17C3FB0C764%26key%3Dck2&amp;iurl=http://video.google.com/ThumbnailServer2?app%3Dblogger%26contentid%3D35e95347156e2467%26offsetms%3D5000%26itag%3Dw160%26sigh%3D3tMKuCkA0PvX3Rh_465wdL2miwg&amp;autoplay=0&amp;ps=blogger" allowFullScreen="true" /&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
As the movie starts (p=0), we see random uncorrelated heights on the surface &lt;a href='footnote3'&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;. As the movie continues and p increases, we see the surface smooth out rapidly. Eventually, after p=2 or so, the planet becomes very smooth and doesn't look at all like a planet. So the "correct" value for p is somewhere above 0 (too bumpy) and below 2 (too smooth). Can we use more observations about Earth to predict what a good value of p should be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Observation 5&lt;/b&gt;: The elevation of the Earth's surface exists everywhere on Earth (duh). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we're going to need our sum to exist. How the hell are we going to sum that series though! Not only is it random, but it also depends on where we are on the planet! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than try to evaluate that sum everywhere on the sphere, I decided that it would be easiest to evaluate the sum at the "North Pole" at &lt;i&gt;theta=0&lt;/i&gt;. Then, if we picked our coefficients right, this should be statistically the same as any other point on the planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do we want to look at &lt;i&gt;theta = 0&lt;/i&gt;? Well, if we look back at the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_harmonics"&gt;wikipedia entry&lt;/a&gt; for spherical harmonics, we see that 
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$
Y_l^m = \sqrt{ \frac{2 l + 1}{4\pi}\frac{(l-m)!}{(l+m)!}} e^{im\phi}P^m _ l(\cos\theta) \quad (3)
$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn't look too helpful -- we've just picked up another special function Plm that we need to worry about. But there is a trick with these special functions Plm: at theta = 0, Plm is 0 if m isn't 0, and Pl0 is 1. So at theta = 0 this is simply:
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$
Y_l^m(\theta = 0) = \bigg \{ ^{\sqrt{(2l+1)/4\pi},\, m=0}_{0,\,m \ne 0}
$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we just have, from every equation we've written down:
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$
h(\theta = 0) = \sum_l \times l^{-p} \times \sqrt{(2l+1)/4\pi }\times N(0,1) $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$
\quad \qquad =  \times \frac 1 {\sqrt{4\pi}} \times \sum_l N(0,l^{-2p}(2l+1)) $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$
\quad \qquad =  \times \frac 1 {\sqrt{4\pi}} \times N(0,\sum_l l^{-2p}(2l+1) ) $$&lt;/mathjax&gt; &lt;mathjax&gt;$$
\quad \qquad = \times \frac 1 {\sqrt{4\pi}} \sqrt{\sum_l l^{-2p}(2l+1)}
\times N(0,1) $$&lt;/mathjax&gt; &lt;mathjax&gt;$$
\quad \qquad \sim \sqrt{\sum_l l^{-2p+1}} N(0,1) \qquad (4)
$$&lt;/mathjax&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for the surface of our imaginary planet to exist, we had better have that sum converge, or &lt;i&gt;-2p+1 &amp;lt; -1 (p &amp;gt; 1)&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we've also learned something else!!! Our model always gives back a Gaussian height distribution on the surface. Changing the coefficients changes the variance of distribution of heights, but that's all it does to the distribution. Evidently if we want to get a non-Gaussian distribution of heights, we'd need to stretch our surface after evaluating the sum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, what does the height distribution look like from my simulated planets? Just for the hell of it, I went ahead and generated ~400 independent surfaces at ~40 different values for the exponent &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;, looking at the first 22,499 terms in the series. From these surfaces I reconstructed the measured distributions; I've combined them into a movie which you can see below. 
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;

As you can see from the movie, the distributions look like Gaussians. The fits from Eq. (4) are overlaid in black dotted lines. (Since I can't sum an infinite number of spherical harmonics with a computer, I've plotted the fit I'd expect from just the terms I've summed. ) As you can see, they are all close to Gaussians. Not bad. Let's see what else we can get. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Observation 6&lt;/b&gt;: According to some famous people, the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Long_Is_the_Coast_of_Britain%3F_Statistical_Self-Similarity_and_Fractional_Dimension"&gt;Earth's surface is probably a fractal whose coastlines are non-differentiable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that we want a value of p that will make our surface rough enough so that its gradient doesn't exist (the derivative of the sum of Eq. (2) doesn't converge). At this point I'm getting bored with writing out calculations, so I'm just going to make some scaling arguments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Eq. (3), we know that each of the spherical harmonics Ylm is related to a polynomial of degree l in cos(theta). So if we take a derivative, I'd expect us to pick up another factor of l each time. Following through all the steps of Eq. (4) we find
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$
\vec{\nabla}h \sim \sqrt{\sum_l l^{-2p+3}}\vec{N}(0,1) \quad ,
$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
which converges for p &amp;gt; 2. So for our planet to be "fractal," we want &lt;i&gt;1&amp;lt;p&amp;lt;2&lt;/i&gt;. Looking at the first movie, this seems reasonable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Observation 7&lt;/b&gt;: 70% of the Earth's surface is under water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Earth, we can think of the points underwater as all those points below a certain threshold height. So let's threshold the heights on our sphere. If we want 70% of our generated planet's surface to be under water, Eq (4) and the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function"&gt;cumulative distribution function &lt;/a&gt;of a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"&gt;Gaussian distribution&lt;/a&gt; tells us that we want to pick a critical height &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt; such that 
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$
\frac 1 2 \left[ 1 + \textrm{erf}(H/\sqrt{2\sigma^2}) \right] = 0.7 \quad \textrm{or}
$$&lt;/mathjax&gt; &lt;mathjax&gt;$$
H = \sqrt{2\sigma^2}\textrm{erf}^{-1}(0.4)
$$&lt;/mathjax&gt; &lt;mathjax&gt;$$
\sigma^2 = \frac 1 {4\pi} \sum_l l^{-2p}(2l+1) \quad (5)\, ,
$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
where &lt;i&gt;erf()&lt;/i&gt; is a special function called the error function, and erf-1 is its inverse. We can evaluate these numerically (or by using some &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_Function#Asymptotic_expansion"&gt;dirty tricks&lt;/a&gt; if we're feeling especially masochistic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for our generated planet, let's call all the points with a height larger than H "land," and all the points with a height less than H "ocean." Here is what it looks like for a planet with&lt;i&gt; p=0, p=1&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;p=2&lt;/i&gt;, plotted with the same &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinusoidal_projection"&gt;Sanson projection&lt;/a&gt; as before. 
&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bWQBhSTYGAc/UIxZyk1d9dI/AAAAAAAAABk/FSZtM2jZ24g/s1600/allContinents.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bWQBhSTYGAc/UIxZyk1d9dI/AAAAAAAAABk/FSZtM2jZ24g/s400/allContinents.png" width="258" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Top to bottom: p=0, p=1, and p=2. I've colored all the "water" (positions with heights &amp;lt; &lt;i&gt;H &lt;/i&gt;as given in Eq. (5) ) blue and all the land (heights &amp;gt; &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;) green. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see that the the total amount of land area is roughly constant among the three images, but we haven't fixed how it's distributed. Looking at the map above for &lt;i&gt;p=0&lt;/i&gt;, there are lots of small "islands" but no large contiguous land masses. For &lt;i&gt;p=2&lt;/i&gt;, we see only one contiguous land mass (plus one 5-pixel island), and &lt;i&gt;p=1&lt;/i&gt; sits somewhere in between the two extremes. None of these look like the Earth, where there are a few large landmasses but many small islands. From our previous arguments, we'd expect something between p=1 and p=2 to look like the Earth, which is in line with the above picture. But how do we decide which value of p to use? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Observation 8&lt;/b&gt;: The Earth has 7 continents &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is more vague than the others, but I think it's the coolest of all the arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we compare our generated planets to the Earth? The Earth has 7 continents that comprise 4 different contiguous landmasses. In order, these are 1) Europe-Asia-Africa, 2) North- and South- America, 3) Antartica, and 4) Australia, with a 5th Greenland barely missing out. In terms of fractions of the Earth's surface, Google tells us that Australia covers 0.15% of the Earth's total surface area, and Greenland covers 0.04%. So let's define a "continent" as any contiguous landmass that accounts for more than 0.1% of the planet's total area. Then we can ask: What value of &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; gives us a planet with 4 continents? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea how to calculate exactly what that number would be from our model, but I can certainly measure it from the simulated results. I went ahead and counted the number of continents in the generated planets. 
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eGMLLNCMVRU/UIxbi6MYw9I/AAAAAAAAAB8/BFVHUaEctBA/s1600/numContinents.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eGMLLNCMVRU/UIxbi6MYw9I/AAAAAAAAAB8/BFVHUaEctBA/s400/numContinents.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-W3qT-_LOlT4/UIxaxqd1b9I/AAAAAAAAABs/HZEMht7uzlU/s1600/numContinents.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The results are plotted above. The solid red line is the median values of the number of continents, as measured over 400 distinct worlds at 40 different values of p. The red shaded region around it is the band containing the upper and lower quartiles of the number of continents. For comparison, in black on the right y-axis I've also plotted the log of the total number of landmasses at the resolution I've used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of continents has a resonant value of p -- if p is too small, then there are many landmasses, but none are big enough to be continents. Conversely, if p is too large, then there is only one huge landmass. Somewhere in the middle, around p=0.5, there are about 20 continents, at least when only the first ~23000 terms in the series are summed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the curve, we see that there are roughly two places where there are 4 continents in the world -- at p=0.1 and at p=1.3. Since p=0.1 doesn't converge, and since p=0.1 will have way too many landmasses, it looks like a generated Earth will look the best if we use a value of &lt;i&gt;p=&lt;/i&gt;1.3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's it. For your viewing pleasure, here is a video of three of these planets below, complete with water, continents, and mountains. &lt;a href='footnote4'&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id='footnote1'&gt;[1] Since I wanted a random surface, I wanted to make the mean of each coefficient 0. Otherwise we'd get a deterministic part of our surface heights. I picked a distribution that's symmetric about 0 because on Earth the bottom of the oceans seem roughly similar in terms of changes in elevation. I wanted to pick a stable distribution &amp;amp; independent coefficients because it makes the sums that come up easier to evalutate. Finally, I picked a Gaussian, as opposed to another stable distribution like a Lorentzian, because the tallest points on Earth are finite, and I wanted the variance of the planet's height to be defined. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id='footnote2'&gt;[2] We could make this rigorous by showing that a rotated spherical harmonic is orthogonal to other spherical harmonics of a different degree &lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;, but you don't want to see me try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id='footnote3'&gt;[3]Actually p=0 should correspond to completely uncorrelated delta-function noise. (You can convince yourself by looking at the spherical harmonic expansion for a delta-function.) The reason that the bumps have a finite width is that I only summed the first 22,499 terms in the series (l=150 and below). So the size of the bumps gives a rough idea of my resolution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id='foonote4'&gt;[4] For those of you keeping score at home, it took me more than 6 days to figure out how to make these planets.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Brian</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 27 Oct 2012 19:07:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2012-10-27:posts/creating-an-earth.html</guid><category></category></item><item><title>A Homemade Viscometer I</title><link>http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/a-homemade-viscometer-i.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Stirring a bowl of honey is much more difficult than stirring a bowl of water. But why? The mass density of the honey is about the same as that of water, so we aren't moving more material. If we were to write out Newton's equation, &lt;i&gt;ma&lt;/i&gt; would be about the same, but yet we still need to put in much more force. Why? And can we measure it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
The reason that honey is harder to stir is of course that the drag on our spoon depends on more than just the density of the fluid. The drag also depends on the viscosity of the fluid -- loosely speaking, how thick it is -- and the viscosity of honey is about 400 times that of water, depending on the conditions. In fact, a quick perusal of the Wikipedia article on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity"&gt;viscosity&lt;/a&gt; shows that viscosities can vary by a fantastic amount -- some 13 orders of magnitude, from easy-to-move gases to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_drop_experiment"&gt;thick pitch that behaves like a solid except&lt;/a&gt; on long time scales. The situation is even more complicated than this, as some fluids can have a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Newtonian_fluid"&gt;viscosity that changes depending on the flow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to find a way to measure the viscosities of the stuff around me, so I made the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscometer"&gt;viscometer &lt;/a&gt; pictured below for about $1.75 (the vending machines in Clark Hall are pretty expensive). How? Well, I &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3R2mNiV_-KY/UA4pOLSKLSI/AAAAAAAAABA/X4MHVcrh93M/s1600/DSCF4438.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3R2mNiV_-KY/UA4pOLSKLSI/AAAAAAAAABA/X4MHVcrh93M/s400/DSCF4438.JPG" width="300" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;My homemade viscometer, taking data on the viscosity of water. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enjoyed the crisp, refreshing taste of Diet Pepsi from a 20 oz bottle (come on, sponsorships). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cut the top and bottom off the bottle, so all that was left was a straight tube. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mounted the bottle with on top of a small piece of flat plastic. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mounted a single-tubed coffee stirrer horizontally out of the bottle (I placed the end towards the middle of the bottle to avoid end effects). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Epoxied or glued the entire edge shut. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Marked evenly-spaced lines on the side of the bottle. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can load my "sample" fluid in the top of the Pepsi bottle, and time how long it takes for the sample level to drop to a certain point. A more viscous fluid will take more time to leave the bottle, with the time directly proportional to the viscosity. (This is a consequence of Stokes flow and the equation for flow in a pipe. It will always be true, as long as my fluid is viscous enough and my apparatus isn't too big.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we're done! All we need to do is calibrate our viscometer with one sample, measure the times, and then we can go out and measure stuff in the world! No need to stick around for the boring calculations! We can do some fun science over the next few blog posts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is a physics blog written by a bunch of grad students, so I'm assuming that a few of you want to see the details. (I won't judge you if you don't though.) If we think about the problem for a bit, we basically have flow of a liquid through a pipe (i.e. the coffee stirrer), plus a bunch of other crap which hopefully doesn't matter much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first need to think about how the fluid moves. We want to find the velocity of the fluid at every position. This is best cast in the language of vector calculus -- we have a (vector) velocity field &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; at a (vector) position &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. There are two things we know: 1) We don't (globally) gain or lose any fluid, and 2) Newton's laws &lt;i&gt;F=ma&lt;/i&gt; hold. We can write these equations as the Navier-Stokes equations: &lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \vec{\nabla}\cdot \vec{u} = 0 \quad (1) $$&lt;/mathjax&gt; &lt;mathjax&gt;$$  \ \rho \left( \frac {\partial \vec{u}} {\partial t} + (\vec{u}\cdot\vec{\nabla})\vec{u} \right) = - \vec{\nabla}p + \eta \nabla^2 \vec{u} \quad (2) $$&lt;/mathjax&gt; The first equation basically says that we don't have any fluid appearing or disappearing out of nowhere, and the second is basically &lt;i&gt;m&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;=&lt;b&gt;F&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, except written per unit volume. (The fluid's mass-per-unit-volume is &lt;i&gt;rho&lt;/i&gt;, the rate of change of our velocity is &lt;i&gt;d&lt;b&gt;u&lt;/b&gt;/dt&lt;/i&gt;, and our force per unit volume is &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;grad&lt;/b&gt;(p)&lt;/i&gt;, plus a viscous term &lt;i&gt;laplacian(&lt;b&gt;u&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;/i&gt;. The only complication is that &lt;i&gt;d&lt;b&gt;u&lt;/b&gt;/dt&lt;/i&gt; is a total derivative, which we need to write as &lt;i&gt;d&lt;b&gt;u&lt;/b&gt;/dt + d&lt;b&gt;u&lt;/b&gt;/d&lt;b&gt;x&lt;/b&gt;*d&lt;b&gt;x&lt;/b&gt;/dt&lt;/i&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't drag you through the &lt;a href="http://www.4shared.com/office/y9ay-fNh/Homemade_viscometer_-gory_sect.html?refurl=d1url"&gt;gory details&lt;/a&gt;, unless you want to see them, but it turns out that for my system the height of the fluid &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt; (measured from the coffee stirrer) versus time &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; is  &lt;mathjax&gt;$$ h(t) = h(0)e^{- t/T}, \quad T= 60.7 \textrm{sec} \times [\eta / \textrm{1 mPa*s}] \times [\textrm{ 1 g/cc} / \rho]  $$&lt;/mathjax&gt; [For my viscometer, the coffee stirrer has length 13.34 cm and inside diameter 2.4 mm, and the Pepsi bottle has a cross-sectional area of 36.3 square centimeters (3.4 cm inner radius). You can see how the timescale scales with these properties in the &lt;a href="http://www.4shared.com/office/y9ay-fNh/Homemade_viscometer_-gory_sect.html?refurl=d1url"&gt;gory details section&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RsGC2KaafVA/UA4pwpCbz6I/AAAAAAAAABI/S740sriRWg4/s1600/5.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RsGC2KaafVA/UA4pwpCbz6I/AAAAAAAAABI/S740sriRWg4/s400/5.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;A run with measured heights vs times &amp;amp; error bars. The majority of the uncertainty turns out to come from not knowing the exact proportions of the viscometer. I don't know exactly why the heights are systematically deviating from the fit, but I suspect it's that my gridlines aren't perfectly lined up with the bottom of my viscometer (it looks like ~5 mm off would do it, which I can totally believe looking at the picture of my viscometer). However, because of the linearity of the equations for steady flow in a pipe, we know that the time scales linearly with the viscosity, so we should be able to accurately measure relative viscosities. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, how well does it work? Above is a plot of the height of water in my viscometer versus time, with a best-fit value from the equations above. To get a sense of my random errors (such as how good I am at timing the flow), I measured this curve 5 separate times. If I take into account the uncertainties in my apparatus setup as systematic errors, I find a value for my viscosity as  &lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \eta \approx 1.429 \textrm{mPa* s} \pm 0.5 \% \textrm{Rand.} \pm 55\% \textrm{Syst.} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt; The actual value of the viscosity of water at room temperature (T=25 C) is about 0.86 mPa*s, which is more-or-less within my systematic errors. So it looks like I won't be able to measure absolute values of viscosity accurately without a more precise apparatus. But if I look at the variation of my measured viscosity, I see that I should probably be able to measure changes in viscosity to 0.5% !! That's pretty good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully over the next couple weeks I'll try to use my viscometer to measure some interesting physics in the viscosity of fluids.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Brian</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jul 2012 22:32:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2012-07-24:posts/a-homemade-viscometer-i.html</guid><category></category></item><item><title>How Cold is the Ground II</title><link>http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/how-cold-is-the-ground-ii.html</link><description>&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NE8upI-YG1I/T8F4TvyfkyI/AAAAAAAAAA0/YmQ_KLlOseA/s1600/mainImage.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NE8upI-YG1I/T8F4TvyfkyI/AAAAAAAAAA0/YmQ_KLlOseA/s200/mainImage.png" width="90" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Images &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ithaca_Hemlock_Gorge.JPG"&gt;from &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mercury_in_color_-_Prockter07_centered.jpg"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week (ok, it was a little more than a few days ago....) I used dimensional analysis to figure out how the ground's temperature changes with time. But although dimensional analysis can give us information about the length scales in the problem, it doesn't tell us what the solution looks like. From dimensional analysis, we don't even know what the solution does at large times and distances. (Although we can usually see the asymptotic behavior directly from the equation.) So let's go ahead and solve the the heat equation exactly:
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$
\frac {\partial T}{\partial t} = a \frac {\partial ^2 T}{\partial x^2} \quad (1)
$$&lt;/mathjax&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, what type of solution do we want to this equation? We want the temperature at the Earth's surface &lt;i&gt;x=0&lt;/i&gt; to change with the days or the seasons. So let's start out modeling this with a sinusoidal dependence -- we'll look for a solution of the form
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$
 T(x,t) = A(x)e^{i wt}
$$&lt;/mathjax&gt; 
for some function &lt;i&gt;A(x)&lt;/i&gt;, then we can take the real part for our solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plugging this into Eq. (1) gives &lt;i&gt;A'' = iw/a * A&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$
A(x) = e^{ \pm \sqrt{w/2a } (1+i) x}
$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
Since we have a second-order ordinary differential equation for &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;, we have two possible solutions, which are like &lt;i&gt;exp(+x) &lt;/i&gt;or &lt;i&gt;exp(-x)&lt;/i&gt;. Which one do we choose? Well, we want the temperature very far away from the surface of the ground to be constant, so we need the solution that decays with distance, &lt;i&gt;A~exp(-x)&lt;/i&gt;. Taking the real part of this solution, we find &lt;a href="#footnote-1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$T(x,t) = T_0 \cos (wt + \sqrt{w/2a}\times x ) e^{-\sqrt{w/2a}x} \quad (2)
$$&lt;/mathjax&gt; 
Well, what does this solution &lt;i&gt;say&lt;/i&gt;?  As we expected from our scaling arguments last week, the distance scale depends on the &lt;i&gt;square root&lt;/i&gt; of the time scale -- if we decrease our frequency by 4 (say, looking at  changes over a season vs over a month), the ground gets cooler only 2x  deeper. We also see that the temperature oscillation drops off quite  rapidly as we go deeper into the ground, and that there is a "lag" the  farther you go into the ground. In particular, we see that at distances deep into the ground, the temperature drops to its average value at the surface. You can see this all in the pretty plot below (generated with Python):
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sqMX0J6IxWE/T8FWTQUcMQI/AAAAAAAAAAM/_esX_l0VLjs/s1600/SingleFrequency.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="301" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sqMX0J6IxWE/T8FWTQUcMQI/AAAAAAAAAAM/_esX_l0VLjs/s400/SingleFrequency.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Let's recap. To model the temperature of the ground, we looked for a solution to the heat equation which had a sinusoidally oscillating temperature at &lt;i&gt;x=0&lt;/i&gt;, and decayed to 0 at large &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;. We found a solution such a solution, and it shows that the temperature decays rapidly as we go far into the ground. At this point, there are two questions that pop into mind: 1) Is the solution that we found &lt;i&gt;unique&lt;/i&gt;? Or are there other possible solutions? 2) This is all well and good, but what if our days or seasons &lt;i&gt;aren't perfect sines&lt;/i&gt;? Can we find a solution that describes this behavior?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll give one (1) VirtuosiPoint to the first commenter who can prove to what extent the above solution is unique &lt;a href="#footnote-2"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;. But how about the second point? Can we solve this for non-sinusoidal time variations? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, at this point most of the readers are rolling their eyes and shouting "Use a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series"&gt;Fourier series&lt;/a&gt; and move on." So I will. Briefly, it turns out that (more or less) &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; periodic function can be written as a sum of sines &amp;amp; cosines. So we can just add a bunch of sines and cosines together and construct our final solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So just for fun, here is a plot of the temperature of the ground in Ithaca (data from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ithaca,_New_York"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;) over a year. (I used a discrete Fourier transform to compute the coefficients.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sYVDb4CwX9I/T8F4KNeQuqI/AAAAAAAAAAs/K12tb4CCrpc/s1600/IthacaTemp.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="301" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sYVDb4CwX9I/T8F4KNeQuqI/AAAAAAAAAAs/K12tb4CCrpc/s400/IthacaTemp.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;The temperature (colorbar) is in degrees C, assuming &lt;a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2012/05/how-cold-is-ground.html"&gt;&lt;i&gt;a=0.5 mm^2/s&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hNPxXpFwZag/T8F30BJbujI/AAAAAAAAAAk/v6Y4pzilvao/s1600/IthacaTemp.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks pretty boring, but I swear that all the frequencies are in that plot. It just turns out that the seasons in Ithaca are pretty sinusoidal. So about 20 meters below Ithaca, the temperature is a pretty constant 8 C.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was postponing writing this, I wondered what the temperature on Mercury's rocks would be. If we dig deep enough, can we find an area with habitable temperatures? Some &lt;a href="http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2000/OlesyaNisanov.shtml"&gt;quick &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_%28planet%29#Surface_conditions_and_.22atmosphere.22_.28exosphere.29"&gt;Googlin&lt;/a&gt;' shows that the daytime and nighttime temperatures on Mercury are ~550-700 K and ~110 K at the "equator." While I don't think that Mercury's temperature varies symmetrically, let's assume so for lack of better data.&lt;a href="#footnote-3"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; Then we'd expect that deep into the surface, the temperature would be fairly constant in time, at the average of these two extremes. Plugging in the numbers (assuming &lt;i&gt;a~0.52 mm^2/s &lt;/i&gt; and using a Mercurial solar day as 176 days), we get&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;T=94 &lt;/i&gt;C, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt; 2.75 meters into the surface. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="footnote-1"&gt;[1] More precisely, since the heat equation is linear and real, if &lt;i&gt;T(x,t) &lt;/i&gt;is a solution to the equation, then so are &lt;i&gt;1/2(T+T*)&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;1/2i(T-T*). &lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="footnote-2"&gt;[2] Hint: It's not unique. For instance, here is another  solution that satisfies the constraints, with no internal heat sources  or sinks (I'll call it the "freshly buried" solution):
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KiwBKp4WarU/T8FdnaHDloI/AAAAAAAAAAY/naHre8kRVIQ/s1600/buriedAlive.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="241" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KiwBKp4WarU/T8FdnaHDloI/AAAAAAAAAAY/naHre8kRVIQ/s320/buriedAlive.png" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Can  you prove that all the other solutions decay to the original solution?  Or is there a second or even a spectrum of steady state solutions? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p id="footnote-3"&gt;[3] If someone provides me with better data of the time variation of Mercury's surface at some specific latitude, I'll update with a full plot of the temperature as a function of depth and time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Brian</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 26 May 2012 21:28:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2012-05-26:posts/how-cold-is-the-ground-ii.html</guid><category></category></item><item><title>How Cold is the Ground?</title><link>http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/how-cold-is-the-ground-.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;It snowed in Ithaca a few weeks ago. Which sucked. But fortunately, it had been warm for the previous few days, and the ground was still warm so the snow melted fast. Aside from letting me enjoy the absurd arguments against global warming that snow in April birthed, this got me thinking: How cold is the ground throughout the year? At night vs. during the day? And the corollary: How cold is my basement? If I dig a deeper basement, can I save on heating and cooling? (I'm very cheap.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 Well, we want to know the temperature distribution &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; of the ground as a function of time &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; and position &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;. So some googlin' or previous knowledge shows that we need to solve the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation"&gt;heat equation&lt;/a&gt;. For our purposes, we can treat the Earth as flat (I don't plan on digging a basement deep enough to see the curvature of the Earth), so we can assume the temperature only changes with the depth into the ground &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;:
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$
 \frac {\partial T}{\partial t} = a \frac {\partial^2 T} {\partial x^2} \qquad (1)
$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
where &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; is the thermal diffusivity of the material, in units of square meters per second. It looks like we're going to have to solve some partial differential equations!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or will we? We can get a very good estimate of how much the temperature changes with depth just by dimensional analysis. Let's measure our time &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; in terms of a characteristic time of our problem &lt;i&gt;w&lt;/i&gt; (it could be 1 year if we were trying to see the change in the ground's temperature from summer to winter, or 1 day if we were looking at the change from day to night). Then we can write:
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$
\frac {\partial T } {\partial t} = \frac 1 w \frac {\partial T} {\partial t/w}
$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
 ... plugging this in Eq. (1), rearranging, and calling &lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;= sqrt(&lt;i&gt;w*a&lt;/i&gt;) gives....
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$
 \frac {\partial T}{\partial (t/w)} = \frac {\partial ^2 T} {\partial (x/ l )^2}
$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
Now let's say we didn't know how to or didn't want to solve this equation. (Don't worry, we do &amp;amp; we will). From rearranging this equation, we see right away there is only one "length scale" in the problem, &lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;. So if we had to guess, we could guess that the ground changes temperature a distance &lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt; into the ground. A quick look at Wikipedia for &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_diffusivity"&gt;thermal diffusivities&lt;/a&gt; gives us the following table, for materials we'd find in the ground:
 &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;.nobrtable br { display: none }&lt;/style&gt;&lt;div class="nobrtable"&gt;&lt;table border="2" bordercolor="black" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3" style="background-color: white;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr style="background-color: gray; color: black; padding-bottom: 4px; padding-top: 5px;"&gt;  &lt;th&gt; Material &lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;, mm^2/s&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt; (cm), &lt;i&gt;w&lt;/i&gt; = 1 day&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt; (cm), &lt;i&gt;w&lt;/i&gt; = 1 year&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Polycrystalline Silica (glass, sand)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.83&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;27 cm &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5.1 meters&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Crystalline Silica (quartz)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1.4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;35 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;6.6&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sandstone&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1.15&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;32&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;6.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Brick&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.52&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;21&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://soilphysics.okstate.edu/software/SoilTemperature/document.pdf"&gt;Soil &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.3-1.25&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;16-33&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;3.1-6.3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt; So we would expect that the temperature of the ground doesn't change much on a daily basis a foot or so below the ground, and doesn't change ever about 15-20 feet into the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to pat ourselves on the back for our skills at dimensional analysis, a quick check shows that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permafrost#Time_to_form_deep_permafrost"&gt;permafrost&lt;/a&gt; penetrates 14.6 feet into the ground after 1 year. So our dimensional estimates looks pretty good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next few days I'll solve this equation exactly and throw up a few pretty graphs, and maybe talk a little about PDE's and Fourier series in the process.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Brian</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 18 May 2012 00:20:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2012-05-18:posts/how-cold-is-the-ground-.html</guid><category></category></item><item><title>End of the Earth VII: The Big Freeze</title><link>http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/end-of-the-earth-vii-the-big-freeze.html</link><description>&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c8vJR4CVwZc/T5R7_62SLuI/AAAAAAAAAHU/POCT5Fhx-CQ/s1600/Space_Scene_Frozen_Earth_WP_BG_by_PimArt.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c8vJR4CVwZc/T5R7_62SLuI/AAAAAAAAAHU/POCT5Fhx-CQ/s320/Space_Scene_Frozen_Earth_WP_BG_by_PimArt.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: white; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: -webkit-auto;"&gt;http://tinyurl.com/7rdj996&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is traditional here at The Virtuosi to &lt;a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/04/end-of-earth-physics-i.html"&gt;plot&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/04/end-of-earth-ii-blaze-of-glory.html"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/04/end-of-earth-physics-iii-asteroids.html"&gt;destruction&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2011/04/end-of-earth-iv-shocking-destruction.html"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2011/04/end-of-earth-v-there-goes-sun.html"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2011/04/end-of-earth-vi-nanobot-destruction.html"&gt;earth&lt;/a&gt;.  We also are making secret plans for our volcano lair and death ray.  However, since it is earth day, we will only share with you the plans for the total doom of the earth, not the cybernetically enhanced guard dogs we're building for our &lt;a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2012/04/earth-day-2012-escape-to-moon.html"&gt;moon base&lt;/a&gt;.  The plan I reveal today is elegant in its simplicity.  I intend to alter the orbit of the earth enough to cause the earth to freeze, thus ending life as we know it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;According to the internet at large, the average surface temperature of the earth is ~15 C.  This average surface temperature is directly related to the power output of the sun.  More precisely, it is directly related to the radiated power from the sun that the earth absorbs.  Assuming that the earth's temperature is not changing (true enough for our purposes), the then power radiated by the earth must be equal to the power absorbed from the sun.  More precisely&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ P_{rad,earth}=P_{abs,sun}$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the radiated power goes as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$P_{rad}=\epsilon \sigma A_{earth} T^4 $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where A_earth is the surface area of the earth, T is the temperature of the earth, and epsilon and sigma are constants.  I'll be conservative and say that I want to cool the temperature of the earth down to 0 C.  The ratio of the power the earth will emit is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$\frac{P_{new}}{P_{old}}=\frac{T_{new}^4}{T_{old}^4} \approx .81$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the temperature ratio must be done in Kelvin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power radiated by the sun (or any star) drops off as the inverse square of the distance from the sun to the point of interest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$P_{sun} \sim \frac{1}{r^2} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reduce the power the earth receives from the sun to 81% of the current value would require&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$\frac{P_{sun,new}}{P_{sun,old}}=\frac{r_{old}^2}{r_{new}^2}=.81 $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tells us that the new earth-sun distance must be larger than the old (a good sanity check).  In fact, it gives&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$r_{new}=1.11 r_{old} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'll need to move the earth by 11% of the current distance from the earth to the sun.  No small task!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earth is in a circular orbit (or close enough).  To change to a circular orbit of larger radius requires two applications of thrust at opposite points  in the orbit  It turns out that the required boost in speed (the ratio of the speeds just before and after applying thrust) for the first boost of an object changing orbits is given by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$\frac{v_{f}}{v_{i}}=\sqrt{\frac{2R_{f}}{R_i+R_f}}=1.026$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To move from the transfer orbit to the final circular orbit requires&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$\frac{v_{f}}{v_{i}}=\sqrt{\frac{R_{i}+R_f}{2R_i}}=1.027$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that despite the fact that we boost the velocity at both points, the velocity of the final orbit is less than that of the initial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, how could we apply that much thrust?  Well, the change in momentum for the earth from each stage is roughly (ignoring the slight velocity increase of the transfer orbit)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$\Delta p = .03M_E v_E $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mass of the earth is ~6*10^24 kg, the orbital velocity is ~30 km/s, so&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$\Delta p = 5\cdot 10^{27} kg*m/s$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A solid rocket booster (the booster rocket used for shuttle launches, when those still happened) can apply about 12 MN of force for 75 s (thank you wikipedia).  That's a net momentum change of ~900 &lt;em&gt;10^9 kg&lt;/em&gt;m/s (900 billion!).  So we would only need&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$\frac{2*5\cdot 10^{27}}{9\cdot 10^{11}}=12 \cdot 10^{15}$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right, only 12 million billion booster rockets!  With those I can freeze the earth.  I assure you that this plan is proceeding on schedule, and will be ready shortly after we have constructed our volcano lair.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jesse</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 22 Apr 2012 19:34:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2012-04-22:posts/end-of-the-earth-vii-the-big-freeze.html</guid><category></category></item><item><title>Earth Day 2012: Escape to the Moon</title><link>http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/earth-day-2012-escape-to-the-moon.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;It is now Earth Day 2012, and, according to the Mayan predictions, &lt;a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/search/label/end%20of%20the%20earth"&gt;The Virtuosi will destroy the earth&lt;/a&gt;. In a futile attempt to fight my own mortality, I decided to send something to the Moon. It seems, for a poor graduate student trying to get to the Moon, the most difficult part is the Earth holding me back. So first I'll focus on escaping the Earth's gravitational potential well, and if that's possible, then I'll worry about more technical problems, such as actually hitting the moon. Moreover, in honor of the destructive spirit of The Virtuosi near Earth Day, I'll try to do this in the most Wiley-Coyote-esque way possible. &lt;span class="fullpost"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="fullpost"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;Preliminaries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want to get to the Moon, we need to first figure out how much energy we'll need to escape the Earth's gravitational pull. "That's easy!" you say. "We need to escape a gravitational well, and we know from Newton's law that the potential from a spherical mass  &lt;i&gt;M&lt;span style="font-size: xx-small;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt; 's gravity for a test mass &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt; is : 
\begin{equation}
\Phi = - \frac {G M_{E} m}{r}
\label{eqn:gravpot}
\end{equation}
We're currently sitting at the radius of the Earth &lt;i&gt;R&lt;span style="font-size: xx-small;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, so we simply need to plug this value in and we'll find out how much energy we need." This is all well and good, but i) I can never remember what the gravitational constant &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt; is, and ii) I have no idea what the mass of the Earth &lt;i&gt;M&lt;span style="font-size: xx-small;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is. So let's see if we can recast this in a form that's easier to do mental arithmetic in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, we know that the force of gravity is the related to the potential by:
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$
\vec{F}(r) = - \vec{\nabla} \Phi = - \frac {d\Phi}{dr} \hat{r} \\
\vec{F} = - \frac {G m M_E } {r^2}
\label{eqn:gravforce}
$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
Moreover, we all know that the force of gravity at the Earth's surface is &lt;i&gt;F(r=R&lt;span style="font-size: xx-small;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;)=-mg&lt;/i&gt;. Substituting this in gives:
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$
\frac {G m M_E} {R_E^2} = m g \quad \textrm{, or} 
$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
\begin{equation}
\frac {G m M_E}{R_E} =  m g {R_E}  \quad .
\label{eqn:betterDef}
\end{equation}
So the depth of the Earth's potential well at the Earth's surface is &lt;i&gt;mgR&lt;span style="font-size: xx-small;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. If we use &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; = 9.8 m/s^2 ~ 10 m/s^2 and &lt;i&gt;R&lt;span style="font-size: xx-small;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt; = 6378  km ~ 6x10^6  m, then we can write this as
\begin{equation}
\Delta \Phi = m g {R_E} \approx m \times 6 \times 10^7 \textrm{m}^2/\textrm{s}^2 \quad  \textrm{(1)},&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\end{equation}
give or take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How fast do we need to go if we're going to make it to the Moon? Well, at the minimum, we need the kinetic energy of our object to be equal to the depth of the potential well &lt;a href="#footnote-1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;, or 
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$
\frac 1 2 m v^2 = 6 m \times 10^7 \textrm{m}^2/\textrm{s}^2 \quad \textrm{or} \\
v \approx 1.1 \times 10^4 \textrm{ m/s   (2)} . 
$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
So we need to go pretty fast -- this is about Mach 33 (33 times the speed of sound in air). At this speed, we'd get from NYC to LA in under 7 minutes. Looks difficult, but let's see just how difficult it is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;Attempt I: Shoot to the Moon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What goes fast? Bullets go fast. Can we shoot our payload to the moon? Let's make some quick estimates. First, can we shoot a regular bullet to the moon? Well, we said that we need to go about Mach 33, and a fast bullet only goes about Mach 2, so we won't even get close. Since energy is proportional to  velocity squared, we'll only have (2/33)^2 ~ 0.4 % of the necessary kinetic energy. &lt;a href="#footnote-2"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's make a bigger bullet. How big does it need to be? Well, loosely speaking, we have the chemical potential energy of the powder being converted into kinetic energy of the bullet. Let's assume that the kinetic energy transfer ratio of the powder is constant. If a bullet receives kinetic energy &lt;i&gt;1/2m&lt;span style="font-size: xx-small;"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;v&lt;span style="font-size: xx-small;"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;^2&lt;/i&gt; from a mass &lt;i&gt;m&lt;span style="font-size: xx-small;"&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt; of powder, then for our payload to have kinetic energy &lt;i&gt;1/2 M V^2&lt;/i&gt;, we need a mass of powder &lt;i&gt;M&lt;span style="font-size: xx-small;"&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt; such that 
\begin{equation}
\frac {M_P} {m_P} = \frac M {m_b} \times \frac {V^2}{v_b^2}
\end{equation}
A quick reference to Wikipedia for a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.62%C3%9751mm_NATO"&gt;7.62x51mm NATO bullet&lt;/a&gt; shows that ~25 grams of powder propels a ~10 gram bullet at a speed of ~Mach 2.5. We need to get our payload moving at Mach 33, so (&lt;i&gt;V/v&lt;span style="font-size: xx-small;"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;)^2 ~ 175. If we send a 10 kg payload to the Moon, we have &lt;i&gt;M/m&lt;span style="font-size: xx-small;"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt; ~ 1000. So we'll need about 1.75 x 10^5 the amount of powder of a bullet to get us to the Moon, or about 4400 kg, which is 4.8 tons (English) of powder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a lot of gunpowder to get us to the Moon. For comparison, if we are going to construct a tube-like "case" for our 10 kg bullet-to-the-Moon, it will have to be about half a meter in diameter and 17 feet tall. So I'm not going to be able to shoot anything to the Moon anytime soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;Attempt II: Charge to the Moon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, shooting something to the Moon is out. Can we use an electric field to propel something to the Moon? Well, we would need to pass a charged object through a potential difference such that
\begin{equation}
q \Delta \Phi_E = m g R_E = 6 m \times 10^7 \textrm{m}^2/\textrm{s}^2 \quad . 
\label{eqn:chargepot}
\end{equation}
After the humiliation of the last section, let's start out small. Can we send an electron to the Moon? We could plug numbers into this equation, but I'm too lazy to look up all those values. Instead, we know that we need to get our electron (rest mass 511 keV) to a speed which is (Eq. 2) 
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$v \approx 1.1 \times 10^4 \textrm{m/s} \approx 4 \times 10^{-5} c.
$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
So an electron moving at this velocity will have a kinetic energy of 
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \textrm{KE}  = m c^2 \times \frac 1 2 \frac {v^2}{c^2} = 511 \textrm{ keV} \times \frac 1 2 \frac {v^2}{c^2} \\
 \qquad  \approx 511 \textrm{ keV} \times  0.8 \times 10^{-9} \approx 0.4 \times 10^{-3} eV.
$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
So we can give an electron enough kinetic energy to get to the moon with a voltage difference of 0.4 mV, assuming it doesn't hit anything on the way up (it will). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can send an electron to the Moon! How about a proton? Well, the mass of a proton is 1836x that of an electron, but with the same charge, so we'd need 1836 * 0.4 mV ~ 0.73 V to get a proton to the Moon -- again, pretty easy. Continuing this logic, we can send a singly-charged ion with mass 12 amu (&lt;i&gt;i.e.&lt;/i&gt; C-) with a 9V battery, and a singly-charged ion with mass 150 amu (something like caprylic acid) using a 110V voltage drop. (Again, assuming these don't hit anything on the way up.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about our 10 kg object? Let's say we can miraculously charge it with 0.01 C of charge. &lt;a href="#footnote-3"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; Then from Eq. (1), we'd need
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ 0.01 C \times \Delta \Phi_E \approx 6 \times 10^8 \textrm{ J ,}
$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
or a potential difference of
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$
\Delta \Phi_E = 6 \times 10^{10} \textrm{ V. }
$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
That is a HUGE potential drop. For comparison, if we have 2 parallel plates with a surface charge of 0.01 C/m^2 (again, a huge charge density), they'd have to be a distance 
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$
d = 6 \times 10^{10} \textrm{V} \times \epsilon_0 / (0.01 \textrm{C/m}^2) \approx 53 \textrm{ meters apart} 
$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like I won't be able to send something to the Moon using tools from my basement anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;div id="footnote-1"&gt;&lt;span class="fullpost"&gt;[1] We'll ignore both air resistance and the Moon's gravitational attraction for simplicity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="fullpost"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;div id="footnote-2"&gt;&lt;span class="fullpost"&gt;[2] Since the potential &lt;i&gt;U ~ - 1/r&lt;/i&gt;, if we increase our potential energy by 0.4%, this is (to 1st order) the same as increasing &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; by 0.4%. So we'll get 0.004 * 6378 km ~ 25 km above the Earth's surface. Of course &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/dotphysics/2009/09/how-high-does-a-bullet-go.php"&gt;air resistance slows it down a lot&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="fullpost"&gt;&lt;div id="footnote-3"&gt;[3] According to Wikipedia, this is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_%28charge%29"&gt;0.04% of the total charge of a thundercloud&lt;/a&gt;. And if our object is uniformly charged with a radius of 1 m, it will have an electrical self-energy of &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$
U = \frac 1 2 \int \epsilon_0 E^2 dV \approx 36 \textrm{kJ}
$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Brian</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 22 Apr 2012 15:12:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2012-04-22:posts/earth-day-2012-escape-to-the-moon.html</guid><category></category></item><item><title>Calculator Pi</title><link>http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/calculator-pi.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;There is a very fast converging algorithm for computing pi that you can do on a desktop calculator.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border="0"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;# steps &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Digits right &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;11 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;3 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;33 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;4 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;100 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;5 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;301 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;6 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;903  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;7 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2708 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;8 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;8124&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of course on a pocket calculator, you only need to do 2 steps to have an accuracy greater than the calculator can display.  To make this chart I had to trick a computer into doing high precision arithmetic, the code is &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/2038329"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted, this approximation is really cheating, since sin is a hard function to compute, and basically being able to compute sin means you know what pi is already.  Really, this is just &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_method"&gt;Newton's method&lt;/a&gt; for computing the root of sin(x) in disguise&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Alemi</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 14 Mar 2012 14:16:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2012-03-14:posts/calculator-pi.html</guid><category></category></item><item><title>The Stars Fell on Abe and Frederick</title><link>http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/the-stars-fell-on-abe-and-frederick.html</link><description>&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-p3-DTUn3sJ0/TwJnlct7XLI/AAAAAAAAASQ/1nZ0xtbwXHo/s1600/leonids_pic.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-p3-DTUn3sJ0/TwJnlct7XLI/AAAAAAAAASQ/1nZ0xtbwXHo/s320/leonids_pic.jpg" width="209" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;The 1833 Leonids (Source: Wikipedia)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Word on the street is there's a meteor shower set for late Tuesday night, peaking at 2 am EST on January 4th &lt;a href="#footnote-1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="" id="back-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  The meteors in question are the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrantids"&gt;Quadrantids&lt;/a&gt;, which often go unnoticed for two good reasons.  Reason the first:  apparently &lt;a href="#footnote-2"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="" id="back-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, they are usually pretty awful.  Unlike the "good" meteor showers, the Quadrantids are bright and pretty for only a few hours (instead of a few days). This means that a lot of the time, we just miss them.  Reason the second: they have a lame name &lt;a href="#footnote-3"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="" id="back-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But this year, they should be pretty good if the weather is right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there's lots of neat physics to talk about with meteors, but that's not why I bring it up. This has all just been flimsy pretext so I could share a historical anecdote about a meteor shower. Trickery, indeed.  Those who feel cheated are free to leave now with &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apu_585SW18"&gt;heads held high&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those still around (Hi, Mom!) will hear about the night in 1833 when the stars fell on &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ibV3tCDvd8"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt; (and the rest of the country, too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonids"&gt;Leonids&lt;/a&gt; typically put on a pretty good show, but their showing in 1833 was so dramatic that the term "meteor shower" was coined to describe what was happening. The 1833 Leonids were truly one for the ages and made such an impression that people were often able to remember when events happened by their relation to the night when "the stars fell." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was in this use as a "calendar anchor" that I first heard of this particular meteor shower. While home &lt;span style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;for the holiday I was reading &lt;i&gt;Life and Times of Frederick Douglass&lt;/i&gt;, one of the later autobiographies written by the former slave and noted abolitionist. Recounting when he was moved from Baltimore to a plantation on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, Douglass writes:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: white; text-align: left;"&gt; I went to St. Michaels to live in March, 1833. I know the year, because it was the one succeeding the first cholera in Baltimore, and was also the year of that strange phenomenon when the heavens seemed about to part with their starry train. I witnessed this gorgeous spectacle, and was awe-struck. The air seemed filled with bright descending messengers from the sky. It was about daybreak when I saw this sublime scene. I was not without the suggestion, at the moment, that it might be the harbinger of the coming of the Son of Man; and in my then state of mind I was prepared to hail Him as my friend and deliverer. I had read that the "stars shall fall from heaven," and they were now falling. I was suffering very much in my mind. It did seem that every time the young tendrils of my affection became attached they were rudely broken by some unnatural outside power; and I was looking away to heaven for the rest denied me on earth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;Douglass wrote these words almost 50 years after the fact and it is evident that the meteor shower clearly had an effect on him. By this time (at age 15), Douglass had already made up his mind to escape from slavery. Three years later, he made a failed attempt. Two years after that, in 1838, Frederick Douglass escaped to the North and became an influential abolitionist.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;After reading the above passage from Douglass, I wondered who else may have seen the 1833 Leonids. After a bit of research, I found a paper by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://ecommons.txstate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&amp;amp;context=physfacp&amp;amp;sei-redir=1&amp;amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fsa%3Dt%26rct%3Dj%26q%3Dolson%2Blincoln%2Bleonids%26source%3Dweb%26cd%3D1%26ved%3D0CB4QFjAA%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fecommons.txstate.edu%252Fcgi%252Fviewcontent.cgi%253Farticle%253D1004%2526context%253Dphysfacp%26ei%3DaogCT_2TB4rv0gGZ_5HoBw%26usg%3DAFQjCNE8HE4-k_Zcl2PzK2shdtMCi6ZyEQ#search=%22olson%20lincoln%20leonids%22" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;Olson &amp;amp; Jasinski (1999)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt; which provides an excerpt from Walt Whitman recounting a story told by Abraham Lincoln.  Whitman writes:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;In the gloomiest period of the war, he [Lincoln] had a call from a large delegation of bank presidents. In the talk after business was settled, one of the big Dons asked Mr. Lincoln if his conﬁdence in the permanency of the Union was not beginning to be shaken — whereupon the homely President told a little story. “When I was a young man in Illinois,” said he, “I boarded for a time with a Deacon of the Presbyterian church. One night I was roused from my sleep by a rap at the door, &amp;amp; I heard the Deacon’s voice exclaiming ‘Arise, Abraham, the day of judgment has come!’ I sprang from my bed &amp;amp; rushed to the window, and saw the stars falling in great showers! But looking back of them in the heavens I saw all the grand old constellations with which I was so well acquainted, ﬁxed and true in their places. Gentlemen, the world did not come to an end then, nor will the Union now."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;Abraham Lincoln witnessed the 1833 meteor shower and was still telling stories about it 30 years later.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;So what's the point of this whole story? Is there any significance to the fact that the man who escaped slavery to tell the world of its evils and "The Great Emancipator" both saw the same meteor shower?  Probably not.  Tons of people saw it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;Regardless, it is interesting to think about. Though these men would cross paths several times over the next 30 years, the earliest memory they shared was of a night in 1833, when a 15 year old slave in Maryland and a 24 year old boarder in Illinois watched the stars fall from the sky. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="footnote-1"&gt;[1] I use "Tuesday night" here to mean, of course, "Wednesday morning." &lt;a href="#back-1"&gt;[back]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="footnote-3"&gt;[3] Like other meteor showers, the Quadrantids take their name from the constellation from which the meteors seem to emerge.  In this case, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrans_Muralis"&gt;Quadrans Mural&lt;/a&gt;: The Mural Quadrant. Unfortunately for Quadrans Mural, the constellations dumped it like the planets dumped Pluto. &lt;a href="#back-3"&gt;[back]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Corky</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2012 20:02:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2012-01-02:posts/the-stars-fell-on-abe-and-frederick.html</guid><category></category></item><item><title>Earth Day Special: Post-Apocalyptic Literature</title><link>http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/earth-day-special-post-apocalyptic-literature.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/23/Emergence_cover_first_edition.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 309px; height: 507px;" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/23/Emergence_cover_first_edition.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
At some point in elementary school I got into the habit of reading Franz Kafka's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Metamorphosis"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;The Metamorphosis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; every time that I got sick.  I found it strangely comforting to be reminded that while I might have &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlet_fever"&gt;scarlet fever&lt;/a&gt; and be intermittently hallucinating about Mickey Mouse, at least I had not been (spoiler alert!) turned into a giant cockroach and disowned by my family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en#q=Earth+Day&amp;amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;amp;fp=38378e84586d88e6"&gt;Earth Day&lt;/a&gt;!  The earth has seen better days, and I got too depressed googling various environmental problems to even come up with a suitable list of examples.  However, look on the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlBiLNN1NhQ"&gt;bright side&lt;/a&gt;: things could be much, much worse.  To explore how much worse it could be, here's a few of my favorite works of post-apocalyptic fiction - perfect reading for Earth Day.  Skip past the cut to check them out.

And by that, I mean explore the creation of cameras from their components and then create a very primitive one from readily available materials. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;In terms of history and simplicity, we should start with the pinhole camera.  I've heard stories that Newton used a pinhole camera to look at the sun though I don't know if this was before or after he stared directly at it for 8 minutes.  The pinhole is neat because it is so simple.  With a pinhole, light is focused simply by restricting the paths which an incident ray may take to hit our film.  Typically, diffuse and specular scattering sends light bouncing every which way off an object.  The pinhole just restricts which directions hit the film.  I think a picture is a better guide to this concept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;margin-bottom: 0in; "&gt;&lt;img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_qY9DSyjj8Ro/TUtOYzRfZAI/AAAAAAAAB3Y/MoKfumAjRTs/s400/pinholes2.png" style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 133px;" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5569631552161145858"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;&lt;meta equiv="CONTENT-TYPE" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"&gt;  &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;     &lt;meta name="GENERATOR" content="OpenOffice.org 3.2  (Unix)"&gt;    &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;     &lt;!--        @page { margin: 0.79in }        P { margin-bottom: 0.08in }     --&gt;     &lt;/style&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;For a small hole (aperture) there is approximately one area of the object that will send rays to a particular part of the image.  Of course there is a very small angle of error for pinhole cameras made with millimeter sized pins.  As the hole increases in size, more rays are incident to the same section of film.  And finally, when the hole is big enough for the whole object to be seen through it (think window), no cohesive image is formed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;So if we make the hole small enough, then we can have all the clarity we want, right?  Well, I guess so.  It would have to be a very circular hole and it would only let in a very tiny amount of light making exposure times long.  How to fix this?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;Yea, you guessed it.  A lens is the answer.  It is able to focus light on its own.  Now we can collect more light and still make clear images.  But the catch is that it only works for a range of distances.  So again, lets consider a lens and the images of two objects at different distances.   &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_qY9DSyjj8Ro/TUtO6Js1a6I/AAAAAAAAB3g/6s0Nh2XYoFY/s1600/lenses2.png"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 200px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_qY9DSyjj8Ro/TUtO6Js1a6I/AAAAAAAAB3g/6s0Nh2XYoFY/s400/lenses2.png" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5569632125117098914"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;meta equiv="CONTENT-TYPE" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"&gt;  &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;     &lt;meta name="GENERATOR" content="OpenOffice.org 3.2  (Unix)"&gt;    &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;     &lt;!--        @page { margin: 0.79in }        P { margin-bottom: 0.08in }     --&gt;     &lt;/style&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;Ray drawing can be done with 3 simple rules (though two are needed in practice).   &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; rays that go in parallel to the axis go out through the focal point&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;meta equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"&gt; rays that go in through the focal point go out parallel (time reversal symmetry)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;meta equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"&gt; rays that go through the center are not altered&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;Using these rules, the first object which is at the proper distance for the film position and focal length of the lens is in focus.  However, the rays from the object further away do not converge at the film and so are out of focus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;Here its time for two experiments.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;1) &lt;b&gt;The Window Camera&lt;/b&gt; Go to a room with a single window and cover it with thick paper that has a single hole in it.  Given enough light, you should see an image on the far wall.  If not, hold a piece of white paper up close to the hole. [Edit: I just learned this has a name: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_obscura"&gt;camera obscura&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;2) &lt;b&gt;The Doorway Camera&lt;/b&gt; Now, find a lens and a doorway.  In one room, leave the light on and go to the far wall in the dark room.  Bring the lens to the wall until you can see an image.  The doorway is the aperature, lens the lens, and wall the film.  This demonstration is very simple and not too surprising.  BUT SO COOL.   I encourage it &lt;i&gt;vigorously&lt;/i&gt;.  The following pictures were taken of my images in case you can't find a lens. [Edit: I guess this falls under camera obscura too]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;Together, these two elements – aperture and lens – make a very good camera.  The lens is able to collect a lot of light and focus it on the film.  The aperture can enhance clarity by reducing the number of paths that light rays can take to your lens.  It also provides higher order corrections that come from the fact that the lens is probably not perfect.  That is, lenses are notorious for misbehaving around the edges and introduce displacements in the whole image as well as between the colors.  The aperture helps keep light from traveling through these edges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt; Next time, a very simple camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Matt</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 03 Feb 2011 19:50:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2011-02-03:posts/exploration-of-cameras-i.html</guid><category></category></item><item><title>Your Week in Seminars: Short Thanksgiving edition</title><link>http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/your-week-in-seminars-short-thanksgiving-edition.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Good Monday evening all, and welcome to another edition of Your Week in Seminars. Last week was a half week here in Cornell, but we still managed two talks, the general colloquium and the Wednseday-talk-on-Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday we had &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt; Charles Marcus&lt;/span&gt; of Harvard talk about &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Building Schrödinger's Chip&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a quantum computing talk. We don't actually have a quantum computing group in Cornell, but I've taken a couple of courses on it back home, and it's an interesting subject, although I've been a bit disillusion by the notable lack of problems solvable by quantum computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marcus started by talking about the wonders and insanities of quantum mechanics - the usual spiel about the two slit experiment, electrons passing through walls, and Schrödinger's cat. He said he dubbed the talk Schrödinger's chip because unlike cats, that appear to break when we put them in the kind of low-temperature vacuum conditions we like to do quantum experiments in, chips keep working pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next he introduced the concept of entanglement, which is at the basis of the whole concept of quantum computing. Entangled particles are two or more particles that do not have a definite quantum state, but are definitely in the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;same&lt;/span&gt; quantum state. If I take them apart and measure their state - say, spin up or down - then I do not know the answer, but as soon one turns &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;up&lt;/span&gt;, the other is &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;up&lt;/span&gt; as well, and if one is &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;down&lt;/span&gt; the other is immediately &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;down&lt;/span&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experimental side of quantum computing is all about making little quantum boxes that contain a small number of states (like up or down) and then making it possible to entangle two of those boxes together. Add up enough boxes, under some criteria that were posited a decade ago but still not achieved, and you have a quantum computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of the talk was a survey of the various state of the art boxes and the methods used to make them. For those keeping track, 15 is still the largest number factored by a quantum computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, I came in just in time for the second half of &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;John Terning&lt;/span&gt;'s talk on &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Monopoles, Anomalies, and Electroweak Symmetry Breaking&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not really ideal to go into the second half of a talk in Newman 311, and this one actually sounded like I missed some interesting stuff. The part that I heard was about adding magnetic monopoles to the standard model., Those lovely magnetic equivalents of the electric point charge that we all heard about in our undergraduate E&amp;amp;M course turn out to be surprisingly hard to integrate into basic particle theories, which is perhaps for the best as we have not detected them so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gist of what I got from the second half of the talk was that it is not enough to add a magnetic counterpart to the electric part of the standard model, but in fact one needs a magnetic QCD and Weak force as well. Under some conditions, this kind of configuration can work, and predict magnetic monopoles with TeV-scale masses - the kind we might see in the LHC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terning also talked about how these could be detected in the LHC. It turns out this isn't simple, because at TeV we would be producing monopole-anti-monopole  pairs just barely, and so without a lot of kinetic energy they would tend to collapse back on themselves and annihilate, creating what is essentially an omnidirectional shower of photons. He mentioned that one of the big detectors at the LHC - the CMS - was equipped to detect these kind of photon bursts, and so this another prediction or possibility that we can look forward to seeing or not seeing soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it for last week, kind of on the short side due to the holiday and so on. This week  is our last normal one, as the semester ends, but I'll have a couple more particle talks the week after that, as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Yariv</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 29 Nov 2010 18:51:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2010-11-29:posts/your-week-in-seminars-short-thanksgiving-edition.html</guid><category></category></item><item><title>Your Week in Seminars: One for Two Edition</title><link>http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/your-week-in-seminars-one-for-two-edition.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone and welcome to another week of talks here at the physics department. I was out of Ithaca for a bit this past week, so in this very special edition I'm going to present a full week's worth of seminars (one from last week and two from the previous week) in one post covering two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Colloquium two weeks ago was given by our own &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Csaba Csaki&lt;/span&gt;, who talked about &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Electroweak Symmetry Breaking and the Physics of the TeV Scale&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was essentially an overview of beyond-the-standard-model physics and the kind of things we expect out of the LHC. Csaba started off by reminding us of the Standard Model, our very successful model of particle physics that's withstood nearly every test over the last thirty or forty years. The Standard Model is a set of three gauge theories - three forces that a relayed by massless particles - along with the theory of electroweak symmetry breaking that explains why one of these powers, the Weak one, is relayed by massive particles. This theory is well-backed by experiment, with the exception of the crucial Higgs boson, the one that gives mass to those previously massless W and Z, which we hope to see soon in the LHC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few problems with the Standard Model, and the big one is the Hierarchy problem. Given what we know of symmetry breaking and how the W and Z get their masses, we expect elementary particles to have masses that correlate with the energy scale of the interaction that gives them this mass. Since that interaction is not one we see at low energies, we expect the elementary particles to be very massive. Since they are not, we conclude that there must be some symmetry that keeps them massless or nearly so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some solutions to this was mentioned, beginning with current-favorite supersymmetry. This extra symmetry relation bosons to fermions and vice versa works well to solve the original problem, but creates a few of its own, like the Little Hierarchy Problem - if there's all this new physics at energies just a little higher than we've been exploring, why don't we see its effects on the low energy physics? In other words, why does the non-sypersymmetry Standard Model work so well?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Csaba went on to mention some ways of solving these problems, such as burying the Higgs by allowing it to decay only in very specific ways. He also talked about a few more, like no-Higgs theories that accomplish electroweak symmetry breaking by different means, and extra-dimensional theories that allow us to give different energy scales to different forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the exciting thing about all of this is that we are likely to know a great deal of the answers soon, within the next few years, once the LHC starts giving data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday after it we had &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Sven Krippendorf&lt;/span&gt; from Cambridge talk about &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Particle Physics from local D-brane models at toric singularities&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a heavy string theory talk and I couldn't follow much of it. The  question at hand was how to get the Standard Model, or parts of it, out of string theory models, and the gist of the talk revolved around toric singularities in the spacetime that the string theory lives in. No, I'm not entirely sure what makes a singularity toric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a lot of colorful graphs and some explanations. At the end there seemed to be some analogy made between different types of singularities on the manifold in string theory language and different gauge theories in the quantum field theory language, with a way to map them to each other. Possibly exciting, but you'd have to ask a proper string theorist about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then just this last Friday, we had &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Rachel Rosen&lt;/span&gt; from Stockholm University talk about &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Phase Transitions of Charged Scalars and White Dwarf Stars&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a blackboard talk, which is always exciting and is usually more illustrative than Power Point ones. The subject was the thermodynamics of white dwarf stars - stars that are very dense and old, where fusion has mostly stopped and the only thing preventing the collapse of the star upon itself is the fermionic pressure of the electrons, that cannot fall into the same quantum states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The physical description of these stars is one of relatively free positive ions, specifically helium ions in this case, floating through a background of fermions. They are described by a quantum condensate, which has a good theory explaining it, but with the addition of Coulombic interaction between the ions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This state applies, specifically, to a subgroup of these stars that are mostly made of helium. This kind of ion condensate tends to crystallize depending on the ratio between the kinetic and potential Coulombic energy. Quantum effects, on the other hand, depend on some ratios of mass and charge between the ions. The only material where this applies turns to be helium, but luckily there are plenty of these helium-made white dwarfs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The derivation, as Rosen showed it, starts with a neutral Bose-Einstein condensate, which has a simple phase diagram - uncondensed above some critical temperature, and increasing condensation as the temperature is lowered to zero. The charged condensate introduces photons as it is usually done in field theory and follows the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is a more complicated phase diagram. Under the old Tc, the ions still condense, but things change above it. There is now some higher temperature above which there is no condensation, but in between there are two solutions to the equations of motions, a condensate and a non-condensed state, and both a local energy minima. This means that the transition into a condensate is not continuous, and this is a first order phase transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nice thing here is that we have such white dwarf stars to observe and we can compare this theory to observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it for these last two weeks. All you Americans out there have a good Thanksgiving, and I'll see you next week with two new seminars.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Yariv</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 2010 11:12:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2010-11-22:posts/your-week-in-seminars-one-for-two-edition.html</guid><category></category></item><item><title>Your Week in Seminars Dark Edition</title><link>http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/your-week-in-seminars-dark-edition.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to another week of seminars here in the physics department.  Our theme of the week is dark matter - where does it come from, how do we see it, and why is there so much of it. Along with that we have a little more AdS/CFT, seemingly continuing last week's subjects theme. All in all, it looks like seminars on similar subjects tend to condense here in the department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start with the Monday Colloquium, where &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Richard Schnee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; from Syracuse University told us about &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;What's the Matter in the Universe?  Direct Searches for WIMP Dark Matter&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dark matter, we'll recall, is the astrophysics name for any kind of matter that doesn't emit light - one that is not inside stars. Our knowledge of our own solar system, which has its mass concentrated almost entirely inside the sun, led us to expect that mass in the universe in general would behave similarly. It turns out that the motion of observed galaxies is not consistent with the mass we  measure them to have, and so we hypothesize the existence of non-luminary matter around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days dark matter is an object of interest not only for astrophysicists but for particle theorists as well. With our variety of beyond-the-standard models of the universe we try to account for dark matter, guess at its properties and explains why it is dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last quality is rather easy to explain, in fact. Our expectation of dark matter is simply that it does not interact electromagnetically, and so does not emit photons. If we also posit that it does not interact strongly, we are left with a particle that can only decay weakly, and so we might expect a lot of it to stick around. Of course, the particle must also have a mass, which is the original property we postulated for it, and so we are looking for the WIMP, the Weakly Interacting Massive Particle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schnee talked about the various ways we hope to see WIMPs in the coming decade, focusing on two avenues, the LHC and passive detectors trying to pick up cosmic particles passing through the Earth. WIMPs are by definitions hard to detect, because they interact only Weakly and thus only weakly. This means that we can't actually see them directly in our detectors, and we have to look for either missing energy in accelerator results, which we deduce has gone to them, or their effects on detectable particles in large particle reservoir, much as we would detect neutrinos. Of course, when we have such weak signals the art is in reducing the background noise, by putting them underground, using the least radioactive materials we can find, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last part of the talk revolved around two events in his own detector that seemed to be far enough above background level to be  WIMPs . Schnee then explained how statistical analysis proved in fact these many statistical outliers were, well, statistically expected, which I found very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a mention at the very end, of another  experiment called DAMA, which is looking for a "WIMP wind", checking for signals as the Earth moves through space in opposite directions, in a kind of modern parallel of the Michelson-Morley experiment. This one has actually shown a positive signal, though this is of course still controversial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday we had a local postdoc, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Enrico Pajer&lt;/span&gt;, talk about &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Striped holographic superonductor&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned AdS/CFT last week, and how it's induced some crossover between the condensed matter study of high-temperature superconductors and particle physics. This was one of those crossover seminars, with a few CM people in the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enrico spent about half of the talk introducing the audience to the basics of superconductors - there were a lot of discontent as people asked questions or had objections to statements which I imagine would have gone over more smoothly with a condensed matter crowd . The bottom line of the first half were three important attributes of high-temperature superconductors, being a strong coupling between the electrons, the existence of a quantum critical point and an inhomogeneity of the material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was then another general introduction of the AdS/CFT duality, and I'll send you to last week's summary (or the rest of the internet) if you want to hear more about that. Enrico was working on a field theory in AdS space and trying to apply the results to superconductors through the duality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, strong coupling and quantum criticalities are known features of the AdS theory, and the addition here was of striped inhomogeneity, where things change alone one axis only. This is incorporated into the AdS space by applying  boundary conditions, in particularl to the gauge field in the relevant field theory, and reading the results by applying Einstein's, Maxwells and the Klein-Gordon equations, in the bulk of the theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting feature that was reproduced from other, non-AdS theories, was the dependence of the  critical temperature Tc on the inhomogeneity. This is the temperature where superconductors turn into normal conductors, and previous work had shown that it would to drop as the scale of the inhomogeneity grows either very large or very small, and have some maximum point for a finite scale of inhomogeneity. Enrico's work showed a dropoff in Tc for  inhomogeneity on very small scales, giving the same qualitative behavior albeit with an exponential rather than logarithmic dropoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were more details and math then, as they  studied these inhomogeneities in the AdS model, trying to determine the conductivity along the stripes and perpendicular to them and so on, producing some promising results and promising to produce some more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally on Friday we had &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Kuver Sinha&lt;/span&gt; of Texas A&amp;amp;M talk about &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;The Cosmological Moduli Problem and Non-thermal Histories of the Universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;As mentioned above, this talk revolved around dark matter as well, though from a particle theory perspective. The trick in particle physics is always making sure that your solution to one problem, in this case dark matter, does not interfere with our solution to another problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other problem here was the baryon asymmetry, or the overabundance of matter compared with antimatter in the universe. In particle physics the two are generally sides of the same coin and we have no reason to prefer one or the other, and so we must have some reason that we only observe regular matter in the universe. There is a well-established model for this, called nucleosynthesis, and now when we explain the amount of dark matter in the universe we have to keep from interfering with it. And while we're at it, we might solve a third problem - why is the density of dark matter and regular matter in the universe on the same order of magnitude?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sinha went through this, presenting two models of baryon genesis, occurring at different times in the history of the universe, each with their own features problems. Finally, he suggested one solution to the coincidence problem that is non-thermal - that is, rather than configuring the equilibrium point of matter and dark matter to be similar separately, we have them coming from the same source with similar decay rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that was that for last week, as dark matter obscures the better-lit one. This week have a sweeping overview of particle physics, toric singularities on branes, and possibly some news from the LHC. See you in seven.
&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Yariv</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2010 15:46:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2010-11-08:posts/your-week-in-seminars-dark-edition.html</guid><category></category></item><item><title>Your Week in Seminars: Conformal Edition</title><link>http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/your-week-in-seminars-conformal-edition.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Another week has gone by here in Cornell. The last leaves are turning red, a hint of snow passed us on the weekend, and the undergrads have hit the streets and parties in minimal clothing, then did the same again next day wearing a set of cat ears. And in the physics department, we had the usual three talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the colloquium speaker was &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Holger Müller&lt;/span&gt; from UC Berkeley, talking about &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Gravitational Redshift, Equivalence Principle, and Matter Waves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The center of the talk was Muller's experimental device, an atom interferometer. Many of you will remember the Michelson-Morley interferometer, the device used to disprove the existence of the ether. A light-interferometer essentially takes a beam of light, splits it in two and then merges it back again, using the result of the interference between the two parts to learn something about the relative difference between the optical paths taken by the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The atom interferometer, then, performs a similar function with atom wavefunctions. An atom is shot up into the air and a laser is directed towards it and calibrated to interact with the atom half the time. The atom's wavefunction is split two trajectories, at the end of which another laser is calibrated to bring the two paths back together. The detector can then measure the path difference between the two trajectories, and as we have excellent ways of measuring time and the mass and  energy of the atom, this amounts to a very accurate measurement of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;, the free-fall constant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muller went on to show how his team has been using the interferometer to perform very accurate measurements of General Relativity, from its isotropy to the universality of free fall motion for objects of different masses. There were some neat tricks described, and they mentioned the ability to measure those &lt;a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/09/microseconds-and-miles_7470.html"&gt;minute differences&lt;/a&gt; in gravity experienced by moving the system one meter upwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's always a little difficult to get excited about tests that &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;confirm &lt;/span&gt;an accepted theory, especially one like General Relativity, but I think this is important work. To paraphrase the words of fellow Virtuos Jared, GR is always going to be right up until we find where it breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;David Kaplan&lt;/span&gt; talked about &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Conformality Lost&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk was about QCD, but not about QCD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the features of QCD, or really field theories in general, is the running of the coupling constants. Where in classical theories the strength of the interaction between two particles is constant and depends only on the distance between them, field theory shows us how the strength of the interaction changes with the energy of the participating particles. This is crucial, for instance, for theories of grand unification that posit that the known forces are all the same at very high energies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In QCD, in particular, the running of the constant also has to with confinement and asymptotic freedom. Confinement is the notion that quarks can never break free of each other, and so we never observe them alone in nature, only within particles such as protons, neutrons, baryons and mesons. Asymptotic freedom is the notion that at high energies, if we collide another particle with a quark, it behaves as if it was free of other influence. If we associate long distances with low energy and short distances with high energy, we can see how the coupling must flow from very small at one end to very large at the other end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting things about the running of the coupling is that it defines a scale for the theory. If the coupling is different for particles of energy &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,  then we can choose some value of the coupling and describe our energy in relation to the energy relative to this scale. Theories without running coupling are called &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;conformal&lt;/span&gt; and have no natural scale. QCD, it seems, behave this way if you take it all the way to asymptotic freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaplan talked about the investigation of this conformal stage of the theory, its existence and inexistence. As an analog he showed  a quantum-mechanical system of a particle in a Coulombic, potential. The minimum energy of this system is given by solution of a quadratic equation, which can have either two solutions, one or none, depending on the relation between the mass of the particle and the strength of the potential. A scale exists in this case only if there are two solutions: a single energy is meaningless, of course, because we can always add a constant, but if there's two of them then the difference defines a scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This toy model, it turns out, can be analogous to a QCD with the equivalent parameter being the relative number of flavors (kind of particles) and colors (different charges in the theory, red, blue and green in our regular QCD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a number of interesting results from this model, the most exciting one, perhaps,  being the possible existence of a "mirror" QCD theory beyond the conformal point of QCD, a sort of theory with a different number of colors and different gauge groups. Kaplan ended his talk by talking of at least one possible candidate for this mirror theory that they had recently found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, on Friday, we had &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Ami Katz&lt;/span&gt; from Boston University talk about &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;CFT/AdS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AdS/CFT has been a big buzzword for the last decade or so. The CFT here stands for conformal field theory of  the kind  mentioned in the previous summary, and AdS stands for Anti-de Sitter space, a geometry of spacetime possible in general relativity. The slash in between stands for a duality that allows results from one theory to be interpreted in the other and vice versa. This has some exciting implications since it allows us to use each theory in the regime where we can solve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particle theorists are, in general, trying to use the CFT to solve for high-energy theories that behave like AdS. Katz had apparently rewritten the duality as CFT/AdS, to signal that he was asking the opposite question, starting with a CFT and asking whether it is a good fit for the duality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large part of the talk was dedicated to making an analogy from CFTs into conventional field theories. We know pretty well when a field theory is a good description of reality and when it tends to break down. This has to do, usually, with some cutoff energy, a scale at which new physics comes into play. As long as we stay at energies far below that cutoff, the effects of the unknown physics will be a small correction to the calculations we make with our known physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In CFTs, we had just said, there is no energy scale, and so the question must be different. The relevant question, apparently, is the dimensionality of operators - not what their energy scale is, but how they scale with a change of energy. For instance, a derivative behaves like inverse distance, and distance behaves like inverse energy, so a single derivative scales linearly in energy, while a double derivative scale quadratically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't understand much past the half-point of this lecture, but the bottom line appeared to be that a well-behaved CFT has a gap in its operators dimensionality, allowing us to focus on one operator and plenty of its derivatives before coming to the scaling of the next operator. This kind of gap allows our perturbative corrections to remain perturbative when we go to the AdS side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it for last week, with its conformal ups and down. As usual, we're past the first seminar of the new week, which was non-wimpy talk about WIMPs. Still ahead this week are superconductors (and more AdS/CFT, presumably) and some non-thermal histories of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(that is, of course, if I don't freeze first - temperatures have dropped below zero already. It's so much colder when you work in Celsius)&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Yariv</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2010 17:58:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2010-11-01:posts/your-week-in-seminars-conformal-edition.html</guid><category></category></item><item><title>Your Week in Seminars Fermionic Edition</title><link>http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/your-week-in-seminars-fermionic-edition.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Good evening, and welcome to the second edition of YWiS. Last week I took in the full range of seminars, from colloquium to Friday lunch. I don't know if I can say I took in the full content of these talks as well, but let's see what I  learned&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday we had &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Andrew Millis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; from Columbia University talk about &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Materials with Strong Electronic Correlations: The (Theoretical) End of the Beginning?&lt;/span&gt; (I think the subtitle wasn't actually  there in the talk itself).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a condensed matter theory talk, and like all condensed matter talks it started off with the phase diagram for cuprates and a mention of the illustrious pseudogap, the Dark Energy of condensed matter. The pseudogap is a phase of cuprates - the materials that make high-temperature superconductors - that occurs at about the same concentration of defects as superconductivity but at a higher temperature. It is a little-understood phase that sits between two well-understood phases (antiferromagnetism and Fermi liquid) and perhaps holds some answers to the nature of high-temperature superconductivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millis started with the pseudogap picture and a short overview of the current state of condensed matter theory. He claimed that perhaps some of the phases of matter in question have local, short-range ordering, but no overarching long-range order in the system, and that the investigation of these phases should take this into account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of this introduction he asked why we cannot easily solve the problems of condensed matter. The basic equations that govern the interactions in the field are known - the electromagnetic potential and Schrödinger's equation - and we should be able to just plug them into a computer and calculate away. The trouble, as Millis presented it, comes from the fermionic nature of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we're trying to calculate, in metals, is the behavior of the electrons running through the bulk of the metal. Electrons are fermions, which means that no two can have the same quantum numbers, that is no two can be in the same place with the same momentum and spin. It turns out that the configurations with lowest energies tend to be symmetric, with many particles in the same position. Finding low-energy configurations that put every particle in a different place is much harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't get a lot more from this talk. Millis went on to suggest a method that avoids tackling the problem directly, but rather solves an analogous one that we can translate to into a solution. I believe that there was some talk of a local, rather than global, solution, and of the Hubbard model, which is a popular approximation used in modeling electrons in a solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I phased in and out of this talk, but I'd peg my Understanding at 25 minutes, and my Interest at about 35 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wedenesday particle talk was by &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Jesse Thaler&lt;/span&gt; from MIT. He talked about &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Aspects of Goldstini&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;.&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Goldstini is the Italian plural form of goldstino, which is the fermionic version - we put "ino" at the end of fermionic particles, influenced by the neutrino - of the Goldstone boson. A Goldstone boson is a massless particle that we find in theories of spontaneous symmetry breaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a popular concept in particle physics, which springs from the concept of an unstable energy maximum. Imagine a pencil standing on its tip, a system which is symmetric in every direction. The pencil is unstable, though, and left  by itself it would fall down in any one of the equivalent directions around it. Once it has fallen, it's broken the symmetry and created one preferred direction. Thus the symmetry of the system is broken when one direction is chosen spontaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sort of thing is at the bottom of our understanding the electroweak force, and pops up quite a bit in particle physics. When it does, we expect a Goldstone boson, a massless particle that roughly corresponds to spinning the fallen-down pencil around its tip. The goldstini is the fermionic version of that particle which springs from the breaking of supersymmetry - the symmetry that relates fermions and bosons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goldstino, then, is well known and accepted in common theories of supersymmetry. It breaks supersymmetry, and then interacts with the gravitino - another fermion, which mediates the force of gravity - to become massless. Thaler's work posits more than one goldstino, hence, goldstini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we have more than one goldstino? By breaking supersymmetry more than once. We do this by imagining several "sectors" in our theory, different sets of fields (particles) that break supersymmetry but don't interact with each other significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you work through this model it turns out that you can have several goldstini. Also, as the original goldstini lost its mass by giving it to the gravitino, and the gravitino is now satisfied, the new goldstini get to keep their mass, which turns out to be exactly twice that of the (satisfied) gravitino.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thaler then discussed three possible scenarios for this mass, and what we would expect to see at the LHC in each case. The important thing, it turns out, is how this mass compares with that of the lightest ordinary superpartner, the first supersymmetry-related particle we expect to see in the LHC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the mass of the goldstini is very small, they will not come into play as the LOSP will decay into particles we already know. If the mass of the goldstini is too large, then the LOSP cannot decay into it. But if the mass is in some goldstinilocks region in-between, things become interesting and we can expect to see evidence of the gravitino and the goldstini, and distinctly see one having double the mass of the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed a good portion of this talk, with Understanding of 30 minutes all in all, and perhaps 45 minutes of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the Friday particle theory lunch had a talk by our own &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;David Curtin&lt;/span&gt;, one of Csaba's grad students. He talked about &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Solving the gaugino mass problem in Direct Gauge Mediation&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came into this one to follow more of it, on account of the speaker being a student, but ended up following very little as it was technical and above my level. It revolved, again, around supersymmetry breaking. David does model building, which means he starts out with some acceptable results, i.e. the universe as we know it, and tries to tinker up a combination of particles and interactions that would reproduce it, one portion at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What he was trying to build this time was a metastable level in the broken supersymmetric potential. If we think back to our pencil, we had an unstable maximum, the pencil standing on its tip, and a minimum point, the pencil laying on the table, from which it cannot fall. But we can also imagine a midpoint - perhaps resting one side of the pencil on a book. It can't fall any further right away, but there is another, preferred position lying flat on the table. That's what we call a metastable energy level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, the metastable level has some desirable outcomes within the context of supersymmetry, and the talk revolved around the ways we have of getting the right energy structure to our system while avoiding things we don't want in our models - arbitrary particle masses, a large number of new particles, or anything blatantly unphysical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Understanding here was quite close to 0, as the technicalities were beyond me. (in fact, the pre-seminar  discussion was about soccer, so one might say my understanding was negative). I probably kept trying to follow for about half the talk, or 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it for last week. This week we can expect gravity, (heavy!) Conformality Lost (literary!) and CFT/AdS (buzzwordy!). And hopefully less headscratching and more nodding in a agreement.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Yariv</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 25 Oct 2010 11:56:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2010-10-25:posts/your-week-in-seminars-fermionic-edition.html</guid><category></category></item><item><title>Paradigm Shifts 3: With a Vengence</title><link>http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/paradigm-shifts-3-with-a-vengence.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The last shift I wanted to present is best explained at &lt;a href="http://tauday.com/"&gt;http://tauday.com/&lt;/a&gt; .

An issue that is central to the day to day life of the average grad student. The subject of free food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average graduate student in an American university shops for food 0.7 times per semester, paying a total of $13.22. He eats an average of three vegetables and one fruit, all at home during Thanksgiving. He turns his oven on once per year while trying to ascertain if the power is out or the light bulb in the kitchen needs to be replaced. The rest of his nutrition is made up entirely of free donuts, bagels and pizza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The place to get all this free food, naturally, is various department talks and seminars. And while we're there, we may as well try to learn some physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that noble goal in mind, I'd like to welcome you to the first edition of Your Week in Seminars, where I shall endeavor to relay the content of the weekly seminars I attend in Cornell. On an average week this will be one general interest colloquium and two particle theory talks. One of my colleagues may want to take up the LASSP (Condensed Matter) talk or any of the other seminars going around in the department&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll try to relate what I got out of each talk, with more words than equations and with no figures. I'll aim for a general audience level but I think I'm likely to end up at a physics undergrad or a popular-science-savvy level, as technical terms are bound to be thrown about. If there's one you don't know, feel free to ask over in the comments or take this as an opportunity to delve into Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll also provide two handy metrics to the quality of the talk, my Interest Level, defined as the amount of time before I start playing with my phone, and my Comprehension level, defined as the amount of time where I was still following the speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week there was no colloquium due to Fall break, so this post will cover just the Wednesday and Friday &lt;a href="http://lepp.cornell.edu/Events/ParticleTheory/WebHome.html"&gt;particle seminars&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday we had &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;David Kagan&lt;/span&gt; from Columbia University tell us about &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Conifunneling - Stringy Tunneling Between Flux Vacua.
&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;As you may know, string theory demands that our universe have a large number of dimensions, generally 10 or 11, to avoid such nastiness  mass particles. To bridge the gap between the theoretical and observed  number of dimensions (four) one has to "compactify" the extra dimensions, that is, to posit that they have some shape and size and write down an effective four-dimensional theory  that takes their presence into account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This compactification creates an energy surface, or some effective potential in space. What we call "vacuum", the ground state of the universe, rests in one of the minimum points of that potential, as ground levels are wont to do. But it need not be the absolute minimum, just a local one, and where there are local minima in a quantum theory we know that there is also tunneling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kagan, then, talks of tunneling between these local energy minima created by compactification of the extra dimensions of string theory. This tunneling, from what I gathered, can be described as an evolution in time of the manifold, the geometric layout of spacetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main conceit of the talk was that this evolution takes the manifold into the form of a "conifold", which is a manifold with a conic singularity.  This conifold then nucleates a 5d-brane; branes are a objects in string theory that have some dimensionality less than that of the entire spacetime. After creating this object, the conifold transforms back into a non-singular manifold, but one where the vacuum is in another energy minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can visualize this process by  thinking of spacetime as an elastic sheet of  of sorts, pinched at a point and pulled. It is deformed, creating an elongated cone-like area, until finally it tears, emitting a five-dimensional brane, and reverting back to its original form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was some discussion  at the end which mostly went over my head, but  at some point  Henry Tye, Liam and Maxim were trying to figure out whether the tunneling is necessarily done via a conifold or whether Kagan was just describing what happens if it does. The conclusion, I believe, was that it is the latter case, though Kagan said they have some good arguments on why the conifold tunneling had to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest: 40 minutes.
Understanding: 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday we had &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Zvi Lipkin&lt;/span&gt; from the Weizmann Institute  tell us about &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Heavy quark hadrons and exotics, a challenge for QCD&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk revolved around the constituent quark model for QCD. Our usual picture of hadrons is one of two or three valence quarks sitting in a sea of gluons and virtual quark-antiquark pairs, due to the strong interactions of Strong Interaction. Lipkin's work focuses on trying to abstract this sea away and focus on the valence quarks as if we were discussing a hydrogen-atom-like system of two particles and a potential between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of treatment allows us to maximize the use of flavor symmetries. Flavor is QCD-speak for "type of particle", that is, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;up&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;down&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;strange&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;charm&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;bottom&lt;/span&gt; quarks. Using the constituent quark model we may be able to say things like "the difference between the B&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; and the B&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; (mesons made up of an anti-b and an s or d quark, respectively) is the same as the difference between the Ξ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; and the Σ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;" (baryons made up of uss and uds quarks, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Don't take that last example too seriously - I made it up by looking at lists of baryons and mesons. But that was the gist of the talk)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipkin showed done by him and Marek Karliner, (who taught me differential equations in Tel Aviv) including lots of numbers nicely matching between their theory and experiment as well as a less-convincing attempt to characterize the two-body potential in this two-body problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the talk he also mentioned the X(3872) seen by the Belle experiment. This is a particle that does not seem to fit into our regular models as either a baryon or a meson, and Lipkin suggested that this might be a "tetraquark," a combination of two quarks and two antiquarks. This kind of exotic hadron has been talked about for a long time, and there was some excitement a few years ago with the discovery and eventual un-discovery of the Θ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; pentaquark. (made up of four quarks and an antiquark)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest: 60 minutes. (I was sitting in the front and could not politely take out the phone)

Ever find out when you're playing chess that the Queen you reached for is actually a pawn? Probably not. But most chess games aren't affected by the weirdness of the quantum world. This one is:
&lt;a href="http://research.cs.queensu.ca/Parallel/QuantumChess/QuantumChess.html"&gt;http://research.cs.queensu.ca/Parallel/QuantumChess/QuantumChess.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Sam</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2010 21:48:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2010-09-08:posts/quantum-chess-.html</guid><category></category></item><item><title>Solar Sails Addendum I</title><link>http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/solar-sails-addendum-i.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;As requested, below is an explicit evaluation of the silly looking integral in &lt;a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/05/solar-sails-i.html"&gt;Solar Sails I&lt;/a&gt;.  If you just want some hints to do the integral, see &lt;a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/05/solar-sails-addendum-ii.html"&gt;Solar Sails Addendum II&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we present a step-by-step solution of the differential equation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \frac{dr}{dt} = \left[ \frac{2\alpha}{m} \left( \frac{1}{r_0} - \frac{1}{r} \right)\right]^{1/2} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just a separable equation, so we rearrange to get an integral equation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \int_{r_0}^{r_f} \frac{dr}{\left[ \frac{2\alpha}{m} \left( \frac{1}{r_0} - \frac{1}{r} \right)\right]^{1/2}} =\int_{0}^{t}dt$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see that the right hand side here will just evaluate to t.  Let's rearrange the left hand side to get the integration variable to be dimensionless. This is important because it allows the integral to just be a number, with all the unit-dependent terms pulled outside.  So we have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \int_{r_0}^{r_f} \frac{dr}{\left[ \frac{2\alpha}{mr_0} \left( 1 - \frac{r_0}{r} \right)\right]^{1/2}} =t$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\noindent Now we can do a change of variables to get the dimensionless variable u = r/r0.  This is just giving us our distance in terms of our initial distance.  In the problem I took r_0 to be 1 AU.  So u just gives our distance now in terms of AU:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \int_{1}^{u_f} \frac{du}{\left[ \frac{2\alpha}{m{r_0}^3} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{u} \right)\right]^{1/2}} =t$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So lets set&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ k = (m{r_0}^3}/{2 \alpha)^{1/2} ,$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which just gives&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ k\int_{1}^{u_f} \frac{du}{\left[ \left( 1 - \frac{1}{u} \right)\right]^{1/2}} =t$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we are ready to get started!  Typically, when I see something with a square root in the denominator that's giving me trouble, I just blindly try trig substitutions.  Let's try u = [csc(x)]^2, so 1/u  = [sin(x)]^2 and du = -(csc x)^2 * cot x, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \int_{1}^{u_f} \frac{du}{\left[ \left( 1 - \frac{1}{u} \right)\right]^{1/2}} =\int_{x_0}^{x_f} \frac{-2\csc^2x \cot x dx}{\left(1-\sin^2x \right)^{1/2}} = \int_{x_0}^{x_f} -2\csc^3x dx ,$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where x_0 = pi/2 and x_f = arcsin u_f .  The last equality above just comes from simplifying the trig expressions.  So now how do we solve this "easier" problem?  As a wise man once said, "When in doubt, integrate by parts."  So let's try that.  Expanding out a bit we see that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ -\int_{x_0}^{x_f} \csc^3x dx = \int_{x_0}^{x_f}\csc x \left(-\csc^2x \right)dx $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remembering that integration by parts goes like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \int u dv = uv - \int v du $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we can set u = csc x and v = \cot x$ to get&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \int_{x_0}^{x_f}\csc x \left(-\csc^2x \right)dx = \csc x \cot x \Big |_{x_0}^{x_f} - \int_{x_0}^{x_f} \cot x \left(-\csc x \cot x \right) dx $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which is just&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ -\int_{x_0}^{x_f}\csc^3x dx = \csc x \cot x \Big |_{x_0}^{x_f} + \int_{x_0}^{x_f} \cot^2 x \csc x dx $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remembering that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \cot^2 x = \csc^2 x -1 ,$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ -\int_{x_0}^{x_f}\csc^3x dx = \csc x \cot x \Big |_{x_0}^{x_f} + \int_{x_0}^{x_f} \left(\csc^2 x - 1 \right) \csc x dx $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which we can expand to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ -\int_{x_0}^{x_f}\csc^3x dx = \csc x \cot x \Big |_{x_0}^{x_f} - \int_{x_0}^{x_f} \csc x dx + \int_{x_0}^{x_f} \csc^3 x dx$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is just what we want!  Rearranging we now have that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ -2\int_{x_0}^{x_f}\csc^3x dx = \csc x \cot x \Big |_{x_0}^{x_f} - \int_{x_0}^{x_f} \csc x dx$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remembering that the integral for csc is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \int \csc x dx =-\ln | \csc x + \cot x| + C $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and evaluating our limits we have that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ -2\int_{x_0}^{x_f}\csc^3x dx = \csc x_f \cot x_f - \csc x_0 \cot x_0 +\ln \left( \frac{| \csc x_f + \cot x_f|}{| \csc x_0 + \cot x_0|} \right) $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we just need to evaluate at x_0 = pi/2 and x_f = arcsin u_f.  We can draw a right triangle with far angle x_f, hypoteneuse of length sqrt{u}, and legs of length 1 and sqrt{u-1} to see that csc x_f = sqrt{u} and cot x_f = sqrt{u-1}, so&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ -2\int_{x_0}^{x_f}\csc^3x dx = \sqrt{u}\sqrt{u-1} + \ln{ | \sqrt{u} + \sqrt{u-1}|} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is what we have sought from the beginning.  Using the last two equations on the first page we see that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ t = k\int_{1}^{u_f} \frac{du}{\left[ \left( 1 - \frac{1}{u} \right)\right]^{1/2}} = k\left[-2\int_{x_0}^{x_f}\csc^3x dx \right] = k \left[\sqrt{u}\sqrt{u-1} + \ln{ | \sqrt{u} + \sqrt{u-1}|} \right] $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plugging back in our value of k, we have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ t = \left(\frac{m{r_0}^3}{2\alpha} \right)^{1/2}\left[\sqrt{u}\sqrt{u-1} + \ln{ | \sqrt{u} + \sqrt{u-1}|} \right] $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simplifying a bit and dropping the absolute value bars since u will always be bigger than u-1, we have our final answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ t = \left(\frac{m{r_0}^3}{2\alpha} \right)^{1/2}\left[\sqrt{u(u-1)} + \ln{ \left( \sqrt{u} + \sqrt{u-1}\right)} \right] $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where u = r / r_0 is our non-dimensional distance measurement.  And this is (up to some rearranging) exactly what we get in the initial post. 
&lt;div&gt;

The full solution is given in &lt;a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/05/solar-sails-addendum-i.html"&gt;Solar Sails Addendum I&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Here we present a schematic solution of the differential equation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \frac{dr}{dt} = \left[ \frac{2\alpha}{m} \left( \frac{1}{r_0} - \frac{1}{r} \right)\right]^{1/2} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just a separable equation, so we rearrange to get an integral equation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \int_{r_0}^{r_f} \frac{dr}{\left[ \frac{2\alpha}{m} \left( \frac{1}{r_0} - \frac{1}{r} \right)\right]^{1/2}} = \int_{0}^{t}dt$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here it's nice to non-dimensionalize, so our integration variable is just a number (with no units attached).  This allows us to get the integral into a form like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ k\int_{1}^{u_f} \frac{du}{\left[ \left( 1 - \frac{1}{u} \right)\right]^{1/2}} = t$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for appropriate values of k and u. Now we are ready to get started!  Typically, when I see something with a square root in the denominator that's giving me trouble, I just blindly try trig substitutions.  After an appropriate trig substitution, we get something of the form&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \int_{1}^{u_f} \frac{du}{\left[ \left( 1 - \frac{1}{u} \right)\right]^{1/2}} = \int_{x_0}^{x_f} -2\csc^3x dx$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now how do we solve this "easier" problem?  As a wise man once said, "When in doubt, integrate by parts."  So let's try that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \left[ \mbox{HINT:} -\int_{x_0}^{x_f} \csc^3x dx = \int_{x_0}^{x_f}\csc x \left(-\csc^2x \right)dx \right]$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remembering that integration by parts goes like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \int u dv = uv - \int v du $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we can pick appropriate values of u and v to get something nice, which eventually leads to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ -\int_{x_0}^{x_f}\csc^3x dx = \csc x \cot x \Big |_{x_0}^{x_f} - \int_{x_0}^{x_f} \csc x dx + \int_{x_0}^{x_f} \csc^3 x dx$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is just what we want!  Rearranging we now have that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ -2\int_{x_0}^{x_f}\csc^3x dx = \csc x \cot x \Big |_{x_0}^{x_f} - \int_{x_0}^{x_f} \csc x dx$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evaluating our integrals, we see that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ -2\int_{x_0}^{x_f}\csc^3x dx = \sqrt{u}\sqrt{u-1} + \ln{ | \sqrt{u} + \sqrt{u-1}|} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is what we have sought from the beginning.  Plugging back in to our earlier equations and rearranging gives&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ t = \left(\frac{m{r_0}^3}{2\alpha} \right)^{1/2}\left[\sqrt{u(u-1)} + \ln{\left( \sqrt{u} + \sqrt{u-1}\right)} \right] $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where u = r / r_0 is our non-dimensional distance measurement.  And this is (up to some algebra) exactly what we get in the initial post. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
On &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Kippur#Eve"&gt;Yom Kippur eve&lt;/a&gt; Quantum walked over to  Einstein's house to seek forgiveness. "I'm not home," shouted Einstein  from behind a closed door. On the way home people taunted him and  somebody even hit him with an empty can of coke. Quantum pretended not  to care, but deep inside he was really hurt. Nobody really gets Quantum,  everybody hates him. "You parasite" people cry out when he's walking  down the street, "why are you dodging the draft?" - "I wanted to  enlist," Quantum tries to say, "but they wouldn't take me, because I'm  so small." Not that anybody listens to Quantum. Nobody listens to  Quantum when he tries to speak up for himself, but when he says  something that can be misconstrued, oh, then suddenly everybody's paying  attention. Quantum can say something innocent like "wow, what a cat!"  and right away the news says he's making provocations and run off to  talk to Schrodinger. And anyway, the media hates Quantum most,  because once when he was interviewed in Scientific American Quantum said  that the observer affects the observed event, and all the journalists  thought he was talking about the coverage of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Intifada"&gt;Intifada&lt;/a&gt; and claimed he  was deliberately inciting the masses. And Quantum can keep  talking until tomorrow about how he didn't mean it and he has no  political affiliation, nobody believes him anyway. Everybody knows he's  friends with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuval_Neeman#Political_career"&gt;Yuval Ne'eman.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
A lot of people think Quantum is  heartless, that he has no feelings, but that's not true at all. On  Friday, after a documentary on Hiroshima, he was on the expert panel.  And he couldn't even speak. Just sat in front of the open mic and cried,  and all of the viewers at home, that don't really know Quantum,  couldn't understand that Quantum was crying, they just thought he was  avoiding the question. And the sad thing about it is, even if Quantum  writes dozens of letters to the editors of all the scientific journals  in the world and proves beyond any doubt that for the whole atomic bomb  thing he was just being used and he never thought it would end this way,  it wouldn't help him, because nobody really gets quantum. Least of all  the physicists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: georgia;"&gt;Somebody I talked to yesterday about what should the topic of my post be suggested that I should write something about cosmology, in particular the Big Bang and the ultimate fate of the universe. Being mostly interested in condensed matter, I am by no means an expert in cosmology (I’ll leave that to Corky). However, I will not abandon the request, but instead, spin it in a more condensed matter direction, by talking about Entropy.

&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: georgia;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: georgia;"&gt;Entropy is a quantity that measures disorder. The more ordered your system is, i.e. the less ways you can arrange the constituents of your system, the less entropy you have and vice versa. I like to use the example of how messy my room is to visualize this. When I clean my room, I would pick up the random articles of clothing, books, etc and put them in the places where they belong. Now imagine, I stopped cleaning my room for a couple of weeks. This would result in clothes on the ground, books on my bed, empty bottles on my desk, etc. anything can be anywhere. This means that there are more ways for my personal belongings to be arranged when my room is messy than when my room is clean (when everything would be at its place), so the entropy increases as the messiness of my room increases. Now, notice that left on its own (i.e. if I don’t put the conscious effort to put some order in my room once in a while) the entropy of the system that is my room increases with time. This is, in fact, the essence of one of the most fundamental (if not the most fundamental) laws of nature – The Second Law of Thermodynamics, which states that left on its own, the entropy of any system increases with time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: georgia;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: georgia;"&gt;I know what you are thinking, “What does this talk about the messiness of your room and the law of increasing entropy has to do with the universe, the Big Bang and the universe’s ultimate fate?” Ok, here you go, read this short story by the greatest sci-fi writer Isaac Asimov: &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/84LN"&gt;The Last Question.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: georgia;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: georgia;"&gt;Now that you’ve read this story (if you haven’t, please do), we can discuss some physics (or actually, some philosophy, but you know, sometimes there isn’t that much difference between the two). Einstein, with his Theory of Relativity, showed that the concept of time is not absolute, and time can be treated simply as another coordinate, much like the three spatial coordinates that define the three dimensional space we are used to. (A more in-depth explanation of the Theory of Relativity will be the topic of one of the next posts.) However, despite the relativity of time, the arrow of time is always well-defined. We can always tell future from past by measuring the entropy and applying the Second Law of Thermodynamics. At the instance of the Big Bang, the entropy was zero. Since then (about 13.8 billion years ago) the entropy of the universe has been increasing until it will eventually reach its maximum value, at which point all the matter of the universe would be evenly distributed and no physical process would be possible. Time eventually stops, resulting in the “heat death” of the universe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: georgia;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: georgia;"&gt;I believe that one of the most unsettling parts of the Bing Bang theory is the question of what caused the Big Bang, and what was there before the Bing Bang. Having the arrow of time defined with regards to entropy, however, makes this question nonsensical… unless, of course, a Cosmic AC (or God) has managed to find the answer of how the entropy can be reversed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

My name is Nikolay, and as most of the others contributing to the blog, I am also a first-year graduate student in physics at Cornell.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div  style="font-family:georgia;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;So, what is my motivation to join the team headed by Mr. Alemi in contributing to the blog? I happen to have many friends that are not in physics. In fact, probably due to the fact that I graduated from a liberal arts college, many of my friends have never taken any physics beyond that one class in high school, which due to both the inherent difficulty of teaching physics at introductory level and the lack of good high school physics teachers was often an unpleasant experience that scared them away from physics for life.  Now, imagine what my difficulty is when on a daily basis I have to answer the question: “So what do you study/work on as a graduate student?” I usually try to come up with a sentence or two describing the essence of what I am doing without going into too many details, but even that is a daunting task. There seems to be a disconnect between the world in which a physicist lives and the general public. As Chad Orzel pointed out in the talk that motivated the creation of this blog, this is not the general public’s fault, but our fault as physicists of not really committing enough effort in relating our knowledge to the rest of the world.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div  style="font-family:georgia;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;In short, my goal is to create a series of posts about physics geared to people with no physics background that would build upon each other and culminate with a post providing an answer to the question of what my research project is beyond the generic words I would often resort to that would rather leave most people confused. I plan to use as little math as possible, which will not be an easy task considering that math is the language of choice for physics. However, mathematics is just a tool, and physics is not about equations and complicated algebra, but about how nature works, which we should be able to formulate in plain English. I know I am embarking on a difficult task, so wish me luck, and please leave your thoughts in the remarks section of the blog, since any feedback would be appreciated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Nik Zhelev</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 16 Apr 2010 16:36:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2010-04-16:posts/physics-for-non-physicists.html</guid><category></category></item></channel></rss>
