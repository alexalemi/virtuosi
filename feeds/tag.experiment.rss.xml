&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized the other day that I&amp;#8217;ve seen a lot of people talk about
research results, but it is much more rare that I see someone talk about
how we do research. I think that may be because, to us as scientists,
the process is second nature. We&amp;#8217;ve been doing it for years. Other folks
may be less familiar with the process though. With this in mind, I&amp;#8217;m
going to do a short series of posts focused on how we do an experiment.
Not the results, not so much the physics, but the process that we go
through to create, setup, and carry out an experiment. As my example
I&amp;#8217;ll use a short little experiment that I built from the ground up in
the last few weeks, that I&amp;#8217;m currently in the process of (hopefully)
wrapping up. Today I&amp;#8217;ll talk about the driving force behind almost any
experiment: The Question. It might be argued that there are two types of
experiments. There are those that set out to answer a specific question,
and those that set out to explore what happens under certain conditions
(explore some part of phase space). An example of the first type that
comes immediately to mind is the recently announced results from
&lt;a href="http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/04may_epic/"&gt;Gravity Probe
B&lt;/a&gt;
(&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GP&lt;/span&gt;-B). This was an experiment designed with one goal in mind, to test
the validity of einstein&amp;#8217;s theory of general relativity, specifically
geodesic precession and frame dragging. They asked the question, built
the apparatus, and then got results. Here&amp;#8217;s a spoiler from the article:
Einstein was right, to remarkable precision. I&amp;#8217;m going to mostly ignore
the second type of experiment. While very important, I argue that those
exploratory experiments are (almost?) always done on experimental
apparatus that was built for another experiment. You don&amp;#8217;t spend the
time, money, and energy to build an experimental apparatus without
having good evidence that it&amp;#8217;s worth doing, that is, without expecting
to see something. This brings me to The Question. The name might be
misleading, the motivation for an experiment might not be a question
(though it can usually be phrased as one). One common motivation is to
test theoretical predictions, as was the case with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GP&lt;/span&gt;-B. Theory without
experimental verification is empty. It may sound nice, but we can&amp;#8217;t
trust it unless we&amp;#8217;ve tested it against what nature actually does.
Sometimes theory develops because of experimental results, for example
the knowledge of the quantization of light came out of anomalous
experimental effects of the photoelectric effect and blackbody radiation
(among others). Other times, experiment develops to test theory, the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GP&lt;/span&gt;-B and the Large Hadron Collider for example. Another common
motivation is a question based on a physical observation, for example:
&lt;a href="http://physicsbuzz.physicscentral.com/2011/04/small-insects-paddle-through-air.html"&gt;how does a fly
fly&lt;/a&gt;?
That question is, as these things go, very simply stated. For an idea of
how complicated they can get, just take a look at any recent collection
of articles from any physics journal, wherein we find things like the
form and source of &amp;#8216;itinerant magnetism in FeAs&amp;#8217; (grabbed from a recent
Phys. Rev. B article). I classify a third type of question, one that is
more process based: &amp;#8220;How can we do X?&amp;#8221;. This third category is where the
question that motivates (at least in the broad sense) the experiment I&amp;#8217;m
going to describe comes from. I can phrase it as: &amp;#8220;How can we
successfully cryopreserve biological samples?&amp;#8221; For those unfamiliar with
biological cryopreservation, this is something I discussed &lt;a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/05/cryopreservation.html"&gt;almost a
year
ago&lt;/a&gt;.
From there, we get into smaller questions, most of those are type two,
based on physical observations. This particular small experiment has
grown out of my work on cryopreservation, and has more to do with the
structure of water on freezing. Over the past year, one of the projects
I&amp;#8217;ve been working on has been to measure the so called critical warming
rate of aqueous solutions. This is the rate at which you have to warm
vitreous aqueous solutions (see my earlier cryopreservation post for
more details) to prevent ice formation on warming. The question that has
grown out of this work is: how does the cooling history of my vitreous
sample affect the critical warming rate? Having arrived at the question,
we&amp;#8217;ll next discuss the&amp;nbsp;apparatus.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jesse</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2011 21:06:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2011-05-05:posts/anatomy-of-an-experiment-i-the-question.html</guid><category>question</category><category>cryopreservation</category><category>physics</category><category>experiment</category></item><item><title>Steak Dinner</title><link>http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/steak-dinner.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Sorry about the blog hiatus. During the summer, without teaching
classes, inspiration is harder to come by. But, tonight I cooked a
steak. I recently got a new digital meat thermometer. My plan was to
slowly cook the steak until the internal temperature got to be about 140
degrees Fahrenheit with the oven at 200 degrees, take it out, wrap in
tin foil, crank the oven to 500 degrees, stick it back in, and give it a
nice exterior, reaching an internal temperature of about 150 degrees
which would put it at about medium. After I put the steak into the oven
though, I started to watch the temperature go up on my digital
thermometer and thought, why not take data. And so I did. Here are the&amp;nbsp;results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFi924poROI/AAAAAAAAAMg/VSSuNTCh30g/s1600/steakdinner.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFi924poROI/AAAAAAAAAMg/VSSuNTCh30g/s400/steakdinner.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above you see the internal temperature of the steak as a function of
time. First some comments about the&amp;nbsp;graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The steak started at 37 degrees, the temperature of my&amp;nbsp;refrigerator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t start taking data until about 20 minutes&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The red dashed lines mark where I turned up the temperature of the
    oven. It started at 200 degrees, then 250, then 300, and in the
    final stretch, 500 with the&amp;nbsp;broiler.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The green dotted lines mark where I got impatient and opened the
    door to the over to check on the&amp;nbsp;food.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The yellow background denotes where the steak was outside of the
    oven resting in&amp;nbsp;tinfoil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now some comments on the&amp;nbsp;data&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can clearly see a change in the data when I changed the oven&amp;nbsp;temperature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opening the oven door really seems to slow down the cooking&amp;nbsp;process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The temperature of the center of the steak continues to rise after
    you take it out of the&amp;nbsp;oven.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In fact, curiously enough, the temperature of the center of the
    steak seems to have risen the quickest after it was taken out of the&amp;nbsp;oven.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I decided to look at the heating rate, computed by taking the
finite differences of my data points and propagating the&amp;nbsp;errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFi97yIEe9I/AAAAAAAAAMo/EzZ_kvRdb7U/s1600/heatrate.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFi97yIEe9I/AAAAAAAAAMo/EzZ_kvRdb7U/s400/heatrate.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you&amp;#8217;ll see, I really didn&amp;#8217;t have enough data points or a precise
enough thermometer to really see the changes in the heating rate.
Finally some comments about the&amp;nbsp;food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The steak was good. You&amp;#8217;ll notice I shot past 150, ended up with a
    temperature of about 160, and a steak that was nearly medium&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cooking the steak slowly like this yielded as pretty soft texture,
    akin to a roast. Heck, I essentially roasted the&amp;nbsp;steak.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The steak was served with asparagus and baked potatoes. As an
    interesting aside, the baked potatoes were in the oven along with
    the steak the whole time, but did not cook all the way through. I
    normally bake potatoes at 350 for about an hour, and here they were
    in a hot oven for over an hour and a half, half an hour of which was
    above 300, but they didn&amp;#8217;t cook&amp;nbsp;through.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I clearly have too much time on my hands. I have one more steak, and I
think I&amp;#8217;ll try a different cooking method. Maybe I&amp;#8217;ll have the patience
to take data again, we&amp;#8217;ll&amp;nbsp;see.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Alemi</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2010 21:20:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2010-08-03:posts/steak-dinner.html</guid><category>data</category><category>steak</category><category>fun</category><category>graph</category><category>experiment</category></item><item><title>Life as an Experimenter - Reflections</title><link>http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/life-as-an-experimenter-reflections.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been doing experimental physics for about three years. I started
during my sophomore year in college, went straight to graduate school,
and continued here (albeit not quite immediately). There are people out
there who have been doing this for a lot longer than I have, but I&amp;#8217;ve
gained a few insights, by working with said people, and through my own
experiences in the lab. I thought I&amp;#8217;d try to share a few of these, to
help illuminate the past few days I blogged about. &lt;strong&gt;Something Always
Goes Wrong&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#8217;s the nature of experimental science. Something always
goes wrong. It might be your equipment, it might be your sample, hell,
it might be something personal. But something will go wrong. Wednesday
was a prime example. Not only did I get soaked by rain and temporarily
lose my bike lock, but it took us 9 hours to really start taking data
due to equipment problems. I think this is endemic in what we&amp;#8217;re doing.
We&amp;#8217;re trying to investigate something that no one has ever done (at
least not quite exactly what we&amp;#8217;re doing). This means that we&amp;#8217;re usually
pushing the bounds of our equipment and setup. Not just that, but most
of the equipment is exceedingly complex, giving it many more places it
can break down. &lt;strong&gt;It&amp;#8217;s An Emotional Roller Coaster&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes nothing
works. At all. You try and try and you just can&amp;#8217;t make it work. Then
sometimes everything is going well. You&amp;#8217;re getting data, and not just
that, but the data looks good. Whether it&amp;#8217;s confirming or destroying
your expectations, you&amp;#8217;re finding out something new about the world.
It&amp;#8217;s exciting. You find something interesting and start chasing it.
However, you have to be careful. Often the result is not what you think
you&amp;#8217;re seeing. It&amp;#8217;s a false signal from your equipment, or attributable
to the background material doing something strange. Or you&amp;#8217;ve destroyed
the sample, and that&amp;#8217;s why it&amp;#8217;s not doing what you expect. You go up and
down quite a bit. &lt;strong&gt;It&amp;#8217;s Exhausting&lt;/strong&gt; Part of it is the long hours. But
really, 16 hour days are not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; bad. Sleeping 6.5-7 hours. I can
usually do that, no problem. So what&amp;#8217;s different when it&amp;#8217;s research? You
have to be thinking all the time. For 16 hours. In general, you can&amp;#8217;t
just push the button and wait. You need to look at the data while it
comes in, to determine what data to take next. Combine that with the
emotional up and down &amp;#8230; even though you&amp;#8217;re not necessarily
physically exhausted, you&amp;#8217;re mentally worn out. &lt;strong&gt;You Get More Questions
Than Answers&lt;/strong&gt; My undergraduate advisor would always say that when
you&amp;#8217;re doing research you generate three questions for every question
you answer. That&amp;#8217;s more or less true. It is very rare to go out and
answer all the questions you have. It is even more rare to not get more
questions. There&amp;#8217;s always more to learn. In many ways, that&amp;#8217;s great,
though a little frustrating. If we ran out of questions, we&amp;#8217;d probably
run out of a job. But there&amp;#8217;s always another twist that you didn&amp;#8217;t
expect nature to have, something else surprising you. That&amp;#8217;s why we do
it. There&amp;#8217;s no finality in research. We can&amp;#8217;t get all the answers, ever.
A lot of our time isn&amp;#8217;t data taking, but making/setting up our
equipment, analyzing data, and such things. Still, I hope that this
series of posts has given you a taste of what we scientists may do when
we&amp;#8217;re taking&amp;nbsp;data.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jesse</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jun 2010 15:50:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2010-06-19:posts/life-as-an-experimenter-reflections.html</guid><category>reflection</category><category>CHESS</category><category>experiment</category></item><item><title>Life as an Experimenter - Day Three</title><link>http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/life-as-an-experimenter-day-three.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Today marks the third and final day in our beam time at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHESS&lt;/span&gt;. I think
the circles under all of our eyes may take away from the glamor a bit,
but the right makeup specialist could fix that. If they ever make a
movie about us, which they should, I want to be played by some really
awesome british actor. I think that would be about right. Someone with a
strong jaw. In case it&amp;#8217;s not obvious, lack of sleep is getting to me a
little bit. Read on for the final few hours of our experiment.
Friday 6/18
&lt;strong&gt;9:07am&lt;/strong&gt; - Not sure if I didn&amp;#8217;t turn on my alarm, or turned it off
without noticing. But somehow I manage to jerk awake not too much later
than planned. Dragging a little bit. Get some food. No time for shower,
do that in a few hours. Only have to get through to noon.
&lt;strong&gt;9:41&lt;/strong&gt; - Leave house. Hop in car. Realize as I drive through that
there&amp;#8217;s a stop sign at a corner that I didn&amp;#8217;t see last night, mostly
hidden by trees. Very glad there wasn&amp;#8217;t any traffic.
&lt;strong&gt;9:54&lt;/strong&gt; - Arrive back at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHESS&lt;/span&gt;. Set up laptop to stream the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; game.
Get a report from Matt and Ryan. Looks like the data that was exciting
last night is actually repeatable, and though it is a small effect,
probably real. This is a very nice bonus for our experiment, we were
mostly expecting null results from that phase of things. Plan is to test
that more, run some experiments to make sure we&amp;#8217;re not seeing other,
more mundane, effects that would look the same with our collection
methods.
&lt;strong&gt;10:25&lt;/strong&gt; - I take over crystal mounting. Matt is busy with data, and
Ryan is not having luck with crystals this morning. That&amp;#8217;s how it goes.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; is down a goal. Morale low for that reason.
&lt;strong&gt;10:45&lt;/strong&gt; - Data taking going okay. Still seeing the effect, though
small. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; down 2 goals. Not good at all.
&lt;strong&gt;11:00&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; down 1 goal! Oh yes. Some experiment. We&amp;#8217;re almost done,
not paying too much attention any more. Everyone is slowing down.
&lt;strong&gt;11:20&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHESS&lt;/span&gt; staff members keep on wandering into our area and
staying to watch the game. Kind of fun. One got us an ethernet cable to
eliminate some of the pauses we were getting in the streaming using the
wireless. Set up a final run, determine if the effect is from what we
suspect (hope?) or from mundane causes. Need to pack up and be out in 40
minutes.
&lt;strong&gt;11:45&lt;/strong&gt; - Experiment finishes. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; is robbed! Should have been a
victory.
&lt;strong&gt;11:50&lt;/strong&gt; - Mad scramble to pack up equipment. Crystals, mounts,
computers, etc.
&lt;strong&gt;11:58&lt;/strong&gt; - Off the beam.
&lt;strong&gt;12:05pm&lt;/strong&gt;- Parking permit returned. On my way home. Taking the rest of
the day off.
I hope that you, dear reader, have enjoyed this brief taste of how
experiments go. I tried to let the emotions reflect what I actually was
feeling at the time, but often for the most harrowing/exciting parts
there was no time to write, so much of this has been upon reflection.
Tomorrow I hope to offer a few insights into how experiments usually
seem to go. A lot of people have never done experimental science, and
experimentation in movies is &lt;a href="http://xkcd.com/683/"&gt;very different&lt;/a&gt; from
what we actually do. Now it&amp;#8217;s time to sleep. And maybe watch the
England/Algeria&amp;nbsp;game.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jesse</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jun 2010 13:49:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2010-06-18:posts/life-as-an-experimenter-day-three.html</guid><category>CHESS</category><category>experiment</category></item><item><title>Life as an Experimenter - Day Two</title><link>http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/life-as-an-experimenter-day-two.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Today I&amp;#8217;m continuing my series on the life of an experimenter. Today is
the longest day, since we have beam time for all 24 hours. And after the
setbacks of yesterday, we feel compelled to use it to the utmost bit.
Read on for more tantalizing glimpses of the grit behind the glamor of
the rock-star-like lifestyle of an experimental physicist. Today had a
very different feel. Things were working, and that meant a lot of down
time waiting for data to collect. Despite the excitement of data coming
in, I was a little bored at points. Lots of internet use. Thursday 6/17
&lt;strong&gt;7:15am&lt;/strong&gt; - Alarm goes off. 6.5 hours of sleep? Up quickly, and eat and
shower. Run into a couple of my housemates that I normally don&amp;#8217;t. I
don&amp;#8217;t feel to tired. Which is good, because I don&amp;#8217;t usually do caffeine,
if I had to now, it might well mess me up. &lt;strong&gt;7:50&lt;/strong&gt; - Out of the house.
Taking my car, since my bike isn&amp;#8217;t working. &lt;strong&gt;8:05&lt;/strong&gt; - At the F1
station. Matt is there, awake, looking not too much worse for ware. Ryan
comes in right behind me. I have to get a parking permit, which &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHESS&lt;/span&gt;
kindly provides for visiting researchers. Since my car isn&amp;#8217;t registered
on campus, I qualify as a visiting researcher. &lt;strong&gt;8:10&lt;/strong&gt; - Matt briefs us
on the progress of the night. Some good data was taken, and we&amp;#8217;ve
switched from the helium to a liquid nitrogen (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LN&lt;/span&gt;) cooling. He lays out
the set of experiments we should try to run today. Obvious that he needs
sleep. &lt;strong&gt;8:45&lt;/strong&gt;- Matt goes home. Ryan and myself are on our own. Start a
data run. &lt;strong&gt;9-10&lt;/strong&gt; - All the staff are checking in on us. After the
problems of yesterday, they want to make sure everything is running
smoothly. Which it is. &lt;strong&gt;10:30&lt;/strong&gt; - Data running smoothly. When
everything goes well, for this particularly type of data set, there&amp;#8217;s
not much to be done while it&amp;#8217;s coming in. Put on the Greece vs. Nigeria
world cup game, streaming on my laptop. &lt;strong&gt;11:30&lt;/strong&gt; - Data run finished.
Load up a new crystal smooth as can be. Start another data set.
Everything working like a charm. &lt;strong&gt;12:30pm&lt;/strong&gt; - Lunch break. Much more
relaxed today. &lt;strong&gt;2:00&lt;/strong&gt; - Data run done. Switching to a different type
of data run &lt;strong&gt;2:15&lt;/strong&gt; - New run starts. Smooth sailing so far. &lt;strong&gt;2:30&lt;/strong&gt; -
Put on Mexico vs. France world cup game. &lt;strong&gt;3:30&lt;/strong&gt; - Attempting to start
a new run. Took us three or four tries to find a new crystal that was
good. Run good to go. &lt;strong&gt;4:15&lt;/strong&gt; - We&amp;#8217;re trying to run at 80K, but we&amp;#8217;re
having problems with temperature stability. We talk to Ulrich, and he
thinks that we&amp;#8217;ve got a partial ice plug in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LN&lt;/span&gt; line, reducing the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LN&lt;/span&gt;
we can draw through. We can either waste two hours having it replaced,
or run with it as it is. No guarantee that it won&amp;#8217;t get worse. We decide
to run with it, we&amp;#8217;ve lost too much beam time already. Our lowest
temperature seems to be \~90K. &lt;strong&gt;5:15&lt;/strong&gt; - Data run finishes. New crystal
mounted. New data run started. &lt;strong&gt;6:30&lt;/strong&gt;- Data run finishes. Two attempts
before we get a good crystal. Data flowing smoothly. &lt;strong&gt;7:10&lt;/strong&gt; - Matt
returns. There is much rejoicing. &lt;strong&gt;8:00&lt;/strong&gt;- Trying room temperature data
taking. Matt wants us to learn all the tricks this run, it seems. Having
trouble getting good crystals. &lt;strong&gt;10:00&lt;/strong&gt;- Room temperature data giving
us a few interesting results. Trying a full run, but we&amp;#8217;re going to kill
the crystal long before that. X rays will kill proteins (that&amp;#8217;s why we
avoid them, ourselves). Faster at room temperature than at 100K.
&lt;strong&gt;10:45&lt;/strong&gt; - Dinner from the stuff I packed this morning. I do love
microwaved leftovers. No rush, though. All three of us are in the lab,
and Ryan and Matt can handle whatever comes. &lt;strong&gt;11:25&lt;/strong&gt; - Lots of trouble
getting good crystals (4 or 5 attempts?). 220K is a hard temperature.
Finally gave up and went to 240K. &lt;strong&gt;11:55&lt;/strong&gt; - Ryan goes home. He&amp;#8217;ll be
back around 6 tomorrow. I&amp;#8217;m sticking it out for a while. Interesting
data coming in around 240K. If we&amp;#8217;re skilled and lucky, we&amp;#8217;ll get
something around 220K also. Friday 6/18 &lt;strong&gt;12:20am&lt;/strong&gt; - Potentially
exciting results! &lt;strong&gt;12:45&lt;/strong&gt; - Reproducible potentially exciting results!
&lt;strong&gt;1:15&lt;/strong&gt; - My brain can&amp;#8217;t do simple calculations right now, but we&amp;#8217;re
changing temperatures and trying out another look for our result at
240K. I hope it&amp;#8217;s there! &lt;strong&gt;1:20&lt;/strong&gt; - Morale lower. Possibly the effect is
from a perfectly reasonable explainable thing. What a great hour though!
&lt;strong&gt;1:45&lt;/strong&gt; - Data inconclusive but leaning towards no. Heading home. Leave
Matt all by his lonesome. &lt;strong&gt;1:55&lt;/strong&gt; - Home. Sleep time. Alarm set for&amp;nbsp;9.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jesse</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jun 2010 01:57:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2010-06-18:posts/life-as-an-experimenter-day-two.html</guid><category>long</category><category>CHESS</category><category>experiment</category></item><item><title>Life as an Experimenter - Day One</title><link>http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/life-as-an-experimenter-day-one.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m an experimental physicist. If you think this sounds like a job
second in glamour only to rock star you would be right. Just like being
a rock star, you have to deal with the people, the shows, the lights,
the groupies &amp;#8230; okay, maybe I&amp;#8217;m lying about the groupies. Unless
you&amp;#8217;re &lt;a href="http://groups.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=groups.groupprofile&amp;amp;groupID=103575126"&gt;Brian
Greene&lt;/a&gt;.
Also similar to a rock star, no one really knows what it is we do behind
the scenes (when we&amp;#8217;re not touring the nation or publishing papers). I&amp;#8217;d
like to pull back that curtain a little bit. A bit of background. For
this data run we&amp;#8217;re looking at the structure of protein crystals. The
basic idea is that if you have a bunch of proteins, you can create a
crystal out of them using various synthesis techniques. If they&amp;#8217;re
formed right, they look similar to the crystals you are more familiar
with, quartz, diamond, emerald, etc. We&amp;#8217;re interested in how the
proteins are held in the crystal, that is, what kind of structure the
protein crystal has. I&amp;#8217;ll talk more about this at some other point. Our
method for examining this is using x rays. Similar to a medical x-ray,
we shoot x-rays at our sample, and look at the transmitted images. Of
course, instead of something like this:
&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_SYZpxZOlcb0/TBpWZFChfhI/AAAAAAAAABs/Cp-4Rf5ca5Y/s1600/X-ray-hands.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_SYZpxZOlcb0/TBpWZFChfhI/AAAAAAAAABs/Cp-4Rf5ca5Y/s320/X-ray-hands.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
we see something like this:
&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_SYZpxZOlcb0/TBpWqG2OqLI/AAAAAAAAAB0/SncRJvsz1Uk/s1600/20071104200851!X-ray_diffraction_pattern_3clpro.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_SYZpxZOlcb0/TBpWqG2OqLI/AAAAAAAAAB0/SncRJvsz1Uk/s320/20071104200851!X-ray_diffraction_pattern_3clpro.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
which is a little bit harder to interpret. Nevertheless, we&amp;#8217;ve got some
pretty nifty software that will do the job for us. The unfortunate part
about using x-rays is that to produce research grade x-rays takes really
big expensive facilities, so we have a limited amount of time we get to
use them for. Right now, we&amp;#8217;ve got 48 hours of beam time, so we want to
take data for as many of those 48 hours as possible. For those
interested, we&amp;#8217;re using &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHESS&lt;/span&gt; at Cornell, station F1. Wednesday, 6/16
&lt;strong&gt;9:30am&lt;/strong&gt;- Get up. I was warned by the postdoc in my group to sleep in
as much as I could. Our data run starts at noon, and goes for 48 hours.
Who knows how much sleep we&amp;#8217;ll get in those 48 hours. Our beam time
starts at noon today. I eat breakfast, and realize that I&amp;#8217;ve left my lab
notebook in the lab. I need to swing by there and pick it up. &lt;strong&gt;10:52&lt;/strong&gt;
- Out of the house. My goal is to be at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHESS&lt;/span&gt; by 11. As this is my first
time using the facility, I need to get a safety tour before I can use
the beam line. I hope on my bike and speed towards to the physics
building. &lt;strong&gt;10:54&lt;/strong&gt; - Downpour. I get soaked. I&amp;#8217;m wearing a rain jacket,
but my jeans and shoes are soaked through. &lt;strong&gt;10:55&lt;/strong&gt;- A pocket on my
backpack comes unzipped, dumping my water bottle (and, as I find out
later, my bike lock) into the road. I stop and retrieve the water
bottle. &lt;strong&gt;11:02&lt;/strong&gt; - Arrive at physics building. Hasten to the lab,
dripping water. Grab notebook. Receive call from Ryan, another graduate
student in the lab, saying he&amp;#8217;s at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHESS&lt;/span&gt;, and ready to take the safety
tour when I am. &lt;strong&gt;11:12&lt;/strong&gt; - Arrive at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHESS&lt;/span&gt;. Realize I don&amp;#8217;t have my
bike lock anymore. Call Ryan and tell him to take the tour without me,
I&amp;#8217;ll get to it later. Hop on bike, ride route in reverse. Find lock
right where water bottle fell out. &lt;strong&gt;11:25&lt;/strong&gt; - Back at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHESS&lt;/span&gt;. Check in.
Get given safety tour, radiation badge. Meet up with Ryan. Good times.
&lt;strong&gt;11:59&lt;/strong&gt; - Matt, the postdoc in my lab, with experience at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHESS&lt;/span&gt; and
the samples and equipment, arrives. &lt;strong&gt;12:00pm&lt;/strong&gt; - Beam time starts.
We&amp;#8217;re not ready. For this run, we&amp;#8217;re using liquid helium to cool our
sample. We have to get that set up first. &lt;strong&gt;1:45&lt;/strong&gt; - With the aid of
Ulrich, one of the Research Associates at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHESS&lt;/span&gt;, we have the liquid
helium stream set up to cool our sample. &lt;strong&gt;2:00&lt;/strong&gt;- Matt trains Ryan and
myself how to mount samples for the beam. &lt;strong&gt;2:15&lt;/strong&gt; - Matt mounts a
sample, and trains Ryan and myself how to operate beam controls.
&lt;strong&gt;2:30&lt;/strong&gt;- Start taking data. &lt;strong&gt;2:45&lt;/strong&gt;- Crystal turns out to be not very
crystalline. Rinse and repeat. &lt;strong&gt;4:00&lt;/strong&gt; - After 7 increasingly
frustrating attempts with bad crystals, the 8th turns out to give us a
good signal. Looks like we&amp;#8217;re back in business. &lt;strong&gt;4:15&lt;/strong&gt; - Getting
anomalous signals from our sample. Every 5th image has about have the
intensity of the others. Also getting some weird tiling in the image. No
one knows what&amp;#8217;s going on. We call in Ulrich and the beam operator.
&lt;strong&gt;4:30&lt;/strong&gt;- In the midst of trying to resolve the anomalous signals, the
computer we&amp;#8217;re running the experimental control software on goes down.
Requires calling in more tech support. &lt;strong&gt;4:50&lt;/strong&gt;- I take a break to eat.
First food since breakfast. Two sandwiches and a half-frozen banana
(kept it near the back of the fridge in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHESS&lt;/span&gt; lounge. I learned my
lesson). &lt;strong&gt;5:10&lt;/strong&gt; - Food eaten. Computer back up. Data taking ready.
Still no resolution for the anomalous signal. While the experts continue
to trouble shoot, Matt attempts to figure out if we can run any of our
experiments with the data as bad as it currently is. &lt;strong&gt;5:45&lt;/strong&gt; - Still no
solution. Matt has determined that none of our planned experiments will
work with the data as bad as it is. Suspicion of a bad detector (a
million dollar piece of equipment). Morale is low. &lt;strong&gt;8:00&lt;/strong&gt; - After
continued trouble shooting, Ulrich is convinced that the problem is a
bad shutter for the x ray beam (just like a camera, you achieve a
certain image exposure by letting the beam hit the sample/detector for a
certain amount of time). &lt;strong&gt;8:30&lt;/strong&gt; - Technician arrives to swap shutters.
Operation successful! Data looks good. &lt;strong&gt;9:00&lt;/strong&gt; - After some test runs,
we start taking real data. Morale is high. &lt;strong&gt;11:15&lt;/strong&gt; - Data coming in
with no sign of stopping. Ryan and I head home. Matt has the night
shift, we&amp;#8217;re to relieve him at 8 the next morning. &lt;strong&gt;11:20&lt;/strong&gt;- Discover
that my bike has somehow broken while sitting on the bike rack. The
collar that keeps the handlebars in the frame is loose, and the
handlebars no longer connect with the front wheel. Bike is unrideable.
&lt;strong&gt;11:25&lt;/strong&gt; - Decide bike is unfixable with current tools. I have to walk
it home. &lt;strong&gt;11:40&lt;/strong&gt; - Home. Attempt to fix bike. Discover none of my
wrenches are quite large enough. &lt;strong&gt;11:45&lt;/strong&gt;- Food. Microwave leftovers.
Discover one of my housemates has left fresh chocolate chip cookies on
the counter for the rest of the house. Bless her a thousand times over
and eat two. &lt;strong&gt;** Thursday 6/17 &lt;/strong&gt;12:15am** - Set alarm for 7:15am, and
hop into&amp;nbsp;bed.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jesse</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jun 2010 13:53:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2010-06-17:posts/life-as-an-experimenter-day-one.html</guid><category>CHESS</category><category>long day</category><category>experiment</category></item><item><title>Letting Air Out of Tires II</title><link>http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/letting-air-out-of-tires-ii.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/05/letting-air-out-of-tires.html"&gt;recent
post&lt;/a&gt;
I calculated how cold air coming out of bike tires should feel. However,
at the end of the post, I did note that there are competing explanations
for why the air cools. There&amp;#8217;s the approach I took, which is adiabatic
cooling, but there&amp;#8217;s also something called the Joule-Thomson effect. The
Joule-Thomson effect has the interesting property that helium being let
out of a bike tire would actually be warmer, which suggests an immediate
way to test which effect is dominant. We pressurize a bike tire with
helium, and see if the valve gets cold or hot. This is exactly what I
did. With the help of Mark and Vince, our local equipment gurus, I was
able to pressurize a bike tire to 26 psi with helium. Using one of those
little thermal measurers you can buy at radio shack, we measured the
initial temperature of the valve as 80 F. We then released the helium,
and measured the temperature of the valve as 73 F. The adiabatic
approach is the winner! Our experiment confirms that the dominant effect
of the cooling is the adiabatic cooling I talked about yesterday. The
Joule-Thomson effect may be at play, but if so it takes a secondary role
to the adiabatic cooling. Now, some of you may be saying: wait a second,
you predicted the air would be -100 F! It doesn&amp;#8217;t feel that cold! Nor
did your valve cool down to -100 F! To which I reply: Yes, I did predict
very cold air. But you have to remember that it is mixing with a lot of
room temperature air, so it won&amp;#8217;t feel as cold as I predicted. Nor will
it transfer much heat to the valve (recall, we predicted this would be
an adiabatic process, with absolutely no heat transfer, something that
is obviously false). Also, I didn&amp;#8217;t have 60 psi of pressure. If we do
the calculation, 26 psi only gives a temperature of 250K = - 10 F.
Hopefully that answers your question. And now, dear reader, as I&amp;#8217;ve
wanted to say for a while: Myth&amp;nbsp;Busted!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jesse</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 04 May 2010 14:52:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2010-05-04:posts/letting-air-out-of-tires-ii.html</guid><category>bike</category><category>tire</category><category>thermodynamics</category><category>gas</category><category>cold</category><category>experiment</category><category>busted</category></item><item><title>Letting Air Out of Tires</title><link>http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/letting-air-out-of-tires.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever noticed how when you let air out of a bike tire (or, I
suppose, a car tire) it feels rather cold? Today we&amp;#8217;re going to explore
why that is, and just how cold it is. Many people consider the air
escaping from a tire as a classic example of an adiabatic process. What
is an adiabatic process? It is a process that happens so quickly there
is no time for heat flow to occur. For our air in the bike tire this
means we&amp;#8217;re letting it out of the tire so quickly that no energy can
move into it from the surrounding air. This may not be exactly true,
there may be a little energy flow, but there is little enough that we
can ignore it. Given that, how do we talk about temperature change?
Let&amp;#8217;s give a physical motivation first. Imagine a gas as a collection of
hard spheres, like baseballs. Envision this bunch of baseballs in a box.
Suppose you make the volume of the box smaller, you move the walls in.
The baseballs will start to bounce around faster. Having trouble
thinking of this? Think of a single baseball in a box. Imagine it hits a
wall moving towards it. What happens? That&amp;#8217;s just like what happens when
a baseball hits a baseball bat moving towards it, it goes flying. That
is, it starts moving faster. The speed with which these gas particles
are moving is what we measure as temperature. So shrinking our box
increases the temperature. Likewise, expanding our box will decrease the
temperature. The same principle holds here. Our gas is expanding from a
small volume (the bike tire) into a larger volume (the surrounding
world). Thus we expect the temperature to decrease.
Got all that? Good. Now for some math. It turns out that using the ideal
gas law, we can derive that for an (reversible) adiabatic process
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$PV^\gamma=constant$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
where P is the pressure of the gas, V is the volume of the gas, and
gamma is (for our purposes) just a number. The ideal gas law states that
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$PV=NkT$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
Where N is the number of gas molecules we have, T is the temperature of
the gas, and k is a constant. Since N doesn&amp;#8217;t change in the process
we&amp;#8217;re considering, we can use this to rewrite the above equation, by
substituting for V. This gives
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$P^{1-\gamma}T^{\gamma}=constant$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
Where the constant is not the same as above.
Because this is equal to a constant, we can say that our initial
pressure and temperature are related to our final pressure and
temperature by
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$P_i^{1-\gamma}T_i^{\gamma}=P_f^{1-\gamma}T_f^{\gamma}$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
We can solve this for the final temperature giving
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$T_f=T_i\left(\frac{P_i}{P_f}\right)^{\tfrac{1-\gamma}{\gamma}}$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
Finally, we can plug in some numbers. Gamma is 7/5 for diatomic gases
(which is most of air). If we assume the air is about room temperature,
20 C, and the tire is at 60 psi, this gives (1 atmosphere of pressure is
15 psi):
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$T_f=293K\left(\frac{60 psi}{15
psi}\right)^{\tfrac{1-7/5}{7/5}}=197K$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
Converting back from Kelvin to C, this is -76 C or -105 F. That&amp;#8217;s cold!
&lt;strong&gt;For the Expert:&lt;/strong&gt;
There is actually a debate as to whether or not adiabatic cooling is
responsible for the chill of air upon being let out of a tire. The
argument for it is fairly straightforward. The released air does work on
the surrounding atmosphere as it leaves, lowering the energy of the gas.
If this is the primary effect, then the change in temperature is given
above. However, it is possible that we can consider this a free
adiabatic expansion. In a free adiabatic expansion (like a gas expanding
into a vacuum), there is no work done, because gas is not acting
&amp;#8216;against&amp;#8217; anything.
The other possibility is the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule%E2%80%93Thomson_effect"&gt;Joule-Thomson
effect&lt;/a&gt;. I
don&amp;#8217;t claim to understand this effect very thoroughly, but it is another
mechanism for cooling when air is let out of a well insulated valve.
I&amp;#8217;ve seen claims both ways as to which process is actually responsible
for cooling.
Fortunately, a simple experiment suggests itself. Helium heats up
through the Joule-Thomson effect (when it starts abot \~50K). It will
cool down through the above described adiabatic cooling. So, fill a bike
tire with Helium gas, and let it out. See if the valve/gas feels hot or
cold. This will determine the dominant effect. As an experimentalist,
this &lt;a href="http://www.brightlywound.com/?comic=42"&gt;appeals greatly to me&lt;/a&gt;.
But if any theorists out there have ideas, please speak&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jesse</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 03 May 2010 23:21:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2010-05-03:posts/letting-air-out-of-tires.html</guid><category>bike</category><category>tire</category><category>thermodynamics</category><category>gas</category><category>cold</category><category>experiment</category></item></channel></rss>
