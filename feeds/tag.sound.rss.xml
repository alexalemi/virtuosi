In my analysis I came to the conclusion that the momentum delivered was much less than that of a conventional gun, but that the impulse, and hence the force delivered, was about the same.  However, that force was delivered over a ~30ns timescale, which left open the question of whether or not the wielder would be able to feel that&amp;nbsp;recoil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I had thought to possibly return to this issue at some point, Matt has beat me to it.  This is fortuitous, because I wasn&amp;#8217;t sure quite where to start with the question, while he approaches it in a very sensible, clear manner.  The gist of his post is that he compares our response to short time scale forces to our ability to sense sound.  I won&amp;#8217;t go through his calculations, you can check those out for yourself, but he concludes that it is very unlikely that we could feel the recoil of our laser&amp;nbsp;gun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case closed.  Though, like any good scientist, we may choose to reopen it later if more evidence comes to&amp;nbsp;light.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jesse</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 21 Apr 2010 16:31:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2010-04-21:posts/laser-gun-recoil-follow-up.html</guid><category>recoil</category><category>laser</category><category>sound</category><category>momentum</category><category>gun</category></item></channel></rss>
