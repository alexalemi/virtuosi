This is my first post on The Virtuosi, so I thought I’d take a moment to
introduce myself. I’m a first year physics graduate student at Cornell,
recently joined after 2 years working as an engineer first at a private
firm and then at a national lab. I myself have had lots of fun following
the exploits of my estimable colleagues here on The Virtuosi, and I
thought I could bring a new angle to the content here. I would like to
use this space to discuss how science interacts with everyday life in a
cultural sense. How does science appear in popular culture? How do
political or social issues relate back to science? Those sorts of
questions. (I understand that there are plenty of other resources
elsewhere that offer far more intelligent insight into these matters
than I can, but in the very least this will give people a chance point
them out to me as they yell at me in the forum below.)
Enough intro, here begins my very first blog post:
Being interested in how science is communicated to the public, I am an
avid reader of popular science. While academic types sometimes dismiss
this kind of writing as shallow or otherwise uninteresting, I think
science writers perform a very important function serving as a way to
convey information about conceptually challenging topics to a general
audience. At their best, I find that these books serve as examples for
how I can communicate my own ideas better, and in addition challenge my
understanding of how science relates back to society in general.
This being said, I cannot recommend Charles Seife’s &lt;em&gt;Proofiness&lt;/em&gt; enough.
The basic premise of this book is to explore the way that good
mathematics is hijacked, twisted, or ignored in everyday life, and the
ugly consequences of the tendency to misunderstand numbers and
measurements.
Seife gives a number of fascinating examples of the ways in which
numbers and math connect to American democracy. American government
functions through representation, and so the
“&lt;a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html"&gt;enumeration&lt;/a&gt;”
of citizens and their opinions through the Census and elections is an
essential part of the democratic process. This “enumeration” is a
counting measurement, subject to errors like any other. And yet, the
laws that govern how Censuses and elections are run ignore this fact.
Seife’s discussion of elections (and in particular &lt;em&gt;Bush v. Gore&lt;/em&gt;) is
fascinating, but I won’t spoil that here. Here’s my take on the
discussion of the Census that appears in &lt;em&gt;Proofiness&lt;/em&gt;:
Consider a (vague) physics experiment. I want to know how many particles
are inside a box. To figure this out, I have a detector that goes
&lt;em&gt;ping&lt;/em&gt; every time a particle passes through it. I set up my detector
inside the box and count the number of times that it goes &lt;em&gt;ping&lt;/em&gt; in a
certain amount of time. I can then use that count to guess at the number
of particles that I have in my box. My measurement will let me estimate
N to within some margin of error. This process is perhaps unnecessary if
I have only five particles in my box (in which case, I might just open
the box and count what I see inside), but if I have 300 million
particles in my box, it would be totally impractical for me to reach
into the box 300 million times and count each one individually.
We can consider the Census to be just like this physics experiment. I
have N inhabitants (particles) living in my country (box), and I can use
my detector (census replies) to count a certain number of people. In
principle, using well-understood statistical techniques of regression
and error analysis, I can estimate to within a very good margin of error
how many people live in each region of the country. Instead, what the
Census requires is that we reach inside the box (send representatives to
every household that doesn’t reply by mail) and count every single
person. The whole process ignores the fact that even if we send a
representative to every single household there will still be some margin
of error in our counting measurements. No such measurement can be made
without errors.
The consequences of ignoring these errors, says Seife, can be that we
waste money in attempting the impossible and trying to count everybody.
From a civic-minded perspective, this attitude towards the perfection of
the Census can backfire. For example, if undercounting occurs (i.e.,
certain households do not respond for some reason), the Census has no
mechanism for correcting that miscount. Counter-intuitively, the Census
laws actually prohibit the use of any statistical techniques to correct
miscounting. The result is that those slow to respond are ignored and
not taken into account when allotting seats in the legislature to
represent them.
&lt;em&gt;Proofiness&lt;/em&gt; is a fascinating book and a fun read, and I recommend you
all look it up. In addition, it serves as an excellent example of
science writing that helped me to rethink how scientific ideas relate to
everyday life. I hope to invite consideration of these topics here and
in future posts. If you want to know more about the inspiration for this

Somehow I&amp;#8217;ve managed to read three books in the last two days, and each of them were excellent enough that I need to tell people about them.
&lt;h3&gt;Street Fighting Mathematics - Sanjoy&amp;nbsp;Mahajan &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The art of educated guessing and opportunistic problem&amp;nbsp;solving &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=12156"&gt;Link to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MIT&lt;/span&gt; Press&amp;nbsp;Site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know that feeling you get when it&amp;#8217;s the second half of January and you put on new clothes that have just come out of the dryer?  This book is like a cross between that and a kick in the&amp;nbsp;face.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The warm fuzzy-clothes-out-of-the-dryer feeling will come from the realization that you can wield unsurmountable power.  The kick in the face will come when you realize you&amp;#8217;re not doing it yet.
&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
The premise of the book is something along the lines of:  We&amp;#8217;ve all been taught how to solve math problem exactly.  Science isn&amp;#8217;t exact.  Turns out when you realize this, you can do a heck of a lot.  Let Sanjoy show you&amp;nbsp;how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an undergrad, I had the supreme fortune of taking some life changing courses.  One of the ones that has struck me the deepest was Ph 101: Order of Magnitude Physics.  It did a remarkable job building my confidence.  It&amp;#8217;s one thing to go through your classes and complete the homework assignments.  It&amp;#8217;s another thing entirely to feel as you can take a stab at just about any question anyone can&amp;nbsp;ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is the handbook that will introduce you to the techniques and ways of thinking you&amp;#8217;ll need in order to tackle the most general of questions.  The first chapter is Dimensional Analysis, something that every high school student should be exposed to. I love Dimensional Analysis.  The rest of the book goes on to estimate Integrals, Sums and Differential Equations, thinking about limiting cases and scaling, and thinking&amp;nbsp;pictorially.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part:  it&amp;#8217;s available in a creative commons version, i.e. for free.  Just follow the creative common pdf link in the left&amp;nbsp;sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest flaws I see in modern physics teaching is that physics courses have a tendency of being reduced to plugging numbers into highlighted and yellow boxed equations.  That&amp;#8217;s not physics!  Physics is a way of thinking about the world.  It&amp;#8217;s the delight you obtain when you understand something for the first time.  It&amp;#8217;s the power you can wield by being able to properly predict phenomenon that only minutes ago you found baffling.  In a word: it&amp;#8217;s awesome.  In order to be able to see past all of the equations, you need to have an appreciation for how powerful intelligent approximations can&amp;nbsp;be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amazing fact is that with a proper introductory physics course, you are capable of understanding a huge deal of the world around&amp;nbsp;you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If physics classes were taught the way Sanjoy would like them to be taught, if they relied fundamentally on the kinds of techniques he discusses, I think students would like physics a lot more.  I think the world would be a better place.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why Things Break  - Mark E.&amp;nbsp;Eberhart &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Understanding the world by the way it comes&amp;nbsp;apart &lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TLkXVqJBxlI/AAAAAAAAAOs/WEGJaROjFhI/s1600/4115MFY61ML._SS500_.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TLkXVqJBxlI/AAAAAAAAAOs/WEGJaROjFhI/s320/4115MFY61ML._SS500_.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=wo9wGKk9MVsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Why+Things+Break&amp;hl=eo&amp;ei=4Be5TJ6jPIL48Aa2uKzPDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"&gt;Link to Google Books&amp;nbsp;Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book was mentioned to me by someone in my group.  I decided to check it out, and read the first 70% of it in one sitting.  I think that says something about&amp;nbsp;it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a really fun read.  It&amp;#8217;s a popular science book, but on something you&amp;#8217;ve probably never read about before - material&amp;nbsp;science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mixing very interesting history, science, and biography, Eberhart takes you on a journey attempting to answer the question: Why do things break?  Which he is quick to point out is probably not the question you think it is.  His life goal is not to answer what happens when things break, or which materials break sooner than others (which he manages to mention along the way anyway), but he is primarily interested in answergin why things even break in the first place, a rather subtle and non-trivial question when you think about&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually learned quite a lot from this book.  It&amp;#8217;s full of really interesting accounts and digressions.  I can&amp;#8217;t recommend it enough.  Very fun&amp;nbsp;read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Soap Bubbles - C. V.&amp;nbsp;Boys &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Their colours and the forces which mold&amp;nbsp;them &lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=EcgCKTPYqCIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"&gt;Link to Google Books&amp;nbsp;page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this book by accident, but boy am I glad I found it.  It&amp;#8217;s a printing of a series of lectures the author gave to some children near the close of the 19th century about&amp;nbsp;bubbles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This goes into the drawer of happy little discoveries I&amp;#8217;ve made of old science literature for which the copyright has expired.  Meaning its free on Google Books as a pdf&amp;nbsp;download.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know what it is, but I find basically anything written before about 1950 at least an order of magnitude easier to understand than anything since.  Sure, some of it has to do with the fact that older science literature is necessarily dated, while new physics can tend to be a lot more complicated, and you could point out that there is a clear selection bias in the old texts that I manage to find, but I really believe there is something more to it than that.  Old science authors wrote to be understood.  You get the distinct impression that most of these guys really loved their craft and really wanted to explain their findings to others.  Sometimes I get the impression that modern articles are written less to be understood and more as the modern version of mailing your patent idea to yourself in a closed envelope - as a way to get a stamp on your lab notebook to prove you did something&amp;nbsp;first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, this little gem was not what I thought it was going to be.  Going in, I thought it would be a bunch of cool things you could do with bubbles.  Oh but it&amp;#8217;s so much more.  Boys manages in these three little lectures to give one of the clearest introductions to some basic fluid dynamics and electricity I&amp;#8217;ve seen.  Boys manages to teach, and while using&amp;nbsp;bubbles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend it.  If not for the science and cool bubble tricks, I think it can serve as another find indicating that physics education doesn&amp;#8217;t need to be boring in order to get real ideas&amp;nbsp;planted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Calculus Made Easy - Silvanus Phillips&amp;nbsp;Thompson &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Being a very-simplest introduction to those beautiful methods of reckoning which are generally called by the terrifying names of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DIFFERENTIAL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CALCULUS&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;INTEGRAL&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CALCULUS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BrhBAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Calculus+Made+Easy&amp;hl=eo&amp;ei=WRu5TKDJLsT38Ab4wNiaDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"&gt;Google Books Link&lt;/a&gt; - another&amp;nbsp;freebie&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to admit, I didn&amp;#8217;t just read this one.  I read it a while ago, but while writing up the other ones I could let such a fantastical book as this pass by without&amp;nbsp;mention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another book I found by accident for free on Google Books.  If I remember correctly, this one was pure serendipity.  But it has to be the best introductory calculus book ever written.  Seriously.  I don&amp;#8217;t joke about these things.  I fell in love with it as soon as I finished reading the subtitle (and the author&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;name).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This. book. rocks.  If nothing else, do yourself a favor and read the first couple chapters of this bad boy.  It&amp;#8217;s free.  I won&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s so good, I read it online.  Then I checked it out from the library.  Then I bought the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Calculus-Made-Easy-CALCULUS-MADE/dp/B001TIKS36/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1287200177&amp;sr=8-4"&gt;shiny new edition&lt;/a&gt; because I needed to have it on my shelf.  Turns out I&amp;#8217;m not the only one in love with the book.  Martin Gardner so loved it as to release the shiny edition with recreational problems and his&amp;nbsp;commentary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not Calculus crib notes.  This is not spark notes or Calculus for Dummies.  This is not just a condensed version of the calculus book you used in highschool.  This isn&amp;#8217;t just a list of formulas.  This book &lt;i&gt;explains&lt;/i&gt; what calculus is.  You do not understand what I meant by the sentence.  You will not understand until you read Calculus Made&amp;nbsp;Easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another book that just makes me sad at the current state of education.  Calculus is one of those things that&amp;#8217;s feared by the general public.  It&amp;#8217;s feared because it&amp;#8217;s misunderstood.  Calculus isn&amp;#8217;t hard.  And I don&amp;#8217;t mean to just sound like a jerk when I say that.  It isn&amp;#8217;t meant to be hard at least.  As the opening proverb of Calculus Made Easy says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;What one fool can do, another can.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
All it really takes to understand calculus is the ability to imagine a very little bit of something.  That and a caring and skilled tutor to lead you on your way.  What name can you think of that sounds more caring and skillful than Silvanus Phillips&amp;nbsp;Thompson.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can think of no legitimate reason this book isn&amp;#8217;t used in each and every high school calculus in America.&amp;nbsp;Seriously.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Alemi</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 16 Oct 2010 00:50:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2010-10-16:posts/four-fantastic-books-3-of-which-are-free-.html</guid><category>book review</category><category>fun</category><category>math</category><category>bad physics</category></item></channel></rss>
