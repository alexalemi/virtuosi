I started during my sophomore year in college, went straight to graduate school, and continued here (albeit not quite immediately).  There are people out there who have been doing this for a lot longer than I have, but I&amp;#8217;ve gained a few insights, by working with said people, and through my own experiences in the lab.  I thought I&amp;#8217;d try to share a few of these, to help illuminate the past few days I blogged&amp;nbsp;about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;Something Always Goes Wrong&lt;/b&gt;
It&amp;#8217;s the nature of experimental science.  Something always goes wrong.  It might be your equipment, it might be your sample, hell, it might be something personal.  But something will go wrong.  Wednesday was a prime example.  Not only did I get soaked by rain and temporarily lose my bike lock, but it took us 9 hours to really start taking data due to equipment problems.  I think this is endemic in what we&amp;#8217;re doing.  We&amp;#8217;re trying to investigate something that no one has ever done (at least not quite exactly what we&amp;#8217;re doing).  This means that we&amp;#8217;re usually pushing the bounds of our equipment and setup.  Not just that, but most of the equipment is exceedingly complex, giving it many more places it can break&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It&amp;#8217;s An Emotional Roller Coaster&lt;/b&gt;
Sometimes nothing works.  At all.  You try and try and you just can&amp;#8217;t make it work.  Then sometimes everything is going well.  You&amp;#8217;re getting data, and not just that, but the data looks good.  Whether it&amp;#8217;s confirming or destroying your expectations, you&amp;#8217;re finding out something new about the world.  It&amp;#8217;s exciting.  You find something interesting and start chasing it.  However, you have to be careful.  Often the result is not what you think you&amp;#8217;re seeing.  It&amp;#8217;s a false signal from your equipment, or attributable to the background material doing something strange.  Or you&amp;#8217;ve destroyed the sample, and that&amp;#8217;s why it&amp;#8217;s  not doing what you expect.  You go up and down quite a&amp;nbsp;bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It&amp;#8217;s Exhausting&lt;/b&gt;
Part of it is the long hours.  But really, 16 hour days are not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; bad.  Sleeping 6.5-7 hours.  I can usually do that, no problem.  So what&amp;#8217;s different when it&amp;#8217;s research?  You have to be thinking all the time.  For 16 hours.  In general, you can&amp;#8217;t just push the button and wait.  You need to look at the data while it comes in, to determine what data to take next.  Combine that with the emotional up and down &amp;#8230; even though you&amp;#8217;re not necessarily physically exhausted, you&amp;#8217;re mentally worn&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You Get More Questions Than Answers&lt;/b&gt;
My undergraduate advisor would always say that when you&amp;#8217;re doing research you generate three questions for every question you answer.  That&amp;#8217;s more or less true.  It is very rare to go out and answer all the questions you have.  It is even more rare to not get more questions.    There&amp;#8217;s always more to learn.  In many ways, that&amp;#8217;s great, though a little frustrating.  If we ran out of questions, we&amp;#8217;d probably run out of a job.  But there&amp;#8217;s always another twist that you didn&amp;#8217;t expect nature to have, something else surprising you.  That&amp;#8217;s why we do it.  There&amp;#8217;s no finality in research.  We can&amp;#8217;t get all the answers,&amp;nbsp;ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of our time isn&amp;#8217;t data taking, but making/setting up our equipment, analyzing data, and such things.  Still, I hope that this series of posts has given you a taste of what we scientists may do when we&amp;#8217;re taking&amp;nbsp;data.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jesse</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jun 2010 15:50:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2010-06-19:posts/life-as-an-experimenter-reflections.html</guid><category>reflection</category><category>CHESS</category><category>experiment</category></item><item><title>Life as an Experimenter - Day Three</title><link>http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/life-as-an-experimenter-day-three.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;Today marks the third and final day in our beam time at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHESS&lt;/span&gt;.  I think the circles under all of our eyes may take away from the glamor a bit, but the right makeup specialist could fix that.  If they ever make a movie about us, which they should, I want to be played by some really awesome british actor.  I think that would be about right.  Someone with a strong jaw.  In case it&amp;#8217;s not obvious, lack of sleep is getting to me a little bit.  Read on for the final few hours of our experiment.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;Friday 6/18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;9:07am&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt; - Not sure if I didn&amp;#8217;t turn on my alarm, or turned it off without noticing.  But somehow I manage to jerk awake not too much later than planned.  Dragging a little bit.  Get some food.  No time for shower, do that in a few hours.  Only have to get through to noon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;9:41&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt; - Leave house.  Hop in car.  Realize as I drive through that there&amp;#8217;s a stop sign at a corner that I didn&amp;#8217;t see last night, mostly hidden by trees.  Very glad there wasn&amp;#8217;t any traffic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;9:54&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt; - Arrive back at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHESS&lt;/span&gt;.  Set up laptop to stream the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; game.  Get a report from Matt and Ryan.  Looks like the data that was exciting last night is actually repeatable, and though it is a small effect, probably real.  This is a very nice bonus for our experiment, we were mostly expecting null results from that phase of things.  Plan is to test that more, run some experiments to make sure we&amp;#8217;re not seeing other, more mundane, effects that would look the same with our collection methods.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;10:25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt; - I take over crystal mounting.  Matt is busy with data, and Ryan is not having luck with crystals this morning.  That&amp;#8217;s how it goes.  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; is down a goal.  Morale low for that reason.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;10:45&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt; - Data taking going okay.  Still seeing the effect, though small.  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; down 2 goals.  Not good at all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;11:00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt; - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; down 1 goal!  Oh yes.  Some experiment.  We&amp;#8217;re almost done, not paying too much attention any more.  Everyone is slowing down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;11:20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt; - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHESS&lt;/span&gt; staff members keep on wandering into our area and staying to watch the game.  Kind of fun.  One got us an ethernet cable to eliminate some of the pauses we were getting in the streaming  using the wireless.  Set up a final run, determine if the effect is from what we suspect (hope?) or from mundane causes.  Need to pack up and be out in 40 minutes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;11:45&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt; - Experiment finishes.  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; is robbed!  Should have been a victory.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;11:50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt; - Mad scramble to pack up equipment.  Crystals, mounts, computers, etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;11:58&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt; - Off the beam.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;12:05pm &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;- Parking permit returned.  On my way home.  Taking the rest of the day off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;I hope that you, dear reader, have enjoyed this brief taste of how experiments go.  I tried to let the emotions reflect what I actually was feeling at the time, but often for the most harrowing/exciting parts there was no time to write, so much of this has been upon reflection.  Tomorrow I hope to offer a few insights into how experiments usually seem to go.  A lot of people have never done experimental science, and experimentation in movies is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://xkcd.com/683/"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;very different&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt; from what we actually do.  Now it&amp;#8217;s time to sleep.  And maybe watch the England/Algeria game.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jesse</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jun 2010 13:49:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2010-06-18:posts/life-as-an-experimenter-day-three.html</guid><category>CHESS</category><category>experiment</category></item><item><title>Life as an Experimenter - Day Two</title><link>http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/life-as-an-experimenter-day-two.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Today I&amp;#8217;m continuing my series on the life of an experimenter.  Today is the longest day, since we have beam time for all 24 hours.  And after the setbacks of yesterday, we feel compelled to use it to the utmost bit.  Read on for more tantalizing glimpses of the grit behind the glamor of the rock-star-like lifestyle of an experimental&amp;nbsp;physicist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Today had a very different feel.  Things were working, and that meant a lot of down time waiting for data to collect.  Despite the excitement of data coming in, I was a little bored at points.  Lots of internet&amp;nbsp;use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thursday 6/17
&lt;b&gt;7:15am&lt;/b&gt; - Alarm goes off.  6.5 hours of sleep?  Up quickly, and eat and shower.  Run into a couple of my housemates that I normally don&amp;#8217;t.  I don&amp;#8217;t feel to tired.  Which is good, because I don&amp;#8217;t usually do caffeine, if I had to now, it might well mess me&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7:50&lt;/b&gt; - Out of the house.  Taking my car, since my bike isn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8:05&lt;/b&gt; - At the F1 station.  Matt is there, awake, looking not too much worse for ware.  Ryan comes in right behind me.  I have to get a parking permit, which &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHESS&lt;/span&gt; kindly provides for visiting researchers.  Since my car isn&amp;#8217;t registered on campus, I qualify as a visiting&amp;nbsp;researcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8:10&lt;/b&gt; - Matt briefs us on the progress of the night.  Some good data was taken, and we&amp;#8217;ve switched from the helium to a liquid nitrogen (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LN&lt;/span&gt;) cooling.  He lays out the set of experiments we should try to run today.  Obvious that he needs&amp;nbsp;sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8:45 &lt;/b&gt;- Matt goes home.  Ryan and myself are on our own.  Start a data&amp;nbsp;run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9-10&lt;/b&gt; - All the staff are checking in on us.  After the problems of yesterday, they want to make sure everything is running smoothly.  Which it&amp;nbsp;is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10:30&lt;/b&gt; - Data running smoothly.  When everything goes well, for this particularly type of data set, there&amp;#8217;s not much to be done while it&amp;#8217;s coming in.  Put on the Greece vs. Nigeria world cup game, streaming on my&amp;nbsp;laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;11:30&lt;/b&gt; - Data run finished.  Load up a new crystal smooth as can be.  Start another data set.  Everything working like a&amp;nbsp;charm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;12:30pm&lt;/b&gt; - Lunch break.  Much more relaxed&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2:00&lt;/b&gt; - Data run done.  Switching to a different type of data&amp;nbsp;run&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2:15&lt;/b&gt; - New run starts.  Smooth sailing so&amp;nbsp;far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2:30&lt;/b&gt; - Put on Mexico vs. France world cup&amp;nbsp;game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3:30&lt;/b&gt; - Attempting to start a new run.  Took us three or four tries to find a new crystal that was good.  Run good to&amp;nbsp;go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4:15&lt;/b&gt; - We&amp;#8217;re trying to run at 80K, but we&amp;#8217;re having problems with temperature stability. We talk to Ulrich, and he thinks that we&amp;#8217;ve got a partial ice plug in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LN&lt;/span&gt; line, reducing the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LN&lt;/span&gt; we can draw through.  We can either waste two hours having it replaced, or run with it as it is.  No guarantee that it won&amp;#8217;t get worse.  We decide to run with it, we&amp;#8217;ve lost too much beam time already.  Our lowest temperature seems to be&amp;nbsp;~90K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5:15&lt;/b&gt; - Data run finishes.  New crystal mounted.  New data run&amp;nbsp;started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6:30 &lt;/b&gt;- Data run finishes.  Two attempts before we get a good crystal.  Data flowing&amp;nbsp;smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7:10&lt;/b&gt; - Matt returns.  There is much&amp;nbsp;rejoicing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8:00 &lt;/b&gt;- Trying room temperature data taking.  Matt wants us to learn all the tricks this run, it seems.  Having trouble getting good&amp;nbsp;crystals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10:00 &lt;/b&gt;- Room temperature data giving us a few interesting results.  Trying a full run, but we&amp;#8217;re going to kill the crystal long before that.  X rays will kill proteins (that&amp;#8217;s why we avoid them, ourselves).  Faster at room temperature than at&amp;nbsp;100K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10:45&lt;/b&gt; - Dinner from the stuff I packed this morning.  I do love microwaved leftovers.  No rush, though.  All three of us are in the lab, and Ryan and Matt can handle whatever&amp;nbsp;comes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;11:25&lt;/b&gt; - Lots of trouble getting good crystals (4 or 5 attempts?).  220K is a hard temperature.  Finally gave up and went to&amp;nbsp;240K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;11:55&lt;/b&gt; - Ryan goes home.  He&amp;#8217;ll be back around 6 tomorrow.  I&amp;#8217;m sticking it out for a while.  Interesting data coming in around 240K.  If we&amp;#8217;re skilled and lucky, we&amp;#8217;ll get something around 220K&amp;nbsp;also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday 6/18
&lt;b&gt;12:20am&lt;/b&gt; - Potentially exciting&amp;nbsp;results!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;12:45&lt;/b&gt; - Reproducible potentially exciting&amp;nbsp;results!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1:15&lt;/b&gt; - My brain can&amp;#8217;t do simple calculations right now, but we&amp;#8217;re changing temperatures and trying out another look for our result at 240K.  I hope it&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1:20&lt;/b&gt; - Morale lower.  Possibly the effect is from a perfectly reasonable explainable thing.  What a great hour&amp;nbsp;though!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1:45&lt;/b&gt; - Data inconclusive but leaning towards no.  Heading home.  Leave Matt all by his&amp;nbsp;lonesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1:55&lt;/b&gt; - Home.  Sleep time.  Alarm set for&amp;nbsp;9.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jesse</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jun 2010 01:57:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2010-06-18:posts/life-as-an-experimenter-day-two.html</guid><category>long</category><category>CHESS</category><category>experiment</category></item><item><title>Life as an Experimenter - Day One</title><link>http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/life-as-an-experimenter-day-one.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m an experimental physicist.  If you think this sounds like a job second in glamour only to rock star you would be right.  Just like being a rock star, you have to deal with the people, the shows, the lights, the groupies &amp;#8230; okay, maybe I&amp;#8217;m lying about the groupies.  Unless you&amp;#8217;re &lt;a href="http://groups.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=groups.groupprofile&amp;amp;groupID=103575126"&gt;Brian Greene&lt;/a&gt;.  Also similar to a rock star, no one really knows what it is we do behind the scenes (when we&amp;#8217;re not touring the nation or publishing papers).  I&amp;#8217;d like to pull back that curtain a little&amp;nbsp;bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A bit of background.  For this data run we&amp;#8217;re looking at the structure of protein crystals.  The basic idea is that if you have a bunch of proteins, you can create a crystal out of them using various synthesis techniques.  If they&amp;#8217;re formed right, they look similar to the crystals you are more familiar with, quartz, diamond, emerald, etc.  We&amp;#8217;re interested in how the proteins are held in the crystal, that is, what kind of structure the protein crystal has.  I&amp;#8217;ll talk more about this at some other point.  Our method for examining this is using x rays.  Similar to a medical x-ray, we shoot x-rays at our sample, and look at the transmitted images.  Of course, instead of something like this:
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_SYZpxZOlcb0/TBpWZFChfhI/AAAAAAAAABs/Cp-4Rf5ca5Y/s1600/X-ray-hands.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="228" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_SYZpxZOlcb0/TBpWZFChfhI/AAAAAAAAABs/Cp-4Rf5ca5Y/s320/X-ray-hands.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;we see something like this:
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_SYZpxZOlcb0/TBpWqG2OqLI/AAAAAAAAAB0/SncRJvsz1Uk/s1600/20071104200851!X-ray_diffraction_pattern_3clpro.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_SYZpxZOlcb0/TBpWqG2OqLI/AAAAAAAAAB0/SncRJvsz1Uk/s320/20071104200851!X-ray_diffraction_pattern_3clpro.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;which is a little bit harder to interpret.  Nevertheless, we&amp;#8217;ve got some pretty nifty software that will do the job for us.  The unfortunate part about using x-rays is that to produce research grade x-rays takes really big expensive facilities, so we have a limited amount of time we get to use them for.  Right now, we&amp;#8217;ve got 48 hours of beam time, so we want to take data for as many of those 48 hours as possible.  For those interested, we&amp;#8217;re using &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHESS&lt;/span&gt; at Cornell, station&amp;nbsp;F1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wednesday, 6/16
&lt;b&gt;9:30am &lt;/b&gt;- Get up.  I was warned by the postdoc in my group to sleep in as much as I could.  Our data run starts at noon, and goes for 48 hours.  Who knows how much sleep we&amp;#8217;ll get in those 48 hours.  Our beam time starts at noon today.  I eat breakfast, and realize that I&amp;#8217;ve left my lab notebook in the lab.  I need to swing by there and pick it&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10:52&lt;/b&gt; - Out of the house.  My goal is to be at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHESS&lt;/span&gt; by 11.  As this is my first time using the facility,  I need to get a safety tour before I can use the beam line.  I hope on my bike and speed towards to the physics&amp;nbsp;building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10:54&lt;/b&gt; - Downpour.  I get soaked.  I&amp;#8217;m wearing a rain jacket, but my jeans and shoes are soaked&amp;nbsp;through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10:55 &lt;/b&gt;- A pocket on my backpack comes unzipped, dumping my water bottle (and, as I find out later, my bike lock) into the road.  I stop and retrieve the water&amp;nbsp;bottle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;11:02&lt;/b&gt; - Arrive at physics building.  Hasten to the lab, dripping water.  Grab notebook.  Receive call from Ryan, another graduate student in the lab, saying he&amp;#8217;s at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHESS&lt;/span&gt;, and ready to take the safety tour when I&amp;nbsp;am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;11:12 &lt;/b&gt; - Arrive at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHESS&lt;/span&gt;.  Realize I don&amp;#8217;t have my bike lock anymore.  Call Ryan and tell him to take the tour without me, I&amp;#8217;ll get to it later.  Hop on bike, ride route in reverse.  Find lock right where water bottle fell&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;11:25&lt;/b&gt; - Back at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHESS&lt;/span&gt;.  Check in.  Get given safety tour, radiation badge.  Meet up with Ryan.  Good&amp;nbsp;times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;11:59&lt;/b&gt; - Matt, the postdoc in my lab, with experience at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHESS&lt;/span&gt; and the samples and equipment,&amp;nbsp;arrives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;12:00pm&lt;/b&gt; - Beam time starts.  We&amp;#8217;re not ready.  For this run, we&amp;#8217;re using liquid helium to cool our sample.  We have to get that set up&amp;nbsp;first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1:45&lt;/b&gt; - With the aid of Ulrich, one of the Research Associates at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHESS&lt;/span&gt;, we have the liquid helium stream set up to cool our&amp;nbsp;sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2:00 &lt;/b&gt;- Matt trains Ryan and myself how to mount samples for the&amp;nbsp;beam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2:15&lt;/b&gt; - Matt mounts a sample, and trains Ryan and myself how to operate beam&amp;nbsp;controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2:30 &lt;/b&gt;- Start taking&amp;nbsp;data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2:45 &lt;/b&gt;- Crystal turns out to be not very crystalline.  Rinse and&amp;nbsp;repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4:00&lt;/b&gt; - After 7 increasingly frustrating attempts with bad crystals, the 8th turns out to give us a good signal.  Looks like we&amp;#8217;re back in&amp;nbsp;business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4:15&lt;/b&gt; - Getting anomalous signals from our sample.  Every 5th image has about have the intensity of the others.  Also getting some weird tiling in the image.  No one knows what&amp;#8217;s going on.  We call in Ulrich and the beam&amp;nbsp;operator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4:30 &lt;/b&gt;- In the midst of trying to resolve the anomalous signals, the computer we&amp;#8217;re running the experimental control software on goes down.  Requires calling in more tech&amp;nbsp;support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4:50 &lt;/b&gt;- I take a break to eat.  First food since breakfast.  Two sandwiches and a half-frozen banana (kept it near the back of the fridge in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHESS&lt;/span&gt; lounge.  I learned my&amp;nbsp;lesson).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5:10&lt;/b&gt; - Food eaten.  Computer back up.  Data taking ready.  Still no resolution for the anomalous signal.  While the experts continue to trouble shoot, Matt attempts to figure out if we can run any of our experiments with the data as bad as it currently&amp;nbsp;is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5:45&lt;/b&gt; - Still no solution.  Matt has determined that none of our planned experiments will work with the data as bad as it is.  Suspicion of a bad detector (a million dollar piece of equipment).  Morale is&amp;nbsp;low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8:00&lt;/b&gt; - After continued trouble shooting, Ulrich is convinced that the problem is a bad shutter for the x ray beam (just like a camera, you achieve a certain image exposure by letting the beam hit the sample/detector for a certain amount of&amp;nbsp;time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8:30&lt;/b&gt; - Technician arrives to swap shutters.  Operation successful!  Data looks&amp;nbsp;good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9:00&lt;/b&gt; - After some test runs, we start taking real data.  Morale is&amp;nbsp;high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;11:15&lt;/b&gt; - Data coming in with no sign of stopping.  Ryan and I head home.  Matt has the night shift, we&amp;#8217;re to relieve him at 8 the next&amp;nbsp;morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;11:20 &lt;/b&gt;- Discover that my bike has somehow broken while sitting on the bike rack.  The collar that keeps the handlebars in the frame is loose, and the handlebars no longer connect with the front wheel.  Bike is&amp;nbsp;unrideable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;11:25&lt;/b&gt; - Decide bike is unfixable with current tools.  I have to walk it&amp;nbsp;home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;11:40&lt;/b&gt; - Home.  Attempt to fix bike. Discover none of my wrenches are quite large&amp;nbsp;enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;11:45 &lt;/b&gt;- Food.  Microwave leftovers.  Discover one of my housemates has left fresh chocolate chip cookies on the counter for the rest of the house.  Bless her a thousand times over and eat&amp;nbsp;two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
Thursday 6/17
&lt;b&gt;12:15am&lt;/b&gt; - Set alarm for 7:15am, and hop into&amp;nbsp;bed.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jesse</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jun 2010 13:53:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2010-06-17:posts/life-as-an-experimenter-day-one.html</guid><category>CHESS</category><category>long day</category><category>experiment</category></item></channel></rss>
