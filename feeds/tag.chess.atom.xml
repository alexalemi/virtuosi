I started
during my sophomore year in college, went straight to graduate school,
and continued here (albeit not quite immediately). There are people out
there who have been doing this for a lot longer than I have, but I&amp;#8217;ve
gained a few insights, by working with said people, and through my own
experiences in the lab. I thought I&amp;#8217;d try to share a few of these, to
help illuminate the past few days I blogged about. &lt;strong&gt;Something Always
Goes Wrong&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#8217;s the nature of experimental science. Something always
goes wrong. It might be your equipment, it might be your sample, hell,
it might be something personal. But something will go wrong. Wednesday
was a prime example. Not only did I get soaked by rain and temporarily
lose my bike lock, but it took us 9 hours to really start taking data
due to equipment problems. I think this is endemic in what we&amp;#8217;re doing.
We&amp;#8217;re trying to investigate something that no one has ever done (at
least not quite exactly what we&amp;#8217;re doing). This means that we&amp;#8217;re usually
pushing the bounds of our equipment and setup. Not just that, but most
of the equipment is exceedingly complex, giving it many more places it
can break down. &lt;strong&gt;It&amp;#8217;s An Emotional Roller Coaster&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes nothing
works. At all. You try and try and you just can&amp;#8217;t make it work. Then
sometimes everything is going well. You&amp;#8217;re getting data, and not just
that, but the data looks good. Whether it&amp;#8217;s confirming or destroying
your expectations, you&amp;#8217;re finding out something new about the world.
It&amp;#8217;s exciting. You find something interesting and start chasing it.
However, you have to be careful. Often the result is not what you think
you&amp;#8217;re seeing. It&amp;#8217;s a false signal from your equipment, or attributable
to the background material doing something strange. Or you&amp;#8217;ve destroyed
the sample, and that&amp;#8217;s why it&amp;#8217;s not doing what you expect. You go up and
down quite a bit. &lt;strong&gt;It&amp;#8217;s Exhausting&lt;/strong&gt; Part of it is the long hours. But
really, 16 hour days are not *that* bad. Sleeping 6.5-7 hours. I can
usually do that, no problem. So what&amp;#8217;s different when it&amp;#8217;s research? You
have to be thinking all the time. For 16 hours. In general, you can&amp;#8217;t
just push the button and wait. You need to look at the data while it
comes in, to determine what data to take next. Combine that with the
emotional up and down &amp;#8230; even though you&amp;#8217;re not necessarily
physically exhausted, you&amp;#8217;re mentally worn out. &lt;strong&gt;You Get More Questions
Than Answers&lt;/strong&gt; My undergraduate advisor would always say that when
you&amp;#8217;re doing research you generate three questions for every question
you answer. That&amp;#8217;s more or less true. It is very rare to go out and
answer all the questions you have. It is even more rare to not get more
questions. There&amp;#8217;s always more to learn. In many ways, that&amp;#8217;s great,
though a little frustrating. If we ran out of questions, we&amp;#8217;d probably
run out of a job. But there&amp;#8217;s always another twist that you didn&amp;#8217;t
expect nature to have, something else surprising you. That&amp;#8217;s why we do
it. There&amp;#8217;s no finality in research. We can&amp;#8217;t get all the answers, ever.
A lot of our time isn&amp;#8217;t data taking, but making/setting up our
equipment, analyzing data, and such things. Still, I hope that this
series of posts has given you a taste of what we scientists may do when
we&amp;#8217;re taking&amp;nbsp;data.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="reflection"></category><category term="CHESS"></category><category term="experiment"></category></entry><entry><title>Life as an Experimenter - Day Three</title><link href="/posts/life-as-an-experimenter-day-three.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-06-18T13:49:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Jesse</name></author><id>tag:,2010-06-18:posts/life-as-an-experimenter-day-three.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today marks the third and final day in our beam time at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHESS&lt;/span&gt;. I think
the circles under all of our eyes may take away from the glamor a bit,
but the right makeup specialist could fix that. If they ever make a
movie about us, which they should, I want to be played by some really
awesome british actor. I think that would be about right. Someone with a
strong jaw. In case it&amp;#8217;s not obvious, lack of sleep is getting to me a
little bit. Read on for the final few hours of our experiment.
Friday 6/18
&lt;strong&gt;9:07am&lt;/strong&gt; - Not sure if I didn&amp;#8217;t turn on my alarm, or turned it off
without noticing. But somehow I manage to jerk awake not too much later
than planned. Dragging a little bit. Get some food. No time for shower,
do that in a few hours. Only have to get through to noon.
&lt;strong&gt;9:41&lt;/strong&gt; - Leave house. Hop in car. Realize as I drive through that
there&amp;#8217;s a stop sign at a corner that I didn&amp;#8217;t see last night, mostly
hidden by trees. Very glad there wasn&amp;#8217;t any traffic.
&lt;strong&gt;9:54&lt;/strong&gt; - Arrive back at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHESS&lt;/span&gt;. Set up laptop to stream the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; game.
Get a report from Matt and Ryan. Looks like the data that was exciting
last night is actually repeatable, and though it is a small effect,
probably real. This is a very nice bonus for our experiment, we were
mostly expecting null results from that phase of things. Plan is to test
that more, run some experiments to make sure we&amp;#8217;re not seeing other,
more mundane, effects that would look the same with our collection
methods.
&lt;strong&gt;10:25&lt;/strong&gt; - I take over crystal mounting. Matt is busy with data, and
Ryan is not having luck with crystals this morning. That&amp;#8217;s how it goes.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; is down a goal. Morale low for that reason.
&lt;strong&gt;10:45&lt;/strong&gt; - Data taking going okay. Still seeing the effect, though
small. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; down 2 goals. Not good at all.
&lt;strong&gt;11:00&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; down 1 goal! Oh yes. Some experiment. We&amp;#8217;re almost done,
not paying too much attention any more. Everyone is slowing down.
&lt;strong&gt;11:20&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHESS&lt;/span&gt; staff members keep on wandering into our area and
staying to watch the game. Kind of fun. One got us an ethernet cable to
eliminate some of the pauses we were getting in the streaming using the
wireless. Set up a final run, determine if the effect is from what we
suspect (hope?) or from mundane causes. Need to pack up and be out in 40
minutes.
&lt;strong&gt;11:45&lt;/strong&gt; - Experiment finishes. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; is robbed! Should have been a
victory.
&lt;strong&gt;11:50&lt;/strong&gt; - Mad scramble to pack up equipment. Crystals, mounts,
computers, etc.
&lt;strong&gt;11:58&lt;/strong&gt; - Off the beam.
&lt;strong&gt;12:05pm&lt;/strong&gt;- Parking permit returned. On my way home. Taking the rest of
the day off.
I hope that you, dear reader, have enjoyed this brief taste of how
experiments go. I tried to let the emotions reflect what I actually was
feeling at the time, but often for the most harrowing/exciting parts
there was no time to write, so much of this has been upon reflection.
Tomorrow I hope to offer a few insights into how experiments usually
seem to go. A lot of people have never done experimental science, and
experimentation in movies is &lt;a href="http://xkcd.com/683/"&gt;very different&lt;/a&gt; from
what we actually do. Now it&amp;#8217;s time to sleep. And maybe watch the
England/Algeria&amp;nbsp;game.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="CHESS"></category><category term="experiment"></category></entry><entry><title>Life as an Experimenter - Day Two</title><link href="/posts/life-as-an-experimenter-day-two.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-06-18T01:57:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Jesse</name></author><id>tag:,2010-06-18:posts/life-as-an-experimenter-day-two.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today I&amp;#8217;m continuing my series on the life of an experimenter. Today is
the longest day, since we have beam time for all 24 hours. And after the
setbacks of yesterday, we feel compelled to use it to the utmost bit.
Read on for more tantalizing glimpses of the grit behind the glamor of
the rock-star-like lifestyle of an experimental physicist. Today had a
very different feel. Things were working, and that meant a lot of down
time waiting for data to collect. Despite the excitement of data coming
in, I was a little bored at points. Lots of internet use. Thursday 6/17
&lt;strong&gt;7:15am&lt;/strong&gt; - Alarm goes off. 6.5 hours of sleep? Up quickly, and eat and
shower. Run into a couple of my housemates that I normally don&amp;#8217;t. I
don&amp;#8217;t feel to tired. Which is good, because I don&amp;#8217;t usually do caffeine,
if I had to now, it might well mess me up. &lt;strong&gt;7:50&lt;/strong&gt; - Out of the house.
Taking my car, since my bike isn&amp;#8217;t working. &lt;strong&gt;8:05&lt;/strong&gt; - At the F1
station. Matt is there, awake, looking not too much worse for ware. Ryan
comes in right behind me. I have to get a parking permit, which &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHESS&lt;/span&gt;
kindly provides for visiting researchers. Since my car isn&amp;#8217;t registered
on campus, I qualify as a visiting researcher. &lt;strong&gt;8:10&lt;/strong&gt; - Matt briefs us
on the progress of the night. Some good data was taken, and we&amp;#8217;ve
switched from the helium to a liquid nitrogen (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LN&lt;/span&gt;) cooling. He lays out
the set of experiments we should try to run today. Obvious that he needs
sleep. &lt;strong&gt;8:45&lt;/strong&gt;- Matt goes home. Ryan and myself are on our own. Start a
data run. &lt;strong&gt;9-10&lt;/strong&gt; - All the staff are checking in on us. After the
problems of yesterday, they want to make sure everything is running
smoothly. Which it is. &lt;strong&gt;10:30&lt;/strong&gt; - Data running smoothly. When
everything goes well, for this particularly type of data set, there&amp;#8217;s
not much to be done while it&amp;#8217;s coming in. Put on the Greece vs. Nigeria
world cup game, streaming on my laptop. &lt;strong&gt;11:30&lt;/strong&gt; - Data run finished.
Load up a new crystal smooth as can be. Start another data set.
Everything working like a charm. &lt;strong&gt;12:30pm&lt;/strong&gt; - Lunch break. Much more
relaxed today. &lt;strong&gt;2:00&lt;/strong&gt; - Data run done. Switching to a different type
of data run &lt;strong&gt;2:15&lt;/strong&gt; - New run starts. Smooth sailing so far. &lt;strong&gt;2:30&lt;/strong&gt; -
Put on Mexico vs. France world cup game. &lt;strong&gt;3:30&lt;/strong&gt; - Attempting to start
a new run. Took us three or four tries to find a new crystal that was
good. Run good to go. &lt;strong&gt;4:15&lt;/strong&gt; - We&amp;#8217;re trying to run at 80K, but we&amp;#8217;re
having problems with temperature stability. We talk to Ulrich, and he
thinks that we&amp;#8217;ve got a partial ice plug in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LN&lt;/span&gt; line, reducing the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LN&lt;/span&gt;
we can draw through. We can either waste two hours having it replaced,
or run with it as it is. No guarantee that it won&amp;#8217;t get worse. We decide
to run with it, we&amp;#8217;ve lost too much beam time already. Our lowest
temperature seems to be \~90K. &lt;strong&gt;5:15&lt;/strong&gt; - Data run finishes. New crystal
mounted. New data run started. &lt;strong&gt;6:30&lt;/strong&gt;- Data run finishes. Two attempts
before we get a good crystal. Data flowing smoothly. &lt;strong&gt;7:10&lt;/strong&gt; - Matt
returns. There is much rejoicing. &lt;strong&gt;8:00&lt;/strong&gt;- Trying room temperature data
taking. Matt wants us to learn all the tricks this run, it seems. Having
trouble getting good crystals. &lt;strong&gt;10:00&lt;/strong&gt;- Room temperature data giving
us a few interesting results. Trying a full run, but we&amp;#8217;re going to kill
the crystal long before that. X rays will kill proteins (that&amp;#8217;s why we
avoid them, ourselves). Faster at room temperature than at 100K.
&lt;strong&gt;10:45&lt;/strong&gt; - Dinner from the stuff I packed this morning. I do love
microwaved leftovers. No rush, though. All three of us are in the lab,
and Ryan and Matt can handle whatever comes. &lt;strong&gt;11:25&lt;/strong&gt; - Lots of trouble
getting good crystals (4 or 5 attempts?). 220K is a hard temperature.
Finally gave up and went to 240K. &lt;strong&gt;11:55&lt;/strong&gt; - Ryan goes home. He&amp;#8217;ll be
back around 6 tomorrow. I&amp;#8217;m sticking it out for a while. Interesting
data coming in around 240K. If we&amp;#8217;re skilled and lucky, we&amp;#8217;ll get
something around 220K also. Friday 6/18 &lt;strong&gt;12:20am&lt;/strong&gt; - Potentially
exciting results! &lt;strong&gt;12:45&lt;/strong&gt; - Reproducible potentially exciting results!
&lt;strong&gt;1:15&lt;/strong&gt; - My brain can&amp;#8217;t do simple calculations right now, but we&amp;#8217;re
changing temperatures and trying out another look for our result at
240K. I hope it&amp;#8217;s there! &lt;strong&gt;1:20&lt;/strong&gt; - Morale lower. Possibly the effect is
from a perfectly reasonable explainable thing. What a great hour though!
&lt;strong&gt;1:45&lt;/strong&gt; - Data inconclusive but leaning towards no. Heading home. Leave
Matt all by his lonesome. &lt;strong&gt;1:55&lt;/strong&gt; - Home. Sleep time. Alarm set for&amp;nbsp;9.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="long"></category><category term="CHESS"></category><category term="experiment"></category></entry><entry><title>Life as an Experimenter - Day One</title><link href="/posts/life-as-an-experimenter-day-one.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-06-17T13:53:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Jesse</name></author><id>tag:,2010-06-17:posts/life-as-an-experimenter-day-one.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m an experimental physicist. If you think this sounds like a job
second in glamour only to rock star you would be right. Just like being
a rock star, you have to deal with the people, the shows, the lights,
the groupies &amp;#8230; okay, maybe I&amp;#8217;m lying about the groupies. Unless
you&amp;#8217;re &lt;a href="http://groups.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=groups.groupprofile&amp;amp;groupID=103575126"&gt;Brian
Greene&lt;/a&gt;.
Also similar to a rock star, no one really knows what it is we do behind
the scenes (when we&amp;#8217;re not touring the nation or publishing papers). I&amp;#8217;d
like to pull back that curtain a little bit. A bit of background. For
this data run we&amp;#8217;re looking at the structure of protein crystals. The
basic idea is that if you have a bunch of proteins, you can create a
crystal out of them using various synthesis techniques. If they&amp;#8217;re
formed right, they look similar to the crystals you are more familiar
with, quartz, diamond, emerald, etc. We&amp;#8217;re interested in how the
proteins are held in the crystal, that is, what kind of structure the
protein crystal has. I&amp;#8217;ll talk more about this at some other point. Our
method for examining this is using x rays. Similar to a medical x-ray,
we shoot x-rays at our sample, and look at the transmitted images. Of
course, instead of something like this:
&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_SYZpxZOlcb0/TBpWZFChfhI/AAAAAAAAABs/Cp-4Rf5ca5Y/s1600/X-ray-hands.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_SYZpxZOlcb0/TBpWZFChfhI/AAAAAAAAABs/Cp-4Rf5ca5Y/s320/X-ray-hands.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
we see something like this:
&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_SYZpxZOlcb0/TBpWqG2OqLI/AAAAAAAAAB0/SncRJvsz1Uk/s1600/20071104200851!X-ray_diffraction_pattern_3clpro.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_SYZpxZOlcb0/TBpWqG2OqLI/AAAAAAAAAB0/SncRJvsz1Uk/s320/20071104200851!X-ray_diffraction_pattern_3clpro.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
which is a little bit harder to interpret. Nevertheless, we&amp;#8217;ve got some
pretty nifty software that will do the job for us. The unfortunate part
about using x-rays is that to produce research grade x-rays takes really
big expensive facilities, so we have a limited amount of time we get to
use them for. Right now, we&amp;#8217;ve got 48 hours of beam time, so we want to
take data for as many of those 48 hours as possible. For those
interested, we&amp;#8217;re using &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHESS&lt;/span&gt; at Cornell, station F1. Wednesday, 6/16
&lt;strong&gt;9:30am&lt;/strong&gt;- Get up. I was warned by the postdoc in my group to sleep in
as much as I could. Our data run starts at noon, and goes for 48 hours.
Who knows how much sleep we&amp;#8217;ll get in those 48 hours. Our beam time
starts at noon today. I eat breakfast, and realize that I&amp;#8217;ve left my lab
notebook in the lab. I need to swing by there and pick it up. &lt;strong&gt;10:52&lt;/strong&gt;
- Out of the house. My goal is to be at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHESS&lt;/span&gt; by 11. As this is my first
time using the facility, I need to get a safety tour before I can use
the beam line. I hope on my bike and speed towards to the physics
building. &lt;strong&gt;10:54&lt;/strong&gt; - Downpour. I get soaked. I&amp;#8217;m wearing a rain jacket,
but my jeans and shoes are soaked through. &lt;strong&gt;10:55&lt;/strong&gt;- A pocket on my
backpack comes unzipped, dumping my water bottle (and, as I find out
later, my bike lock) into the road. I stop and retrieve the water
bottle. &lt;strong&gt;11:02&lt;/strong&gt; - Arrive at physics building. Hasten to the lab,
dripping water. Grab notebook. Receive call from Ryan, another graduate
student in the lab, saying he&amp;#8217;s at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHESS&lt;/span&gt;, and ready to take the safety
tour when I am. &lt;strong&gt;11:12&lt;/strong&gt; - Arrive at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHESS&lt;/span&gt;. Realize I don&amp;#8217;t have my
bike lock anymore. Call Ryan and tell him to take the tour without me,
I&amp;#8217;ll get to it later. Hop on bike, ride route in reverse. Find lock
right where water bottle fell out. &lt;strong&gt;11:25&lt;/strong&gt; - Back at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHESS&lt;/span&gt;. Check in.
Get given safety tour, radiation badge. Meet up with Ryan. Good times.
&lt;strong&gt;11:59&lt;/strong&gt; - Matt, the postdoc in my lab, with experience at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHESS&lt;/span&gt; and
the samples and equipment, arrives. &lt;strong&gt;12:00pm&lt;/strong&gt; - Beam time starts.
We&amp;#8217;re not ready. For this run, we&amp;#8217;re using liquid helium to cool our
sample. We have to get that set up first. &lt;strong&gt;1:45&lt;/strong&gt; - With the aid of
Ulrich, one of the Research Associates at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHESS&lt;/span&gt;, we have the liquid
helium stream set up to cool our sample. &lt;strong&gt;2:00&lt;/strong&gt;- Matt trains Ryan and
myself how to mount samples for the beam. &lt;strong&gt;2:15&lt;/strong&gt; - Matt mounts a
sample, and trains Ryan and myself how to operate beam controls.
&lt;strong&gt;2:30&lt;/strong&gt;- Start taking data. &lt;strong&gt;2:45&lt;/strong&gt;- Crystal turns out to be not very
crystalline. Rinse and repeat. &lt;strong&gt;4:00&lt;/strong&gt; - After 7 increasingly
frustrating attempts with bad crystals, the 8th turns out to give us a
good signal. Looks like we&amp;#8217;re back in business. &lt;strong&gt;4:15&lt;/strong&gt; - Getting
anomalous signals from our sample. Every 5th image has about have the
intensity of the others. Also getting some weird tiling in the image. No
one knows what&amp;#8217;s going on. We call in Ulrich and the beam operator.
&lt;strong&gt;4:30&lt;/strong&gt;- In the midst of trying to resolve the anomalous signals, the
computer we&amp;#8217;re running the experimental control software on goes down.
Requires calling in more tech support. &lt;strong&gt;4:50&lt;/strong&gt;- I take a break to eat.
First food since breakfast. Two sandwiches and a half-frozen banana
(kept it near the back of the fridge in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHESS&lt;/span&gt; lounge. I learned my
lesson). &lt;strong&gt;5:10&lt;/strong&gt; - Food eaten. Computer back up. Data taking ready.
Still no resolution for the anomalous signal. While the experts continue
to trouble shoot, Matt attempts to figure out if we can run any of our
experiments with the data as bad as it currently is. &lt;strong&gt;5:45&lt;/strong&gt; - Still no
solution. Matt has determined that none of our planned experiments will
work with the data as bad as it is. Suspicion of a bad detector (a
million dollar piece of equipment). Morale is low. &lt;strong&gt;8:00&lt;/strong&gt; - After
continued trouble shooting, Ulrich is convinced that the problem is a
bad shutter for the x ray beam (just like a camera, you achieve a
certain image exposure by letting the beam hit the sample/detector for a
certain amount of time). &lt;strong&gt;8:30&lt;/strong&gt; - Technician arrives to swap shutters.
Operation successful! Data looks good. &lt;strong&gt;9:00&lt;/strong&gt; - After some test runs,
we start taking real data. Morale is high. &lt;strong&gt;11:15&lt;/strong&gt; - Data coming in
with no sign of stopping. Ryan and I head home. Matt has the night
shift, we&amp;#8217;re to relieve him at 8 the next morning. &lt;strong&gt;11:20&lt;/strong&gt;- Discover
that my bike has somehow broken while sitting on the bike rack. The
collar that keeps the handlebars in the frame is loose, and the
handlebars no longer connect with the front wheel. Bike is unrideable.
&lt;strong&gt;11:25&lt;/strong&gt; - Decide bike is unfixable with current tools. I have to walk
it home. &lt;strong&gt;11:40&lt;/strong&gt; - Home. Attempt to fix bike. Discover none of my
wrenches are quite large enough. &lt;strong&gt;11:45&lt;/strong&gt;- Food. Microwave leftovers.
Discover one of my housemates has left fresh chocolate chip cookies on
the counter for the rest of the house. Bless her a thousand times over
and eat two. &lt;strong&gt;** Thursday 6/17 &lt;/strong&gt;12:15am** - Set alarm for 7:15am, and
hop into&amp;nbsp;bed.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="CHESS"></category><category term="long day"></category><category term="experiment"></category></entry></feed>
