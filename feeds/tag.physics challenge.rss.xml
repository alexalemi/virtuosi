&lt;p&gt;[&lt;i&gt;Update:  Prize Update / Added link to full solutions&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the second Physics Challenge Award show!
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;[&lt;span class="caps"&gt;APPLAUSE&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;Our judges have deliberated for several units of time and I now have in my hands the envelope holding our list of winners.  I could easily just tell you who won right now and save everyone some time, but award shows need some suspense to work effectively, so let&amp;#8217;s first give some tedious background information!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;[&lt;span class="caps"&gt;APPLAUSE&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;You may recall that the winner of the first &lt;a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2011/03/physics-challenge-award-show.html"&gt;Physics Challenge&lt;/a&gt; contest won a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRC_Handbook_of_Chemistry_and_Physics"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CRC&lt;/span&gt; Handbook&lt;/a&gt;.  We will not be giving out CRCs this time around.  We felt that such a prize was far too &lt;strike&gt;expensive&lt;/strike&gt; impersonal, so we have opted this year for something &lt;strike&gt;much cheaper&lt;/strike&gt; from the heart.  The following prizes will be awarded to our top three solutions:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;First Prize:&lt;/b&gt;  Our first prize winner will receive an actual back-of-an-envelope used in one of our posts (gasp!) signed by all the of the members of the Virtuosi that I can find at colloquium tomorrow.  But that&amp;#8217;s not all!  Alemi will also salute in your general direction.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Second Prize:&lt;/b&gt;  For our second prize winner, we appear to have run out of envelopes&amp;#8230; but Alemi will still salute in your general direction.  You will not see him do this, but you will feel a major disturbance in the Awesome Force (mediated, of course, through the midi-chlorian boson).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Third Prize:&lt;/b&gt;  You will receive no material prize, but on your deathbed you will receive &lt;i&gt;total consciousness&lt;/i&gt;.  So you&amp;#8217;ve got that going for you, which is nice.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s first remind everyone what the Challenge problem was.  The full text of the problem can be found &lt;a href="http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~aalemi/challenge/timemachine.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but the gist is basically this:  You&amp;#8217;ve created a time machine and you&amp;#8217;re biggest fear is that you&amp;#8217;ll be stuck back in the past without any way to communicate to the future that your design worked and you deserve all kinds of Nobel prizes.  The solution should be able to last long periods of time (who knows how far back in time you&amp;#8217;ll go?), should maximize the chances of modern people finding it, and be able to convince people that you have in fact gone back in time.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;Alright, let&amp;#8217;s get to some solutions already!  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;First Place:&lt;/b&gt;  The first place solution comes from Christian, who uses some biological wrangling to solve the time traveller conundrum.  With some information from the &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/craig_venter_unveils_synthetic_life.html"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; of &amp;#8220;synthetic life&amp;#8221; and some bio how-to from an entity known only as &amp;#8220;steve,&amp;#8221; Christian plans to implant a message into the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt; of bacteria.  The message will contain his name, identifying information, and the url of a website which will (presumably) contain a video of him with one hand outstretched saying &amp;#8220;Nobel prize please.&amp;#8221;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s see how this solution satisfies our criteria for a successful solution.  &lt;i&gt;Does it work for an arbitrary amount of time?&lt;/i&gt;  It appears to, so long as the bacteria manage to survive and the message doesn&amp;#8217;t become too garbled over time (perhaps some error-correction might be useful).  Additionally, if one is worried about introducing non-native bacteria to the wild you could bring back a bunch of bacteria that were known to exist over wide periods of time and just release those alive at the time.  &lt;i&gt;Will modern humans find it?&lt;/i&gt;  It seems that geneticists are decoding just about any genome they can get their hands on, so this is a strong possibility.  &lt;i&gt;Would it convince people that someone travelled in time?&lt;/i&gt;  If the bacteria has dispersed enough, shows enough variation over geographic regions, and contains specific identifying information about a missing person who has allegedly created a time machine, I think that&amp;#8217;s pretty strong evidence.  Neato, gang!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Second Place:&lt;/b&gt;  The second place solution comes from Kyle, who offers a space-based answer.  Kyle suggests etching detailed plans of the time travel mechanism (flux capacitor) onto a durable metal and putting that bad boy into space.  He suggests that anyone capable of building a fully functional time machine should have no problem launching a small satellite.  Fair enough.  Additionally, the satellite would use some kind of solar power or the like to produce a low-power radio signal.  In fact, this signal would only need to spit something out once every year or ten years or something.  Since radio communication precedes space exploration, the detection of an artificial satellite sending a message would attract a fair deal of attention.  The plans and successful reproduction of the time machine would then seal the deal.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;Does this solution satisfy the necessary conditions?  I think so.  Assuming all goes according to plan, this would easily be detected by modern people and, assuming the time machine plans are accurate, would provide indisputable proof.  My main concern would be that the satellite could be launched and survive to the present.  Modern satellites need constant boosts to stay in orbit, without which they fall back onto Earth and burn up.  One potential solution would be to put it on the Moon.  This is technically much more difficult, but hey, you just created a time machine!  Also, putting it on the moon then allows for a totally rad recreation of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolith_(Space_Odyssey)"&gt;Monolith&lt;/a&gt; scene in &lt;i&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/i&gt;.     &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Third Place:&lt;/b&gt;  The third place solution comes from Yariv.  Though Yariv did not submit a solution through the proper channels (he follows no one&amp;#8217;s rules, not even his own), he was overheard to give a solution.  While the Physics Challenge planning committee was discussing the problem over lunch, Yariv flippantly dismissed the entire premise as &amp;#8220;trivial&amp;#8221; and suggested a two-word solution:  &amp;#8220;radioactive paint.&amp;#8221;  Personally, I like the idea of bewildered archaeologists finding a cave painting of Yariv riding a dinosaur done using a variety of radioactive paints which all date back 200 million years.  For this amusement, I award Yariv the third place prize for this contest.  As a member of the Virtuosi, however, Yariv is ineligible to receive a prize and instead receives 5 demerits on his record for his willful disregard of our institution&amp;#8217;s rules and excessive flippancy.  One more slip-up and you&amp;#8217;ll lose your badge!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~aalemi/challenge/timemachinesol.php"&gt;Full solutions&lt;/a&gt; are up on the Challenge website.  Thanks for joining us for this episode of Physics Challenge Award Show, and thanks to everyone who submitted a&amp;nbsp;response!   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;First and Second Prize Winners:&lt;/b&gt;  We present the following in partial fulfillment of our prize&amp;nbsp;offer.&lt;/p&gt;

of time to submit his solution&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know that our &lt;a href="http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~aalemi/challenge/timemachine.php"&gt;Physics Challenge&lt;/a&gt; problem contest thingy is still up and going?  It is!  The contest will be open until the end of the day this &lt;b&gt;Friday, November 4th&lt;/b&gt;.  And, unlike last time, the winning solution will be chosen and posted by the end of the weekend.  So even if you don&amp;#8217;t submit your own solution (though you &lt;i&gt;totally&lt;/i&gt; should), check back here Monday morning for the winning&amp;nbsp;entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why should you submit a solution to our problem?  Lots of reasons!  The top ten reasons as decided by a random sample of me are given below the&amp;nbsp;break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Top Ten Reasons to Submit a&amp;nbsp;Solution:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1)  You will win super-awesome prizes!  What kinds of prizes?  Well how does a greeting card with kittens on the front and a collection of encouraging haikus from the entire Virtuosi staff written inside sound?  It sounds awesome, awesome to the&amp;nbsp;max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2)  You get to show off your totally rad physics&amp;nbsp;skills!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3)  You can put it on your resume/cv!  The semi-annual Virtuosi Physics Challenge problem winners are held to the same esteem as Fields Medalists and Nobel Prize&amp;nbsp;winners!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4)  You will earn the respect and admiration of your peers!  Winners of this contest develop an aura that all other people can see, fear, and&amp;nbsp;respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5)  You will become stronger, faster, and more productive than ever before!  This is a scientifically proven fact&amp;nbsp;perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6)  You may gain the ability to talk to animals!  Have you ever wanted to discuss espionage-related topics with a platypus (perhaps this &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONgjXrOShlc"&gt;platypus&lt;/a&gt;)?  Of course you have!  Winners&amp;nbsp;can!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7)  You will be in Presidential company!  Did you know William Henry Harrison won the very first Virtuosi physics challenge contest shortly before becoming the ninth President of the United States?  Yep!  Tippecanoe and so can&amp;nbsp;you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8)  Alemi will salute in your general direction.  No questions&amp;nbsp;asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9)  You will give me work to do on the weekend!  This will give my dull and uninteresting life a small glimmer of meaning!&amp;nbsp;Hooray!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10) There&amp;#8217;s like a 50% chance that you will get three wishes from a magical genie named David Bowie (no relation).  Seriously.  Like&amp;nbsp;50%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That should get you properly motivated!  So check out the Challenge Problem &lt;a href="http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~aalemi/challenge/timemachine.php"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; and when you have a solution, send it to our email address (given up in the&amp;nbsp;sidebar).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good&amp;nbsp;luck!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Corky</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 31 Oct 2011 22:30:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2011-10-31:posts/physics-challenge-update.html</guid><category>desperate plea</category><category>physics challenge</category><category>hooray</category></item><item><title>Physics Challenge II: Marty McPhysics</title><link>http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/physics-challenge-ii-marty-mcphysics.html</link><description>&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cuT_VPl_Yd8/TmQbG_7B5DI/AAAAAAAAAOs/DA9sTNI-nGk/s1600/greatscott.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cuT_VPl_Yd8/TmQbG_7B5DI/AAAAAAAAAOs/DA9sTNI-nGk/s1600/greatscott.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Doc Brown didn&amp;#8217;t have a time-travel backup plan.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of the incredible success of our last Physics Challenge Problem (we received &lt;i&gt;several&lt;/i&gt; responses), we here at the Virtuosi have decided to reinstate what was nominally a &amp;#8220;monthly&amp;#8221; contest.  In addition to a brand-spankin&amp;#8217;-new problem (with &amp;#8220;prizes&amp;#8221;, see [1]), we have also tried to make a nice collaborative environment for discussing interesting physics problems and posting your own solutions.  So I will discuss our &lt;a href="http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~aalemi/challenge/timemachine.php"&gt;new problem&lt;/a&gt; and then I&amp;#8217;ll throw it over to Alemi to discuss the goal of our new Physics Challenge&amp;nbsp;webpage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Our last challenge problem (&lt;a href="http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~aalemi/challenge/archive.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, with winning solutions) was deemed a bit &amp;#8220;unrealistic&amp;#8221; by many because it assumes that you were shipwrecked on a desert island &lt;i&gt;with a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CRC&lt;/span&gt; handbook!&lt;/i&gt;  What a ridiculous situation!  Fear not, dear readers, we have heard your complaints and have adjusted accordingly.  Our new problem relies on a far less ridiculous&amp;nbsp;assumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assume you have created a time machine out of a DeLorean [2].  You are sure it will send you back in time and, causality-be-damned, you are ready to give it a test drive.  But you are less confident in the machine&amp;#8217;s ability to take you exactly &lt;i&gt;when&lt;/i&gt; you want.  Additionally, the positive tachyonic chrono-coupler is a bit finicky - meaning, of course, that there is a non-negligible chance that once you go back in time, you may never be able to come &lt;i&gt;Back to the Present&lt;/i&gt;.  Thus, there is a chance that your time machine will have worked but no one will ever&amp;nbsp;know!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an unabashed narcissist, you find this totally unacceptable!  But first and foremost, you are a scientist.  As a scientist, your challenge is to design a strategy that would allow you to convince your present-day scientific peers that you did travel back in the time even if you are stuck in the past.  What could you build/make/leave in the past that would be most likely to convince modern scientists that it &lt;i&gt;had&lt;/i&gt; to be from a time-traveler and not just some hoaxer?  How long would your strategy be effective?  Would it work if you were stuck ten thousand years in the past?  What about a million years in the past?  What about 100&amp;nbsp;million?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though this is an inherently silly problem, we feel that the idea behind it is a very interesting one.  What could one motivated person do/build/make that would survive a long time into the future?  Also, the winning solution will be submitted as a policy White Paper for all future&amp;nbsp;time-travelers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#8217;s the new problem.  You can find the &amp;#8220;official&amp;#8221; posting &lt;a href="http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~aalemi/challenge/timemachine.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  I now cede the floor and my remaining time to the gentleman from&amp;nbsp;Wisconsin.     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A sense of&amp;nbsp;community&amp;#8230;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we&amp;#8217;ve had this blog going for a while now, and we get a decent number of comments on our posts, but felt as though something has been lacking.  A certain sense of community.   Over the past year, we&amp;#8217;ve done some neat things here, and now it&amp;#8217;s your turn.  Step right up, because we&amp;#8217;ve just launched a google groups: &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/thevirtuosi"&gt;TheVirtuosi&lt;/a&gt; where we hope people from all corners of the globe will gather to discuss their kooky physics&amp;nbsp;projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you recently explored the physics of cats?  Launch a discussion.  Do you have an idea but need some help investigating it?  Create a discussion and query us and all of our fantastic readers.  Have an idea for a blog post you want to see?  Let us know.  Want to take a stab at solving one of the newly minted &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/physicschallenge"&gt;Physics Challenge&lt;/a&gt; problems in public?  Go for&amp;nbsp;it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know the site is sparse now, but we&amp;#8217;d really like to build a little bit of a community here, so please, post away.  You all have already bookmarked it I&amp;#8217;m sure, but a permanent link has been added to the top of the sidebar as well. That is&amp;nbsp;all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] These &amp;#8220;prizes&amp;#8221; will no longer be as exciting as the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CRC&lt;/span&gt; from last time, for several reasons.  First of all, we are all poor grad students and have no money.  Secondly, the winners from last time lived as far away from us as physically possible and it&amp;#8217;s expensive to ship heavy things.  So what can you expect to win?  Well, you could win a &amp;#8220;certificate of accomplishment&amp;#8221; which would just be drawn in crayon by one of this.  But it will be made with love!  Or you could win a floppy disk with a recording of my very own version of the Jurassic Park theme. The surprise is part of the fun (I&amp;#8217;m&amp;nbsp;told).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2] Quoth the most famous chrononaut of our time, Dr. Emmett Brown: &amp;#8220;The way I see it, if you&amp;#8217;re gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some&amp;nbsp;style?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Corky</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 05 Sep 2011 14:16:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2011-09-05:posts/physics-challenge-ii-marty-mcphysics.html</guid><category>physics challenge</category><category>time travel</category><category>great scott</category></item><item><title>Physics Challenge Award Show</title><link>http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/physics-challenge-award-show.html</link><description>&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-pyHug0rZ0X0/TYGM0O4fznI/AAAAAAAAAK0/ZTrk9NSTYuw/s1600/macgyver.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="236" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-pyHug0rZ0X0/TYGM0O4fznI/AAAAAAAAAK0/ZTrk9NSTYuw/s320/macgyver.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;In an emergency, Richard Dean Anderson&amp;#8217;s mullet can

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the First Physics Challenge Problem Award Show!  We received an integer number of solutions to our challenge problem and at long last and after much deliberation, we have chosen our&amp;nbsp;winner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had before indicated vaguely that there may be some sort of prizes involved in this competition.  After consultation with our financial advisors and breaking Alemi&amp;#8217;s piggy bank, we have decided on the following&amp;nbsp;prizes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Place:  A brand new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CRC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Handbook!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second Place: An autographed [1] picture of Scott&amp;nbsp;Bakula!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honorable Mention:  Nothing!&amp;nbsp;[2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;So before we officially announce our winner, let&amp;#8217;s backtrack and build up some suspense.  The challenge was to come up with a bunch of MacGyveresque experiments to determine as closely as possible the standard second, meter and kilogram using only the materials handy to you on a desert [3]&amp;nbsp;island. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just about every response we got successfully answered the question, so we had to base our final result on robustness and uncertainties.  We also tended to favor those that did not rest on precise knowledge of one&amp;#8217;s own height, weight, etc (though there is nothing wrong with these approaches).  So without further ado, the winner&amp;nbsp;is&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[pause]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[unnecessarily long secondary&amp;nbsp;pause]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George from Australia!  George provided a list of no fewer than 11 different methods for determining the second, meter and kilogram.  The second was found by timing (by means of a pendulum) the time it takes for the sun to move through an a given angle measure.  This measurement can be made each day for a year to get the best results (remember, you&amp;#8217;ve got all the time in the world!).  Now we have the time it takes the sun to go through a given angle measured in &amp;#8220;swings of a pendulum.&amp;#8221;  We can calculate the transit time of the sun into seconds and then we can find the number of seconds per swing of the pendulum.  So now we have a second.  But since the period of a pendulum is given&amp;nbsp;by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ T = 2\pi \sqrt{l/g}, $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we also have the length of the pendulum in meters.  From this we can make a standard meter.  Now all that is left is to find the kilogram.  This can be done by making a water-tight enclosure of volume 1000 cm^3 and filling it with water, giving a kilogram that can be compared to other objects to get a longer lasting standard kilogram.  Any other knowledge you may have (i.e. known height and weight) may be used to check the above&amp;nbsp;measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very close second place goes to Alireza, who provided a very strong submission and perhaps one of the best uses of snail mucus in the entire competition!  Alireza&amp;#8217;s solution was to use one&amp;#8217;s own known height to construct the standard meter.  From this you can make a pendulum to get the second and a box o&amp;#8217; water (sealed with tar, glue and snail mucus) to get the&amp;nbsp;kilogram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both George and Alireza provided very detailed responses with special attention paid toward reducing uncertainty and checking their answers through several independent measurements.  They also both carried out parts of their experiments.  Congratulations to you&amp;nbsp;both!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the winning responses, we also received several other submissions that merit honorable mention.  They&amp;nbsp;are&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oliver, who provided several acoustical experiments using his &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SUPERPOWER&lt;/span&gt; of perfect&amp;nbsp;pitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole, who noted that we were not correct in giving the Titanic the designation &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty%27s_Ship"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HMS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; as this is reserved for ships in the British Royal Navy.  In fact, the Titanic was designated &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Mail_Ship"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; since it carried mail.  Thanks,&amp;nbsp;Nicole!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary, who completely ignored the premise, used arbitrary units and left a very amusing note on his deathbed giving all his arbitrary units to be found and converted by the first enterprising explorer who lands on his island.  I know you had asked for your prize in cash and while I cannot directly accomodate that wish, do know that Richard Dean Anderson smiles can be cashed in most banks nationwide (see&amp;nbsp;[2]). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So thanks to everyone who submitted a response to this Challenge.  We enjoyed reading all of the solutions and we hope you had fun thinking about it.  And next time you go on a boat, don&amp;#8217;t forget that&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CRC&lt;/span&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  Autograph will be signed by me on an 8.5&amp;#8221; x 11&amp;#8221; picture of Scott Bakula printed by a laser printer on regular copy&amp;nbsp;paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  Well, you receive nothing of monetary value but, know deep down in your hearts that in the picture at the top of this post, Richard Dean Anderson is smiling at you.  So you&amp;#8217;ve got that going for you, which is&amp;nbsp;nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  Sadly, we did not choose a dessert island.  That would have been much more&amp;nbsp;fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Corky</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 17 Mar 2011 23:30:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2011-03-17:posts/physics-challenge-award-show.html</guid><category>physics challenge</category><category>macguyver</category><category>scott bakula</category></item><item><title>Problem of the Month: Gilligan Physics</title><link>http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/problem-of-the-month-gilligan-physics.html</link><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TU7ghJWo1oI/AAAAAAAAAQg/PCnPJ4aM9Ig/s1600/coconut.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear:left; float:left;margin-right:1em; margin-bottom:1em"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" width="238" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TU7ghJWo1oI/AAAAAAAAAQg/PCnPJ4aM9Ig/s320/coconut.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, some of us over here at Virtuosi Central have organized a challenge problem for the physics community here at Cornell.  Well, we thought we would open up the challenge to the great wide world.  The more submissions the&amp;nbsp;merrier.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deadline is March 1, and submissions can be sent to our&amp;nbsp;email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details can be found at &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/physicschallenge"&gt;bit.ly/physicschallenge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck and happy&amp;nbsp;hunting.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Alemi</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2011 12:55:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2011-02-06:posts/problem-of-the-month-gilligan-physics.html</guid><category>CRC</category><category>physics challenge</category><category>fun</category><category>standards</category><category>gilligan</category></item></channel></rss>
