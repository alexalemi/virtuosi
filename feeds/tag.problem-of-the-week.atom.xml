  Cold-Blooded&amp;nbsp;Killer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello all and welcome to to another roundup of Problem of the Week. If
the time intervals don&amp;#8217;t seem to be adding up, just remember that &amp;#8220;week&amp;#8221;
is an illusion here at Virtuosi headquarters. &amp;#8220;Problem of the Week,&amp;#8221;
doubly so. But enough with the excuses, let&amp;#8217;s see if Mr. Bond lives to
Die Another Day. The situation presented in the problem was one of a
glass of water filled all the way to the top with a single ice cube in
it. The goal is to see if any water falls to the floor as the ice cube
melts. The simplest analysis would be to just consider the displacement
of water by the ice cube. By Archimedes&amp;#8217; principle we know that the
buoyant force on the ice cube is equal to the weight of the water
displaced by the ice cube. But since the ice cube is floating, we know
that the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the ice cube.
Therefore, the ice cube just displaces it&amp;#8217;s own weight in water. So as
the ice cube melts, the water level stays the same and no water is
spilled over. Stated a bit more explicitly, we have that the buoyant
force is the weight of the displaced water: &lt;mathjax&gt;$$ F_b = m_{water}g =
{\rho}_{water}V_{water}g $$&lt;/mathjax&gt; where we have just expressed the mass of
the water as the density of water times the volume of the water
displaced. Likewise, the weight of the ice cube is &lt;mathjax&gt;$$ W_{ice} =
m_{ice}g = {\rho}_{ice}V_{ice}g $$&lt;/mathjax&gt; But since the ice cube is
floating, the buoyant force is equal to the weight. Setting the above
equations equal to each other and rearranging a bit, we can solve for
the volume of the water displaced by the ice cube: &lt;mathjax&gt;$$ V_{water} =
\frac{{\rho}_{ice}V_{ice}}{{\rho}_{water}} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt; Great, now we have
the volume of water that the ice cube displaced, so now we just need to
see what volume of water the ice cube will add once it melts. Since we
know that the mass of ice cube better be the same as the mass of the
water left after it melts, we can write &lt;mathjax&gt;$$ {\rho}_{ice}V_{ice} =
{\rho}_{water}V_{water} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt; which gives that the total volume of the
water is just
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ V_{water} = \frac{{\rho}_{ice}V_{ice}}{{\rho}_{water}} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
which is exactly the same volume we found before. Therefore, when the
ice cube melts it fills up exactly the same amount of volume as the
water displaced to hold up the ice cube, so the water level remains the
same and James Bond lives!
Or does he? Well, he sure does if the system is entirely described by
the analysis above. But we need to be exact here since a single drop
would set off the Koala death trap. We have considered the biggest
contributions to the change of volume of the water (and easiest to
calculate!), but we have ignored a large number of much much smaller
effects on the volume. Typically these effects would be swept aside and
callously labeled &amp;#8220;negligible,&amp;#8221; but since even the smallest change of
volume could mean life or death for our hero, they must be accounted for
to give a final &amp;#8220;exact&amp;#8221; answer.
Unfortunately, &amp;#8220;exact&amp;#8221; isn&amp;#8217;t something science can do very well. We can
only do as good as the measurements we make allow. And since I gave you
practically no information, this was very tough. However, one could
consider the magnitude of the effects given typical values and see which
side wins out. But if two competing effects give similar values under
reasonable conditions, it becomes very difficult to give an answer.
The last two &amp;#8220;Problems of the Week&amp;#8221; were well posed math problems, each
with a clear-cut &amp;#8220;correct&amp;#8221; answer. This one was a physics problem and
physics is a lot messier than math. That may initially seem less
satisfying, but it means that there is a whole lot of interesting &amp;#8220;mess&amp;#8221;
to sort out! I really enjoyed reading the
&lt;a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/11/problem-of-week-3.html#more"&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt;
detailing all the neat small effects to the change of volume that I
ignored in my solution. Density variations as a function of temperature,
surface tension effects, evaporation and thermal expansion all play some
role in determining the final answer. There&amp;#8217;s a whole lot of interesting
physics going on!
Without knowing the exact conditions a bit more and doing a whole lot
more work, it seems as though I will not be able to provide a final
physics solution. But, having seen just about every Bond movie, I can
give an answer with a certainty not afforded to me by science: Mr. Bond
lives. How do I know this? Well, it is common knowledge that James Bond
has tiny smoke grenades in the soles of his shoes that release a potent
koala knock-out potion specifically created by Q. So Bond releases these
into the koala death pit, rendering the vicious beasts harmless. Then he
uses his watch laser to cut any bindings Dr. Cherrycoke may have placed
him in, falling into the death pit. The fall leaves Mr. Bond uninjured,
as a cuddly mass of sleeping koalas break his fall. By stacking the
koalas into a rudimentary series of steps, Mr. Bond ascends out of the
death pit and free to save the world&amp;#8217;s ice supply from the evil Dr.
Cherrycoke.&amp;nbsp;Obviously.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="koalas"></category><category term="problem of the week"></category><category term="scott bakula"></category></entry><entry><title>Problem of the Week #2: Solution</title><link href="http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/problem-of-the-week-2-solution.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-11-23T17:46:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Holmes</name></author><id>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2010-11-23:posts/problem-of-the-week-2-solution.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thanks to all who sent in solutions! We are very happy with the vast
number of responses, and we will put up a leader board shortly! Solution
Let A be the fraction of the rubber band that the ant has traversed.
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$A\left(t\right)=\frac{x\left(t\right)}{L+vt}.$$&lt;/mathjax&gt; The ant&amp;#8217;s
velocity relative to any point along the rubber band is equal to the
length of the rubber band times the first time derivative of A:
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$u=\left(L+vt\right)\frac{dA}{dt}=\left(L+vt\right)\left[\frac{\dot{x}}{L+vt}-\frac{vx}{\left(L+vt\right)^{2}}\right]=\dot{x}-\frac{vx}{L+vt}.$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
This gives us an inseparable, first-order differential equation for
x(t). The general differential equation of this type,
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$\dot{x}+p\left(t\right)x=q\left(t\right),$$&lt;/mathjax&gt; has the general
solution &lt;mathjax&gt;$$x\left(t\right)=e^{-\int_{0}^{t}
p\left(t\right)dt}\int_{0}^{t} q\left(t\right)e^{\int_{0}^{t}
p\left(t\right)dt}dt.$$&lt;/mathjax&gt; In our case,
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$p\left(t\right)=-\frac{v}{L+vt},\quad q\left(t\right)=u.$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
Therefore, &lt;mathjax&gt;$$x\left(t\right)&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;e^{\int\frac{v}{L+vt}dt}\int
ue^{-\int\frac{v}{L+vt}dt}dt=\frac{u}{v}\left(L+vt\right)\ln\left(1+\frac{vt}{L}\right).$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
When the ant has reached the other side, x(t) = L + vt, so
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$x\left(t\right)=L+vt=\frac{u}{v}\left(L+vt\right)\ln\left(1+\frac{vt}{L}\right).$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
Solving for t, we get &lt;mathjax&gt;$$t=\frac{L}{v}\left(e^{v/u}-1\right).$$&lt;/mathjax&gt; So
the ant always makes it to the other side (unless u = 0)! In the limit
as v -&gt; 0, we get &lt;mathjax&gt;$$t\approx\frac{L}{u},$$&lt;/mathjax&gt; which is exactly what we
would expect. We can show that the ant will reach the other side without
doing any calculations. As the ant moves across the rubber band, the
velocity of the point on the rubber band that the ant is currently
walking on increases from 0 to v. Therefore, the ant is accelerating.
Since the other end of the rubber band is moving at a constant velocity,
the accelerating ant will always eventually catch up to the far end.
Another way to see this is that since the ant is accelerating, if it
makes it halfway, it will make it all the way to the other side; if it
makes it one-quarter of the way, it will make it halfway, and so on. We
know that since the ant is traveling at some nonzero velocity, it must
make it some nonzero fraction of the way to the other side. Therefore,
it must make it twice that far, and so on, all the way to the other
side.

James Bond has been captured by the evil mastermind Dr. Vontavious
Cherrycoke, who is trying to take over the world&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Cube"&gt;ice
cube&lt;/a&gt; supply. The minions of Dr.
Cherrycoke have placed Mr. Bond in an elaborate and unnecessary death
contraption that, if triggered, would drop our hero into a pit of
ravenous killer koalas. In other words, certain death! Dr. Cherrycoke
has constructed a fitting trigger for his death machine / koala feeder.
A single ice cube is placed in a glass of water so that the water is
completely filling the glass up to the brim. The glass of water is then
placed on a very sensitive detector. If even a single drop of water
spills out of the glass as the ice cube melts, James Bond will find
himself on the wrong end of a murderous marsupial mauling.
Vontavious exits the room with his minions, confident that his death
trap will be triggered and Bond will be vanquished once and for all.
Does Mr. Bond survive? If not, roughly how long does it take until he
checks in to the big &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MI6&lt;/span&gt; in the sky?

A rubber band is held fixed at one end. The other end is pulled at a
velocity v. At time t = 0, the rubber band has a length of L, and an ant

on The Virtuosi. Starting this week, a new problem of the week will be
posted each week. Solutions will be posted the following week. These
problems will be a collection of physics and math problems and riddles,
and although hopefully challenging enough to be fun and interesting,
they should mostly be solvable using concepts from introductory
undergraduate physics and math classes.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;We welcome you to ponder these problems, and send in solutions, or even
any ideas you have about how to solve the problems
to&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:the.physics.virtuosi@gmail.com"&gt;&lt;em&gt;the.physics.virtuosi@gmail.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;with

Virtuosi problem solvers.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Here it goes…&lt;strong&gt;*Maximizing Gravity&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;
You are given a blob of Play-Doh (with a fixed mass and uniform density)
that you can shape however you choose. How can you shape it to maximize
the gravitational force at a given point &lt;/em&gt;P* on the surface of the
Play-Doh?
Solution
In cylindrical coordinates, where the point P is taken to be the origin,
the z-component of the gravitational field due to any point (s, z) felt
at the origin, is proportional to
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$\frac{1}{s^{2}+z^{2}}\frac{z}{\sqrt{s^{2}+z^{2}}},$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
where the second factor is necessary to take the z-component. If we have
azimuthal symmetry, the magnitude of the gravitational field is given by
the sum of all the z-components of the forces due to all points in the
planet. For a given contour
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$\frac{z}{\left(s^{2}+z^{2}\right)^{3/2}}=C,$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_kdZd6FJQtZQ/TN9Jgv8f9gI/AAAAAAAAAAM/qdRknJVbCT0/s1600/maxgravity.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_kdZd6FJQtZQ/TN9Jgv8f9gI/AAAAAAAAAAM/qdRknJVbCT0/s320/maxgravity.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
for some constant C, each point on the interior contributes more to the
total gravitational field than each point on the exterior. Thus, the
gravitational field is maximized if the surface of the planet takes the
shape of one of these contours. Solving for s(z), we
get&lt;mathjax&gt;$$s\left(z\right)=\sqrt{\left(\frac{z}{C}\right)^{2/3}-z^{2}}.$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
If the length of the planet in the z-direction is &lt;mathjax&gt;$$z_0,$$&lt;/mathjax&gt; we can
replace C in the above expression to get
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$s\left(z\right)=\sqrt{\left(z_{0}^{4}z^{2}\right)^{1/3}-z^{2}}.$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
As can be seen by the plot above, this shape looks a lot like a sphere,
but slightly smushed toward the point of interest P. We can rigorously
compare the field of the maximal gravity solid to that of a sphere with
the same volume. The volume of the maximal solid is given by
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$V=\pi\int_{0}^{z_{0}}s^{2}\left(z\right)dz=\pi\int_{0}^{z_{0}}\left[\left(z_{0}^{4}z^{2}\right)^{1/3}-z^{2}\right]dz=\frac{4\pi}{15}z_{0}^{3}$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
The volume of a sphere of radius r is of course &lt;mathjax&gt;$$V=\frac{4}{3}\pi
r^{3},$$&lt;/mathjax&gt; so in order for the volumes to be the same, the sphere must
have a radius of &lt;mathjax&gt;$$r=z_{0}/5^{1/3}.$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
The acceleration due to the maximal solid is proportional to
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$a_{max}=\int dVa_{z}=2\pi
G\rho\int_{0}^{z_{0}}dz\int_{0}^{s\left(z\right)}sds\frac{z}{\left(s^{2}+z^{2}\right)^{3/2}}=\frac{4\pi
G\rho z_{0}}{5},$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
while the acceleration due to the sphere is just
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$a_{sphere}=\frac{G\rho\frac{4}{3}\pi r^{3}}{r^{2}}=\frac{4\pi
G\rho z_{0}}{3\cdot5^{1/3}}.$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
Thus, we have
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$\frac{F_{max}}{F_{sphere}}=\frac{4\pi G\rho z_{0}/5}{4\pi
G\rho
z_{0}/\left(3\cdot5^{1/3}\right)}=\frac{3}{5^{2/3}}\approx1.026.$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
So the solid that gives the maximum gravitational field at a point is
only about 3% better than a sphere.
