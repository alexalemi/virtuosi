&lt;p&gt;In honor of earth day today, many bloggers are posting things about how to save the earth, or retrospectives on earth days past.  We here at The Virtuosi decided, what better way to celebrate the earth than to figure out how to destroy it?  So that is exactly what we intend to do.  This post will focus on the destruction of the earth by a laser beam.  This is a familiar concept.  Whether it is Marvin the Martian or the Death Star, destroying planets with lasers (or threatening to) is a common theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object height="200" width="249"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/djZFHTa6TfA&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/djZFHTa6TfA&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be considering two questions today.  The first is fairly obvious:  how much power would the death star need to destroy the earth?  The second relates to a topic of continuing interest of mine: how much would the death star recoil upon firing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;First, the power we would need.  Most estimates of the death star's power seem to rely on simply overcoming the gravitational binding energy of the earth.  We're going to assume the earth is a uniform density.  We can easily calculate the gravitational binding energy to be
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$U_G=\frac{3GM_{earth}^2}{5R_{earth}}$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$U=2.3\cdot 10^{32} J$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
However, looking at the video of the death star blast, it looks like the earth was more than just gravitationally unbound.  It looks like we've actually managed to atomize some of the constituent molecules.  Let us assume that about half of the earth gets atomized.  We're also going to assume that the earth is made entirely of iron (not &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; bad an assumption).  In a lattice, iron will have ~6 bonds, and the energy of each bond will be on the order of ~2 eV.  We can calculate the number of iron atoms, N, needed to give the mass of the earth by:
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$N=\frac{M_{earth}}{m_{iron}}$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$N=3\cdot 10^{50} atoms$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We assume half of these have all of their bonds broken, this gives an energy required to break the bonds of
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$E \approx 3N(2eV)=2.88\cdot 10^{32} J$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
This gives us a total destruction energy of
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$E_{tot}=5.2\cdot 10^{32} J$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
Analyzing the video of the firing of the first death star tells us that the laser fired for about 4s, so this is a power of 1.3*10^32 W!  As an aside, that much energy is about the total energy output of the sun over a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means the impulse this laser delivered (momentum per second, or force) to the death star must be the power over c, the speed of light (see my &lt;a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/04/today-id-like-to-approach-question-near.html"&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt; for a discussion of laser gun recoil).  This is a force of 4.3*10^23 N.  We now need to estimate the death star mass.  According to &lt;a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Death_Star"&gt;confidential sources&lt;/a&gt; the death star had a diameter of 150 km.  The death star is made of metal, but it also has a lot of empty space inside of it.  We'll go ahead and assume it has the density of water.  This gives is a mass of
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$M_{ds}=\tfrac{4}{3}\pi r^3\rho=2.4\cdot 10^{13} kg$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
A quick glance at our numbers reveals that we're going to need special relativity here!  Otherwise we'd be accelerating this thing well past the speed of light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a total momentum change of 1.7&lt;em&gt;10^{24}kg&lt;/em&gt;m/s.  This is a relativistic momentum, which we can solve for v.  The algebra is a tiny bit ugly, but it turns out that velocity in terms of relativistic momentum is
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$v=\sqrt{\frac{p^2}{m^2+p^2/c^2}} \approx c $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
It turns out that the death star would be moving so close to speed of light as to not matter.  That's fast!  I think we can safely say that this laser recoil would be noticed!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jesse</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 22 Apr 2010 14:26:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2010-04-22:posts/end-of-the-earth-ii-blaze-of-glory.html</guid><category>star wars</category><category>recoil</category><category>marvin the martian</category><category>lasers</category><category>end of the earth</category></item><item><title>Laser Gun Recoil: Follow-up</title><link>http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/laser-gun-recoil-follow-up.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Matt Springer over at &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/builtonfacts/"&gt;Built on Fact&lt;/a&gt;s has a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/builtonfacts/2010/04/laser_rifle_recoil.php"&gt;very nice post&lt;/a&gt; following up on my earlier analysis of &lt;a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/04/today-id-like-to-approach-question-near.html"&gt;whether or not a laser gun would recoil&lt;/a&gt;.  In my analysis I came to the conclusion that the momentum delivered was much less than that of a conventional gun, but that the impulse, and hence the force delivered, was about the same.  However, that force was delivered over a ~30ns timescale, which left open the question of whether or not the wielder would be able to feel that recoil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I had thought to possibly return to this issue at some point, Matt has beat me to it.  This is fortuitous, because I wasn't sure quite where to start with the question, while he approaches it in a very sensible, clear manner.  The gist of his post is that he compares our response to short time scale forces to our ability to sense sound.  I won't go through his calculations, you can check those out for yourself, but he concludes that it is very unlikely that we could feel the recoil of our laser gun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case closed.  Though, like any good scientist, we may choose to reopen it later if more evidence comes to light.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jesse</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 21 Apr 2010 16:31:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2010-04-21:posts/laser-gun-recoil-follow-up.html</guid><category>recoil</category><category>laser</category><category>sound</category><category>momentum</category><category>gun</category></item><item><title>Would a laser gun recoil?</title><link>http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/would-a-laser-gun-recoil-.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Today I'd like to approach a question near and dear to many a geek heart: do laser guns have recoil?
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_SYZpxZOlcb0/S76cWh0vVrI/AAAAAAAAAA8/3AVsx5suF0A/s1600/19990814dogfight.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_SYZpxZOlcb0/S76cWh0vVrI/AAAAAAAAAA8/3AVsx5suF0A/s200/19990814dogfight.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Let's motivate our question a little bit.  I've wondered about this question since I saw star wars.  Though I'm no firearms expert, the recoil in guns must come from conservation of momentum principles.  Momentum is conserved in a system.  The gun starts with zero momentum.  We fire, give the bullet momentum, and so to keep the system at zero momentum, the gun must gain equal and opposite momentum.  That is, the gun will move backwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of that was for conventional guns.  Light carries momentum, so if we fire a pulse of light, we expect our laser gun to recoil.  So yes, they do have recoil.  Satisfied, dear readers?  Neither am I.  The question we really mean to ask is, does a laser gun have noticeable recoil?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to make a few reasonable assumptions.  Let's assume that the laser gun fires a pulse with as much energy as a bullet has kinetic energy, KE.  The energy, E, of light is related to its momentum, p, by E=pc, where c is the speed of light.  This gives a momentum of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ E=KE=pc $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ p=\frac{KE}{c}$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the kinetic energy of a bullet?  A little searching reveals that a .22 bullet is ~2.5g and fires with a muzzle velocity of ~330m/s.  Kinetic energy is given by KE=1/2mv^2, where m is mass and v velocity.  So, the momentum of a laser pulse with equal energy would be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ p=\frac{mv^2}{2c} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ p=\frac{.0025kg*(330m/s)^2}{2*3\cdot 10^8m/s} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ p=4.5\cdot10^{-7}kg \cdot m/s $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For comparison, the momentum (p=mv) of a .22 bullet is .83 kg*m/s.  The momentum of a laser gun is 2 million times less than the momentum of a .22.  But is momentum all we should consider?  I suspect the 'kick' we feel on the recoil is directly related to the force that the gun exerts on the holder.  This means that instead of momentum we need to consider impulse, momentum per time.  We estimate the time it takes to fire a .22 is ~.1s, so the force delivered 8.3 N. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's estimate the time it takes a laser gun to fire.  Unfortunately, not having a laser gun to fire (feel free to send me one, dear readers), we're more or less going to have to guess at the firing time.  Most movies with laser guns show pulses of light (which, incidentally would move so fast we wouldn't see them) on the order of a meter or two long.  Given the speed of light, this would give a firing time of ~30 nanoseconds.  This would give a force delivered of 15 N.  This is close to what we estimated or a .22.  So, if movies are to be believed (and really, why wouldn't we believe them?), it seems like laser guns may well have recoil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note:  It is worth questioning if we need the same energy for a laser as for a bullet.  That could certainly change our estimate.  Maybe we'll return to this question again.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jesse</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 08 Apr 2010 23:16:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2010-04-08:posts/would-a-laser-gun-recoil-.html</guid><category>recoil</category><category>laser</category><category>momentum</category></item></channel></rss>
