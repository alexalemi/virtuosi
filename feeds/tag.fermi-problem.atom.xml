&lt;p&gt;So, some you may remember when I attempted to calculate how much the
oceans would lower if you took out all of the fish in an &lt;a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/04/fishy-calculation.html"&gt;earlier
post&lt;/a&gt;.
Well, the results came in a while ago, but I forgot to mention that &lt;a href="http://diaryofnumbers.blogspot.com/2010/05/we-have-winner.html"&gt;I
lost&lt;/a&gt;
the contest. I was about two orders of magnitude off from the winning
answer. In light of my failure, I&amp;#8217;m going to try again in the &lt;a href="http://diaryofnumbers.blogspot.com/2010/05/hamster-powered-mansions.html"&gt;newest
contest&lt;/a&gt;.
This time the question is a bit&amp;nbsp;stranger:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many buff hamsters would it take to completely power a&amp;nbsp;mansion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encourage all of The Virtuosi readers to enter as well, it only takes
a minute to come up with some number.

I assume everyone has heard of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_core"&gt;The
Core&lt;/a&gt;, the terrible scifi movie
from 2003. If you haven&amp;#8217;t you&amp;#8217;re missing out on what appears to be,
according to Discover magazine, &lt;a href="http://discovermagazine.com/2007/nov/none-found"&gt;the worst sci-fi film
ever&lt;/a&gt;. There are
already numerous sites that discuss the bad science in the core
(&lt;a href="http://geolor.com/The_Core_Movie-Facts_and_Fiction.htm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, or over
at &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/movies/thecore_review.html"&gt;Bad
Astronomy&lt;/a&gt;),
but they all seem to ignore another fundamental problem with the plot. I
don&amp;#8217;t think I&amp;#8217;ll give too much away if I tell you that the basic premise
of the movie is that the earth&amp;#8217;s core has stopped rotating, and so the
earth&amp;#8217;s magnetic field is collapsing, which they claim will mean that
all of the previously deflected microwaves (note: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt; radiation is not
bent by a magnetic field) will cook us all. Now, a lot of people have
focused on the microwaves bit, which while bad science, one could argue
that we would still have some bad effects from loosing our magnetic
field. The problem I have is that the Earth&amp;#8217;s magnetic field cannot
change that abruptly. I&amp;#8217;m currently teaching undergraduate honors E&amp;amp;M,
and we&amp;#8217;re working out of the fantastic texbook (unfortunately now out of
print) by
&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?ei=tn7HS87OGYKuygS9yqCNCw&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;id=3LYRAQAAIAAJ&amp;amp;dq=Purcell+Electromagnetism&amp;amp;q=#search_anchor"&gt;Purcell&lt;/a&gt;.
And in the chapter on electromagnetic induction he has an illuminating
exercise. Lets try and estimate how quickly the magnetic field of the
earth can change. Well, lets sort of work backwards. We know that if we
have a conducting ring with a current flowing through it, this will
create a magnetic field. So, if we can try and model some sort of
circuit that approximates the earth, and then look at how quickly energy
is dissipated in that circuit, we can estimate how fast the magnetic
field decays. So lets imagine a thick torus with height and width a.
Flowing around this torus is some current I, distributed in a
complicated way. The torus is made out of a material with some
conductivity sigma. Now, we know that for a wire made out of some
material with a conductivity sigma, we can estimate its resistance as &lt;mathjax&gt;$$
R = \frac{ L }{ \sigma A } $$&lt;/mathjax&gt; where L is the length, and A is the
cross sectional area of the wire. Lets do that with our torus, calling
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ A = a^2 \qquad L = 2 \pi a $$&lt;/mathjax&gt; giving us a resistance &lt;mathjax&gt;$$ R \sim
\frac{ 2 \pi }{ \sigma a } $$&lt;/mathjax&gt; To estimate the magnetic field of this
torus, lets just take the magnetic field of a loop with radius a/2. I.e.
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ B = \frac{ \mu_0 I }{2 \pi (a/2) } $$&lt;/mathjax&gt; Now we know that the energy
stored in the magnetic field is &lt;mathjax&gt;$$ U = \frac{1}{2 \mu_0 } \int B^2
\ dV \sim \frac{1}{2 \mu_0} B V $$&lt;/mathjax&gt; where we take the magnetic field
to be the magnetic field of the simple loop and V to be the volume of a
fat cylinder or so, i.e. &lt;mathjax&gt;$$ V \sim \pi a^2 \times a $$&lt;/mathjax&gt; Now if we
have a circuit with a known resistance we know that the energy is
dissipated through the resistor &lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \frac{dU}{dt} = - I^2 R $$&lt;/mathjax&gt; so if we
just want an order of magnitude estimate for the characteristic decay
time, we can take &lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \tau \sim \frac{ U }{ I^2 R } $$&lt;/mathjax&gt; Putting in our
approximations from above we have &lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \tau \sim \frac{
\frac{1}{2\mu_0 } B^2 V }{ I^2 \frac{2 \pi }{ \sigma a } } =
\frac{ \frac{1}{2 \mu_0 } ( \pi a^3 ) \left( \frac{ \mu_0 I }{
2 \pi (a/2) } \right)^2 }{ I^2 \frac{ 2 \pi }{\sigma a} } =
\frac{ \mu_0 }{4 \pi^2 } \sigma a^2 $$&lt;/mathjax&gt; where we know &lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \mu_0 =
4 \pi \times 10^{-7} N/A^2 $$&lt;/mathjax&gt; we obtain roughly (i.e. ignoring the
other pi) &lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \tau \sim \sigma a^2 \times 10^{-7} (s) $$&lt;/mathjax&gt; Now, lets
take the radius of the core to be about half the radius of the earth, or
3000 km or so, and take the conductivity of the core to be about a tenth
of that of iron at room temperature (iron becomes a worse conductor when
its heated), i.e. &lt;mathjax&gt;$$ a \sim 3000 (km) \qquad \sigma \sim 10^6 (S/m)
$$&lt;/mathjax&gt; We obtain &lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \tau \sim 10^12 (s) = 300 (centuries) $$&lt;/mathjax&gt; So, even if
you could magically make the core of the earth stop spinning, the
magnetic field is not going to change instantaneously, in fact it would
only be able to change on the order of 300 centuries or so. This is
really short on geologic time scales, but nothing like the week or so
that the movie The Core takes place over. Just one more reason why one
of the worst sci-fi movies of all time is&amp;nbsp;bad.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="the core"></category><category term="order of magnitude"></category><category term="magnetism"></category><category term="fun"></category><category term="fermi problem"></category><category term="sci-fi"></category><category term="bad physics"></category><category term="movie"></category></entry><entry><title>On the Nature of Many Penny Systems</title><link href="http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/on-the-nature-of-many-penny-systems.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-04-11T01:08:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Corky</name></author><id>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2010-04-11:posts/on-the-nature-of-many-penny-systems.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The other day I was on my way through ye olde internets to the Quantum
Leap episode index at Wikipedia, but stumbled over a quote by Feynman by
accident:
&amp;#8220;There are 10^11 stars in the galaxy. That used to be a huge number.
But it&amp;#8217;s only a hundred billion. It&amp;#8217;s less than the national deficit! We
used to call them astronomical numbers. Now we should call them
economical numbers&amp;#8221;
So this got me thinking. What if we decided to pay the national
debt&amp;#8230;in pennies? Seems fair enough, we don&amp;#8217;t really want to pay it and
when you don&amp;#8217;t want to pay something but you have to you pay it in
pennies. Hooray!
Last I heard this figure was somewhere around &lt;mathjax&gt;$10,000,000,000,000 (ten
trillion), that is:
$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$ \text{Debt} = 10^{13} \text{dollars} = 10^{15} \text{pennies} $&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$
Given that a penny is about 1.5 mm thick, how far does stacking them end
to end take us? Well:
$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$ \text{Length} = (10^{15} \text{pennies}) \times ( 0.15
\text{cm}) = 1.5 \times 10^{14} \text{cm} $&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$
As a bit of comparison, the mean distance from the earth to the sun is
$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$ \text{a} = 1.5 \times 10^{13} \text{cm,} $&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$
so our penny stack goes out to 10 AU, which just barely passes by
Saturn. Impressive!
Fine, so we've got all our pennies out now and we want to fit them in a
more economical fashion, taking advantage of all three of our
dimensions. How big is the warehouse needed to hold all these shiny
Lincolns?
Well, we know (or can guess) that one penny weighs about a gram
(technically 2.5 g). So if we were to know the density of a penny, we
would be good to go. A good guess at density for any metal is around 10
g /cm^3 , and this is true for zinc ( FUN FACT: Pennies were almost
entirely made of copper up until 1982, when they switched to 97.5% zinc,
2.5% copper). So,
$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$ \text{Mass} = (10^{15} \text{pennies}) \times ( 1 \frac{
\text{g}}{\text{penny}})= 10^{15} \text{g} $&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$
$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$ \text{Volume} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{density}} =
\frac{10^{15}\text{g}}{10 \frac{\text{g}}{\text{cm}^{3}}} =
10^{14} \text{cm}^{3}= 0.1 \text{km}}^{3} $&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$
That's a warehouse 1 km wide, 1km long, and a 100 m high. Pretty big. So
our next logical progression would be to ask: what are its gravitational
properties? To do this let's stack our pennies in a sphere. In that case
we have
$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$ \text{Volume} = \frac{4 \pi}{3} \text{R}^{3} $&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$
so
$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$ \text{R} = (\frac{3}{4 \pi} \text{Volume})^{1/3} = (\frac{3}{4
\pi} 10^{14} \text{cm}^{3})^{1/3} \approx 3 \times 10^4
\text{cm}=0.3 \text{km.} $&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$
To find the gravitational binding energy of a sphere of uniform density
we use
$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$ \text{Binding Energy} = \frac{3}{5}
\frac{\text{G}\text{M}^{2}}{R}\text{.} $&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$
So
$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$ \text{Binding Energy} = \frac{3}{5} \frac{ (7 \times 10^{-8}
\frac{cm^3}{gs^2})(10^{15} \text{g})^{2}}{3 \times 10^{4}
\text{cm}} \approx 10^{18} \text{ergs} = 10^{11} \text{Joules.} $&lt;/mathjax&gt;$
Noting that the useful measure of destruction, the kiloton of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TNT&lt;/span&gt;, is
about 10^12 J, we see that the binding energy of our spherical mass of
pennies is about 100 tons of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TNT&lt;/span&gt;. So what does this mean to us
practically? Well, the binding energy of an object essentially tells us
how much energy we need to put in to completely break up the body. So to
fully disperse our pennies off to our lendors, we need about 100 tons of
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TNT&lt;/span&gt; worth of energy.
An alternative financial fermi problem that might be interesting is how
many trees would it take to make the money to equal the national debt or&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="pennies"></category><category term="fermi problem"></category><category term="scott bakula"></category></entry><entry><title>Fishy Calculation</title><link href="http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/fishy-calculation.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-04-09T14:26:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Alemi</name></author><id>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2010-04-09:posts/fishy-calculation.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Aaron Santos over at &lt;a href="http://diaryofnumbers.blogspot.com/"&gt;A Diary of

Licks?&lt;/a&gt;,
has posted a &lt;a href="http://diaryofnumbers.blogspot.com/2010/04/fermi-contest-3.html"&gt;Fermi
Contest&lt;/a&gt;.
For the uninitiated, a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem"&gt;Fermi
Problem&lt;/a&gt; is a seemingly
unanswerable problem, which you can actually estimate reasonable by
breaking the problem down into smaller parts. They&amp;#8217;re really fun, and I
intend to post more in the future. The question at hand is: &lt;em&gt;How far
would the oceans sink if we took all the fish out?&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;#8217;ll answer in two
very different&amp;nbsp;ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Preliminaries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both cases, I&amp;#8217;ll answer how much the ocean depth would decrease by
first calculating the total volume of fish in the ocean. Why is this
helpful? Because for a spherical shell, you can estimate its volume by
just taking its surface area and multiplying by the thickness, i.e. &lt;mathjax&gt;$$ V
\sim 4 \pi R^2 \Delta R $$&lt;/mathjax&gt; So, if I can estimate the total volume of
fish in the ocean, if I take all of those fish out, change in the height
of the ocean will just be this volume divided by the surface area of the
ocean, which I will take to be the surface area of the earth times 70%
or so. Now I just need to estimate the volume of all of the fish in the&amp;nbsp;oceans&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Energy&amp;nbsp;Budget&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First I&amp;#8217;ll estimate the volume of fish in a rather general way. I&amp;#8217;ll try
to do it on energy grounds. I know how much solar energy hits the earth
per meter squared on average (340 W/m^2). I&amp;#8217;m going to assume that fish
get their energy from plankton, and plankton get their energy from the
sun, both with about 10% efficiency. I&amp;#8217;ll also assume that life occupies
as much space as possible, probably about half of the ocean surface
counts as liveable. From this I get the total energy available to make
fish. How many fish does that allow? I&amp;#8217;ll assume that fish use about as
much energy per kilogram as humans do. I know that humans have to take
in about 2000 food Calories or 2,000,000 calories a day to survive. From
this I get the total weight of all of the fish in the ocean, and for
their volume I assume they&amp;#8217;re the density of water (fish are bouyant).
My calculation: &lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \underset{\text{ \tiny mean solar flux} }{\left(
340 \frac{\text{W}}{\text{m}^2} \right)} \cdot \underset{\text{
\tiny earth surface}}{4 \pi \left( 6 \times 10^6 \text{ m}
\right)^2} \cdot \underset{\text{ \tiny frac ocean}}{(0.70)}
\cdot \underset{\text{ \tiny frac liveable} }{\left( \frac 12
\right)} = 5.4 \times 10^{20} \text{ W} \text{ (ocean life energy
budget)} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt; &lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \cdot \underset{ \text{\tiny plankton eff}}{(0.10)}
\cdot \underset{\text{\tiny fish eff}}{(0.10)} = 5.4 \times
10^{18} \text{ W} \text{ (fish energy budget)} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt; &lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \cdot
\underset{\text{\tiny energy budget of man}}{\left( \frac{ 75
\text{ kg} }{ 2 \times 10^6 \text{ cal/day} } \right)} \cdot
\underset{\text{\tiny cal $\leftrightarrow$ Ws}}{\left( \frac{ 1
\text{ cal} }{ 4 \text{ Ws} } \right)} \cdot
\underset{\text{\tiny s $\leftrightarrow$ day}}{\left( \frac{ 60
\cdot 60 \cdot 24 \text{ s} }{ 1 \text{ day} } \right)} = 4.4
\times 10^{14} \text{ kg} \text{ (mass of fish)} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt; &lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \cdot
\underset{ \rho_{\text{fish}} = \rho_{\text{water}} }{\left(
\frac{ 1 \text{ m}^3 }{ 1000 \text{ kg} } \right)} \cdot
\underset{ \text{\tiny ocean surface}}{\left( \frac{ 1}{ 4 \pi (6
\times 10^6 \text{ m})^2 (0.7) } \right)} = \text{ change in depth
(m)} = 1.38 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m} \approx 1 \text{ mm} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt; So in
the end I get about a millimeter change in the ocean height. Honestly,
this is a lot larger than I expected. The ocean is a big place. I
suppose there are also a lot of fish in the world. If you look, if we
assume the average fish is about 10 kg, I&amp;#8217;ve calculated that the
population of fish in the ocean is 4.4E13 fish, or 4 million billion
fish. That&amp;#8217;s a lot of fish. I&amp;#8217;m not so sure about my estimate, so I&amp;#8217;ll
do it again from a different&amp;nbsp;direction&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fishing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I&amp;#8217;ll try and estimate again, this time guessing based on how much
we fish fish. I know that overfishing is a problem, which means that for
some fish species we fish more than fish make little fishies, so if I
can estimate how much fish we eat, I can estimate how much we fish, so I
can estimate how many fish there are, and then I can estimate how much
the ocean depth changes. This calculation is very rough, I took some
very basic order of magnitude guesses at some of the parameters. In
particular, I had to guess how many fish species we fish, which I took
to be 1/100 for no very good reason. My calculation is below: &lt;mathjax&gt;$$
\underset{\text{ \tiny fish eaten per person}}{ \left( \frac{ 1
\text{ fish}}{ 1 \text{ week}} \right)} \cdot \underset{\text{
\tiny fish weight}}{\left( \frac{1 \text{ kg}}{1 \text{
fish}}\right)} \cdot \underset{ \text{ \tiny week
$\leftrightarrow$ year}}{ \left( \frac{ 52 \text{ weeks}}{ 1 \text{
year} }\right)} \cdot \underset{\text{\tiny people who eat
fish}}{\left( 10^9 \right)} =5.2 \times 10^{9} \text{ fish/year
fished} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt; &lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \cdot \underset{\text{\tiny fish we eat}}{ \left(
\frac{100 \text{ tot fish}}{1 \text{ fish eaten}} \right) } \cdot
\underset{\text{\tiny fish lifetime}}{\left( 10 \text{ years}
\right)} = 5.2 \times 10^{13} \text{ kg (total fish)}$$&lt;/mathjax&gt; &lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \cdot
\underset{ \rho_{\text{fish}} = \rho_{\text{water}} }{\left(
\frac{ 1 \text{ m}^3 }{ 1000 \text{ kg} } \right)} \cdot
\underset{ \text{\tiny ocean surface}}{\left( \frac{ 1}{ 4 \pi (6
\times 10^6 \text{ m})^2 (0.7) } \right)} = \text{ change in depth
(m)} = 1.6 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m} \approx 0.2 \text{ mm} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt; This
time I got 0.2 mm or so, which is in relatively good agreement with my
other number. At least its not several orders of magnitude&amp;nbsp;off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Geometric&amp;nbsp;Average&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly I trust my first number more than the second, but I&amp;#8217;m going to
average my two results in order to come up with the number that I&amp;#8217;ll
submit to the contest. But, I&amp;#8217;m not going to average my two numbers
arithmatically: &lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \mu = \frac{1}{2} ( x_1 + x_2 ) $$&lt;/mathjax&gt; as you
normally do to average numbers, instead I am going to average them
&lt;em&gt;geometrically&lt;/em&gt;, i.e. I&amp;#8217;m going to take the square root of their
product: &lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \mu = \sqrt{ x_1 x_2 } $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My&amp;nbsp;Answer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of averaging is logarithmic in nature, and my experience has
been that it is much more successful average to use when you are doing
fermi problems. Doing this on my two numbers I obtain my entry: &lt;mathjax&gt;$$
\Delta x = \sqrt{ 0.164 \text{ mm} * 1.38 \text{ mm} } \approx
\frac{1}{2} \text{ mm} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt; About half a millimeter. I&amp;#8217;ll be sure to let
everyone know how I do in the contest. Drop us an email or leave a
comment to let me know how good you think my guess is. Happy&amp;nbsp;Fishing.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="fermi"></category><category term="guestimation"></category><category term="fun"></category><category term="fermi problem"></category><category term="fish"></category></entry></feed>
