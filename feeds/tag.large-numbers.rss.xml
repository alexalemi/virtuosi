I
don&amp;#8217;t know why I do this, but I assume it&amp;#8217;s the same reason people slow
down for car wrecks and pay to see the geek [1]. Anyway, the big thing
in political news now is that if Congress can&amp;#8217;t pass a budget [2] by the
end of the day Friday, the government will shut down. Shutting down the
government means that 800,000 federal employees will go without pay [3],
lots of services will be put on hold and you won&amp;#8217;t be able to go to the
Smithsonian or the Grand Canyon. So it&amp;#8217;s kind of a big deal. Since the
ramifications of a government shutdown are so serious, there must be
some really important disagreements holding it up, right? Right? A quick
search (for example,
&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/07/us-congress-staff-government-shutdown"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;),
shows that the big hold-up in passing the budget comes over a
disagreement on how much money should be cut from the budget.
Republicans want to cut &lt;mathjax&gt;$40 billion dollars and Democrats are willing to
cut $&lt;/mathjax&gt;34.5 billion dollars. So the hold-up is over &lt;mathjax&gt;$5.5 billion. Let's
consider how utterly and stupidly insignificant this is. We shall take
as our inspiration Alemi's
[post](http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/12/law-and-large-numbers.html)
a while back offering several ways to help visualize the large and scary
sounding numbers thrown around in government budgets. The first thing
we'd like to do is find out what fraction this $&lt;/mathjax&gt;5.5 billion discrepancy
is compared to the total budget. Alemi cites the total budget of the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; government in the 2010 fiscal year to be &lt;mathjax&gt;$3.55 trillion. Hot dog!
So we see that: $&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$ \frac{\mbox{Disputed Difference}}{\mbox{Total
Budget}} = \frac{\$&lt;/mathjax&gt;5.5 \times 10^9}{\$3.55 \times 10^{12}} =
0.0015 &lt;mathjax&gt;$$ So the disputed part amounts to 0.15% of the total budget or
one and half parts in a thousand. Let's compare this to some things for
which we have a better sense of scale. Let's pretend we are looking to
buy a car. We need it to get to work and, you know, get stuff done. If
our car costs $10,000 dollars then 0.15% of our total costs will be $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
\mbox{\$10,000} \times 0.0015 = \$15 &lt;mathjax&gt;$$ So the current budget
situation is like arguing for 6 months over a $15 charge on your $10,000
car. Sounds reasonable! Now let's switch gears and consider a timescale.
Let's consider a 40 hour work week. What's 0.15% of 40 hours? This comes
to $$&lt;/mathjax&gt; 40 \mbox{ hr} \times 0.0015 = 0.06 \mbox{ hr} &lt;mathjax&gt;$$ or, if you
prefer, $$&lt;/mathjax&gt; 0.06 \mbox{ hr} \times \frac{60 \mbox{ min}}{1 \mbox{
hr}} = 3.6 \mbox{ minutes} &lt;mathjax&gt;$$ So the current budget problem is like
arguing for six months over about three and a half extra minutes to your
work week. Now let's consider a length scale. Consider the US $1 bill.
According to
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_one-dollar_bill#Small_size_notes),
the dollar bill is 6.14 inches long, 2.61 inches wide and 0.0043 inches
thick. That means that the ratio of the thickness to the width of a
dollar bill is $$&lt;/mathjax&gt; \frac{\mbox{Thickness}}{\mbox{Width}} =
\frac{0.0043 \mbox{ inches}}{2.61 \mbox{ inches}} = 0.0016 $$ or
slightly &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; than the disputed fraction of the budget. Hooray!
&amp;#8220;That&amp;#8217;s all well and nice,&amp;#8221; you say, lowering your voice and leaning
over in a way that makes me uncomfortable, &amp;#8220;but who is to &lt;em&gt;blame&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;#8221;
That&amp;#8217;s a great question! My answer will take the form of an experiment.
First, get a coin. Got it? Great. Now if you&amp;#8217;re Republican, let heads be
&amp;#8220;The Republicans&amp;#8221; and tails be &amp;#8220;The Democrats.&amp;#8221; If you&amp;#8217;re a Democrat,
let heads be &amp;#8220;The Democrats&amp;#8221; and tails be &amp;#8220;The Republicans.&amp;#8221; If you are
neither, then randomly assign a party to heads and allow the other to be
tails. Ready? The coin is to blame. [1] I use this in its original
meaning. That is, the guy whose job it was to do horribly gross things
at a carnival for money, not the guy whose main form of social
interaction is debating scenes in Star Wars on internet forums. A more
up-to-date comparison would have been to say &amp;#8220;for the same reason that
people watch &lt;em&gt;Jersey Shore&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#8221; [2] That is, the budget for the 2011
fiscal year, which started on October 1st 2010. [3] Don&amp;#8217;t worry, all
members of Congress would be exempt from this and would still pick up&amp;nbsp;paychecks!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Corky</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 07 Apr 2011 21:42:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2011-04-07:posts/a-sense-of-scale-in-dollars-and-cents-.html</guid><category>large numbers</category><category>scott bakula</category><category>politics</category></item><item><title>The Law and Large Numbers</title><link>http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/the-law-and-large-numbers.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Human beings are not equipped for dealing with large numbers. Honestly,
7 thousand, 7 million, 7 billion and 7 trillion all register about the
same in my mind, namely 7 big. Unfortunately, there is a world a
different between each of these, three whole orders of magnitude, a
thousand, the difference between lifting me and a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; quarter. This lack
of respect for orders of magnitude has really been rearing its head
recently with most of the political discussions surrounding the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;
budget. Turns out the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Budget is really large. In 2010 it weighed in
at &lt;mathjax&gt;$3.55 trillion. Thats big. Really big. So big that I can't fathom it.
Without getting too political, there has been a site going around
recently; the [You Cut
program](http://republicanwhip.house.gov/YouCut/week13.htm), which
invites public suggestions for cuts to be made to the budget to try and
fix the deficit. Now, personally, I believe we ought to do something
about the deficit. To this end, I think it is useful to point out the
scales involved. In particular, the link I gave above is to one of the
suggested cuts: federal funding of NPR (Disclaimer alert: I love NPR),
which weighs in at 7 million dollars. Seven million dollars is a lot of
money. A lot of money, more than I can imagine having personally. But to
suggest that a 7 million dollar cut is any sort of progress towards
solving a $&lt;/mathjax&gt;1.2 trillion dollar deficit is a little amusing. As a
fraction, this comes out to &lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \frac{ 7 \text{ million} }{ 3.55
\text{ trillion} } = 2 \times 10^{-6} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt; Two parts in a million. To
give a sense of scale to this, the gravitational influence of the moon
on my weight is: &lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \frac{ \frac{ G M_{\text{moon}} }{
R_{\text{earth-moon}}^2 } }{ 10 \text{ m/s}^2 } = 3 \times
10^{-6} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt; Three parts in a million. So, suggesting that you have made
real gains in reducing the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; budget by cutting federal funding for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPR&lt;/span&gt;
is as silly as suggesting that if I want to lose weight, my first
concern should be the current tides. [I want to point out that I don&amp;#8217;t
really mean to get too political, and that I&amp;#8217;ve noticed both parties
pulling these kinds of numbers tricks.] So, wanting to get a little
better understanding of the numbers at stake, I collected some data (all
from the 2010 budget). My goal is to attempt to represent how the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;
government spends its money. Before I begin I need to plug two great
tools towards this end:
&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/02/01/us/budget.html"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; the
NYTimes graphically represents government spending, helping to give a
sense of scale to different categories.
&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/11/13/weekinreview/deficits-graphic.html"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;
the NYTimes lets you try and balance the budget, not only for next year
but down the line, letting you choose from a wide array of proposed
changes. The Data So, below is a list of some of the relevant numbers I
could thing of, and some reference numbers (trillion, billion, million),
as well as the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; debt, and total deficit. In addition to just reporting
the numbers (which you can find anywhere), in the second column I give
the fraction of total spending in scientific&amp;nbsp;units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Name             $               Fraction
  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Debt          13.8 trillion   3.9
  Total Spending   3.55 trillion   1.0
  Budget Deficit   1.17 trillion   3.3E-1
  1 trillion       1 trillion      2.8E-1
  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SS&lt;/span&gt; / Def / &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MM&lt;/span&gt;    730 billion     2.1E-1
  Education        93 billion      2.6E-2
  Taxes (250G+)    54 billion      1.5E-2
  Science          31 billion      8.7E-3
  1 billion        1 billion       2.8E-4
  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPR&lt;/span&gt;              7 million       2.0E-6
  1 million        1 million&amp;nbsp;2.8E-7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SS&lt;/span&gt; / Def / &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MM&lt;/span&gt; means each of Social Security, Defense spending
and Medicare and Medicaid, which each comes in at about the same per
program. We spend 730 billion on each of these. To first glance, these
three programs are how the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; spends money, each of these coming in at
21%. Notice also just how large the deficit is, coming in at 33% of
total spending. The rather cryptic &amp;#8220;Taxes (250G+)&amp;#8221; is how much money
would be saved by letting the Bush tax cuts expire for those making more
than 250,000 a year, a currently hotly debated topic. Notice that it
would only ease the burden by 15%. So this alone would only cut the
budget deficit in half. The above table shows the power of scientific
notation. (Even though I had to use the ugly &amp;#8220;E&amp;#8221; notation). A number
like &amp;#8220;2.8E-4&amp;#8221; is really 2.9 x 10^(-4). But honestly, even a list like
this doesn&amp;#8217;t really make an impact for me. So, I thought of a couple
other ways to represent the same numbers, scaling them to some &amp;#8216;big&amp;#8217;
things I can conceive&amp;nbsp;of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Barry&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;Budget&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this might not be a fair comparison, but let&amp;#8217;s scale down the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;
budget to sizes that a person can understand. By scaling by a factor of
$100 million, we end up with the story of my friend&amp;nbsp;Barry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Name             &lt;mathjax&gt;$               Fraction   Barry
  US Debt          13.8 trillion   3.9        $&lt;/mathjax&gt;138,495.50
  Total Spending   3.55 trillion   1.0        &lt;mathjax&gt;$35,500.00
  Budget Deficit   1.17 trillion   3.3E-1     $&lt;/mathjax&gt;11,690.0
  1 trillion       1 trillion      2.8E-1     &lt;mathjax&gt;$10,000.00
  SS / Def / MM    730 billion     2.1E-1     $&lt;/mathjax&gt;7,296.67
  Education        93 billion      2.6E-2     &lt;mathjax&gt;$930.00
  Taxes (250G+)    54 billion      1.5E-2     $&lt;/mathjax&gt;540.00
  Science          31 billion      8.7E-3     &lt;mathjax&gt;$310.00
  1 billion        1 billion       2.8E-4     $&lt;/mathjax&gt;10.00
  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPR&lt;/span&gt;              7 million       2.0E-6     &lt;mathjax&gt;$0.07
  1 million        1 million       2.8E-7     $&lt;/mathjax&gt;0.01&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you&amp;#8217;ll notice, Barry makes &lt;mathjax&gt;$23,810.00 a year (total receipts)[he's a
grad student], but spends $&lt;/mathjax&gt;35,500 a year. This has created his current
debt problem. Barry has &lt;mathjax&gt;$138,495 in credit card debt, and still
overspends by $&lt;/mathjax&gt;11,690 a year. How does Barry spend his money? Well,
every year Barry buys some &lt;mathjax&gt;$7,300 in guns, spends another $&lt;/mathjax&gt;14,600 mostly
taking care of his grandma. He pays a tuition of &lt;mathjax&gt;$930 a year at school,
and $&lt;/mathjax&gt;310 on science books. Every year he donates 7 cents to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPR&lt;/span&gt;. Every
million &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; dollars is 1 penny in Barry&amp;nbsp;dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Work&amp;nbsp;Week&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That might not have been fair. This time, lets scale the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; government
spending to a work week of 40 hours. I think a work week is a large
amount of time that I still have a real grasp&amp;nbsp;for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Name             $               Work Time      Guess at time
  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Debt          13.8 trillion   156 hours      Work month
  Total Spending   3.55 trillion   40 hours       Work week
  Budget Deficit   1.17 trillion   13 hours       All Mon and Tue morn
  1 trillion       1 trillion      11.3 hours     two days of good work
  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SS&lt;/span&gt; / Def / &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MM&lt;/span&gt;    730 billion     8.2 hour       true work in a day
  Education        93 billion      63 minutes     lunch break
  Taxes (250G+)    54 billion      36 minutes     cooler chat
  Science          31 billion      21 minutes     Show on Hulu
  1 billion        1 billion       40 seconds     Stretching at desk
  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPR&lt;/span&gt;              7 million       0.3 seconds    mouse click
  1 million        1 million       0.04 seconds&amp;nbsp;blink&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cross&amp;nbsp;Country&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now lets scale to a distance. The longest drive I&amp;#8217;ve ever done is from
Los Angeles, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CA&lt;/span&gt; to Orlando, Fl, which was 2511 miles. In terms of this
scale, the budget breaks down&amp;nbsp;as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Name             $               Dist    &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Debt          13.8 trillion   9796 mi   &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NY&lt;/span&gt; - Sydney
  Total Spending   3.55 trillion   2511 mi   &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LA&lt;/span&gt; - Orlando
  Budget Deficit   1.17 trillion   827 mi    Texas
  1 trillion       1 trillion      707 mi  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SS&lt;/span&gt; / Def / &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MM&lt;/span&gt;    730 billion     516 mi    Orlando - Mobile
  Education        93 billion      66 mi   &lt;br /&gt;
  Taxes (250G+)    54 billion      38 mi   &lt;br /&gt;
  Science          31 billion      22 mi     Cross town
  1 billion        1 billion       0.7 mi    14 blocks
  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPR&lt;/span&gt;              7 million       9 yards &lt;br /&gt;
  1 million        1 million       4&amp;nbsp;feet    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(So I just want to point out again, claiming that cutting &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPR&lt;/span&gt; funding
makes a dent in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; budget is similar to claiming you&amp;#8217;ve moved closer
to Orlando (while in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LA&lt;/span&gt;) by crossing the&amp;nbsp;room.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Lesson&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, without getting too political&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;d just like to point out that if
our politicians are serious about solving the budget crisis, they need
to stop talking about million dollar programs, and start taking about
100 billion dollar ones. The problem is that it&amp;#8217;s hard to either slash
funding for large programs like defense, or social security, and it&amp;#8217;s
even harder raise taxes (really at all). But if we never consider those
options, we&amp;#8217;re never going to get out of the rut. In my undergraduate
physics lab, the instructor had a mantra: &amp;#8220;A number without context is
meaningless&amp;#8221;. Now, he originally meant the statement to be a lesson on
how important it is to quote errors on your measurements, but I think I
can adapt it to apply to giving out numbers like 7 billion without a
sense of&amp;nbsp;scale.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Alemi</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2010 22:34:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2010-12-09:posts/the-law-and-large-numbers.html</guid><category>large numbers</category><category>budget</category><category>politics</category></item></channel></rss>
