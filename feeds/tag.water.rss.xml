&lt;p&gt;Apologies for the hiatus recently, it&amp;#8217;s been a busy time (when isn&amp;#8217;t it).  I hope to get back to talking about experiments soon, but for now I wanted to write up a quick problem I thought up a while back.  The question is this: how long does a molecule of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;H2O&lt;/span&gt; on earth remain in the liquid state, on&amp;nbsp;average?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I&amp;#8217;m going to treat this purely as an order of magnitude problem.  I&amp;#8217;m also going to have to start with one assumption that is almost certainly inaccurate, but makes things a lot easier.  I&amp;#8217;m going to assume perfect mixing of all of the water on&amp;nbsp;earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that assumption, I really only need to figure out two things.  The first is how much liquid water there is on earth.  The second is now much liquid water leaves the liquid phase each year.  Let&amp;#8217;s start with the total amount of liquid water on earth.  This is relatively easy to estimate.  I happen to know that about 70% of the earth&amp;#8217;s surface is covered in water.  Most all of that is ocean.  To an order of magnitude, the average depth of the ocean must be 1 km, as it is certainly not 100 m or 10 km [1].  For a thin spherically shell, the volume of the shell is&amp;nbsp;roughly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ 4 \pi r_e^2 \Delta r $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where r_e is the radius of the earth.  Thus, the total volume of water on the earth&amp;nbsp;is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$.7*4 \pi r_e^2 (1 km)$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we need to figure out how much H20 leaves the liquid phase every year.  To an order of magnitude, it rains 1 m everywhere on earth each year, it&amp;#8217;s not .1 m or 10 m [2].  I&amp;#8217;m going to ignore any freezing/melting in the ice caps, assuming that is small fraction of the water that leaves the liquid phase each year.  Since we have a closed system, all the water that rains must have left the liquid phase.  So, on average, the total volume of water that leaves the liquid phase&amp;nbsp;is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$4 \pi r_e^2 (1 m) $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the fraction of liquid water that changes phase per year&amp;nbsp;is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \frac{4 \pi r_e^2 (1m)}{.7*4\pi r_e^2 (1 km)} = .0014 $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that, given my assumption of perfect mixing,  in somewhere around 1/.0014 = 700 yr all of the water on earth will have cycled through the vapor phase.  Since we&amp;#8217;re only operating to an order of magnitude, I&amp;#8217;ll call this 1000 years.  This is the answer to our question if every molecule has been in the vapor phase once in 1000 years, then we expect a molecule to stay in the liquid phase for 1000&amp;nbsp;years&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] According to wikipedia, this is really about 4 km, so we&amp;#8217;re underestimating a&amp;nbsp;bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2] According to wikipedia, this is spot on (.99 m on&amp;nbsp;average).&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jesse</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 10 Jul 2011 22:07:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2011-07-10:posts/lifetime-of-liquid-water.html</guid><category>order of magnitude</category><category>fun</category><category>water</category><category>physics</category></item><item><title>Falling water - hot or cold?</title><link>http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/falling-water-hot-or-cold-.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone!  Since this is my first post as one of the virtuosi, I should probably introduce myself a little.  I&amp;#8217;m a first year graduate student in physics at Cornell university.  I did my undergraduate work at Oberlin college (I know, you&amp;#8217;ve never heard of it), and I&amp;#8217;m currently just trying to keep my head above water and take in as much physics as I can.  Additionally, I&amp;#8217;m trying to find work for the summer, I might post more on that&amp;nbsp;later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the question that is on my mind is: How much does a water droplet heat up when it goes over niagara falls?
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_SYZpxZOlcb0/S70wftXc-QI/AAAAAAAAAAM/ytO82-q8Rio/s1600/Aerial+View+of+Niagara+Falls,+Ontario,+Canada.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_SYZpxZOlcb0/S70wftXc-QI/AAAAAAAAAAM/ytO82-q8Rio/s320/Aerial+View+of+Niagara+Falls,+Ontario,+Canada.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;(image from http://grandcanyon.free.fr/)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s begin with a little motivation.  Why would a water droplet heat up when it falls?  Well, the physical mechanism is that as it falls through air, air resistance dissipates energy.  This energy is dissipated mostly as heat, so we expect to put some additional heat into our water droplet as it&amp;nbsp;falls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More quantitatively, assume the water is going to fall from some height h to the ground.  The gravitational potential energy of our water droplet is given by
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ PE=mgh $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
where m is the mass of the droplet and g is acceleration due to gravity.  We assume that the particle starts with no initial velocity.  It is very easy to place an upper bound on how much the droplet will warm.  The maximum heating will happen if all of the potential energy were converted to thermal energy.  The temperature change wound be
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ mc\Delta T = mgh $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
so
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \Delta T = \frac{gh}{c} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
Where c is the specific heat of&amp;nbsp;water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Niagara falls is 51m tall, g is 9.8m/s&lt;em&gt;s and c is 4.1kJ/kg&lt;/em&gt;K so this gives a maximum temperature change of .12C=.22F, fractions of a&amp;nbsp;degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we can do better than this.
&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
A small droplet will experience a linear drag force, and a bouyant force from the air.  The combination of these will result in a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes%27_law"&gt;terminal velocity&lt;/a&gt; of
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ v_t=\frac{2}{9}\frac{(\rho_p-\rho_f)}{\mu} g R^2 $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
Where &lt;mathjax&gt;$\rho_p \text{ and } \rho_f$&lt;/mathjax&gt; are the droplet and air density respectively, &lt;mathjax&gt;$\mu$&lt;/mathjax&gt; is the dynamic viscosity and R is the radius.  This gives the kinetic energy the particle gains and we assume the rest of the potential energy goes to thermal energy.  So,
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$mc\Delta T = mgh-\tfrac{1}{2}mv_t^2$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$\Delta T = \frac{gh-v_t^2}{c} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can plug in some numbers.  A little bit of searching will turn up appropriate values for the density of water (~1000kg/m^3), the density of air (~1.2kg/m^3) and the dynamic viscosity of air (~.8mPa*s).  We estimate the radius of a small droplet of water is 1.5mm (~1/16&amp;#8221;), which seems about a medium sized raindrop.  This gives a terminal velocity of 6m/s.  Using the above equation this gives a temperature change of
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \Delta T = .0024C/m*h-.009C $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like our calculation only makes sense after the after droplet has fallen more than 4.5m (this is probably about the distance it takes to reach terminal velocity)!  Niagara falls is 51m tall, so this gives a change in temperature of .11C=.2F.  The water only heats up by a fraction of a degree.  This more realistic estimate is still rather close to our upper&amp;nbsp;bound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I leave it as a question to you, the reader, to estimate the temperature change of a typical&amp;nbsp;raindrop.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jesse</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 07 Apr 2010 19:25:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2010-04-07:posts/falling-water-hot-or-cold-.html</guid><category>niagara falls</category><category>heat</category><category>water</category></item></channel></rss>
