Recently I've been playing around with one such data set: images from the &lt;a href="http://aviris.jpl.nasa.gov/"&gt;Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;I've always found it interesting that the way we perceive color is very different from how light actually works.  Most of us have three different types of cones in our eyes and we perceive different colors as different combinations of stimuli to these three types of cones.  In a very rough sense, when we look at a color, our brain gets three different numbers to figure out what it is. Light, on the other hand, is a bunch of photons with some distribution of wavelengths.  To fully describe the light coming from an object you need a function that shows how many photons are at any given wavelength, which is way more complicated than just the three numbers we get.   &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;So what about all that information that gets thrown away on the way to our brain?  Are we missing out on a magical world of super-duper colors and wonder?  Not really, but skip past the break anyways to find out more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;There are a few things our eyes have a hard time distinguishing.  For example, take a look at this picture of a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium-vapor_lamp#Low_pressure_sodium"&gt;low-pressure sodium lamp&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:LPS_Lamp_35W_running.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 93px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_f2jEPVoC9C4/TUx02kW16bI/AAAAAAAABI0/vonaPzNiAag/s320/LPS_Lamp_35W_running.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5569955319971703218" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;If you've ever been in a sketchy parking lot at night or an intro physics class you've probably seen one of these in real life.  It looks just like the picture right?  It does to us, but the light coming from the picture and the light from the real lamp are totally different.  All the photons from the real lamp have wavelengths very close to 589 nanometers, while the ones coming from the picture on your screen have a bunch of different wavelengths ranging from 500 to 700 nanometers, depending on what type of monitor you have.  (It's easy to &lt;a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7Ezhuxj/astro/html/spectrometer.html"&gt;build your own spectrometer&lt;/a&gt; and see this for yourself.) &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?gl=us&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=37.432068,-122.017937&amp;amp;spn=0.196834,0.308647&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=12"&gt;&lt;img style="float: right; margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; cursor: pointer; width: 174px; height: 400px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_f2jEPVoC9C4/TUx1kWr0ZpI/AAAAAAAABI8/K7RQ-Qzxa50/s400/Moffett%2BField%2BCrop.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5569956106575570578" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is an extreme example since there are few objects that emit purely monochromatic light.  What do normal objects look like spectroscopically?  I wanted to find out, but unfortunately there's not too many freely-available spectroscopic images of everyday objects floating around the internet, and my attempts to make my own were stymied by the fact that no one wanted to let me borrow $20,000 worth of optical bandpass filters.  However, there are a several orbital satellites and planes which take spectroscopic images of the earth, and one of them, AVIRIS, has a few sample data sets for people to play around with.  I recently wrote some code to help me look at one data set in particular – a spectroscopic image of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moffett_Federal_Airfield"&gt;Moffett Federal Airfield&lt;/a&gt; in California, shown here in a normal picture from Google Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;AVIRIS acts much like a normal camera, but instead of three wide-band filters for distinguishing color it uses 225 narrow bands ranging from 366 nanometers (near UV) to 2500 nanometers (near IR).  Any of these bands can be thought of as a single monochromatic image.  Here I have plotted two bands side by side for comparison.  The right image is at 463 nanometers (a nice blue color) and the other is at 2268 nanometers, well into the infrared.  (Both images are false-colored to enhance the contrast).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_f2jEPVoC9C4/TUx2M29FDwI/AAAAAAAABJE/lSUTxxI4ZFw/s1600/Img10and200withInsets.png"&gt;&lt;img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 355px; height: 400px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_f2jEPVoC9C4/TUx2M29FDwI/AAAAAAAABJE/lSUTxxI4ZFw/s400/Img10and200withInsets.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5569956802432667394" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;The scene looks a lot different at the two different wavelengths.  In the first image there's one area that's particularly bright – it is one of several settling ponds belonging to a Morton Salt factory, although I have no idea what is special about this one that makes it reflect blue light so strongly.  The second image highlights different features and clearly shows the difference between the moving water in the creeks and the standing water in the bay.   &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;These are just two of the bands, but you can see all of them fly by in the movie below.  (Note that the color scale is set for each band individually, which is why there sometimes seems to be a large change between adjacent bands).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;object width="320" height="266" class="BLOG_video_class" id="BLOG_video-18b5070271fced2c" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="//www.youtube.com/get_player"&gt;&lt;param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF"&gt;&lt;param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;param name="flashvars" value="flvurl=http://redirector.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?id%3D18b5070271fced2c%26itag%3D5%26source%3Dblogger%26app%3Dblogger%26cmo%3Dsensitive_content%253Dyes%26ip%3D0.0.0.0%26ipbits%3D0%26expire%3D1363446061%26sparams%3Did,itag,source,ip,ipbits,expire%26signature%3D951BC27C2F6B93FC5072D1041B70CEB356D764BC.25AA41756A876C1A766E7BECD2E9A86223B7525%26key%3Dck2&amp;amp;iurl=http://video.google.com/ThumbnailServer2?app%3Dblogger%26contentid%3D18b5070271fced2c%26offsetms%3D5000%26itag%3Dw160%26sigh%3D5MqHW2I4EkMoGsDlHtPtXnDjfvc&amp;amp;autoplay=0&amp;amp;ps=blogger"&gt;&lt;embed src="//www.youtube.com/get_player" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="320" height="266" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" flashvars="flvurl=http://redirector.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?id%3D18b5070271fced2c%26itag%3D5%26source%3Dblogger%26app%3Dblogger%26cmo%3Dsensitive_content%253Dyes%26ip%3D0.0.0.0%26ipbits%3D0%26expire%3D1363446061%26sparams%3Did,itag,source,ip,ipbits,expire%26signature%3D951BC27C2F6B93FC5072D1041B70CEB356D764BC.25AA41756A876C1A766E7BECD2E9A86223B7525%26key%3Dck2&amp;iurl=http://video.google.com/ThumbnailServer2?app%3Dblogger%26contentid%3D18b5070271fced2c%26offsetms%3D5000%26itag%3Dw160%26sigh%3D5MqHW2I4EkMoGsDlHtPtXnDjfvc&amp;autoplay=0&amp;ps=blogger" allowFullScreen="true" /&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;If you agree with me that the embedded video looks super-crappy you can &lt;a href="http://gotfork.net/virtuosi/VariableGain.avi"&gt;download the original here&lt;/a&gt; (6.4 MB).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;One of the things that struck me about this video is that it seems like much of the image doesn't change too much through the whole visual range.  Not surprisingly, it's a lot easier for us to distinguish between the slight differences in color in a normal image than it is for us to distinguish between the slight changes of intensity here.
&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;So what do the spectra of individual points in the image look like?  Let's focus on a few easily-identifiable objects.  (I'll talk about how I made the roughly-true color image below in a later post).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_f2jEPVoC9C4/TUx7dCumIAI/AAAAAAAABJk/9b8gXeMkqg4/s1600/FiveLocMapCombo.png"&gt;&lt;img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 308px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_f2jEPVoC9C4/TUx7dCumIAI/AAAAAAAABJk/9b8gXeMkqg4/s400/FiveLocMapCombo.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5569962578029191170" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;The first thing that stands out is that there's a lot of features that are common to all of the locations, such as the big gap near 1750 nanometers.  While the sun sends photons with a distribution of wavelengths roughly described by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law"&gt;Planck's Law&lt;/a&gt;, certain wavelengths are strongly absorbed by gasses in the atmosphere as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Solar_Spectrum.png"&gt;&lt;img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 380px; height: 282px;" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Solar_Spectrum.png" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;Looking at the different spectra we can see that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_absorption_by_water"&gt;liquid water absorbs strongly in the infrared&lt;/a&gt;, and the green grass on the golf course reflects strongly in the near-infrared (no clue why).  There is also a clear difference in intensities for each of the locations in the visual range, but the five locations otherwise look quite similar, even though they are very different colors in real life.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;I'll look at a few more interesting things in this data set and talk a bit about about how our eyes and brains process color in a later post.

I started during my sophomore year in college, went straight to graduate school, and continued here (albeit not quite immediately).  There are people out there who have been doing this for a lot longer than I have, but I've gained a few insights, by working with said people, and through my own experiences in the lab.  I thought I'd try to share a few of these, to help illuminate the past few days I blogged about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;Something Always Goes Wrong&lt;/b&gt;
It's the nature of experimental science.  Something always goes wrong.  It might be your equipment, it might be your sample, hell, it might be something personal.  But something will go wrong.  Wednesday was a prime example.  Not only did I get soaked by rain and temporarily lose my bike lock, but it took us 9 hours to really start taking data due to equipment problems.  I think this is endemic in what we're doing.  We're trying to investigate something that no one has ever done (at least not quite exactly what we're doing).  This means that we're usually pushing the bounds of our equipment and setup.  Not just that, but most of the equipment is exceedingly complex, giving it many more places it can break down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It's An Emotional Roller Coaster&lt;/b&gt;
Sometimes nothing works.  At all.  You try and try and you just can't make it work.  Then sometimes everything is going well.  You're getting data, and not just that, but the data looks good.  Whether it's confirming or destroying your expectations, you're finding out something new about the world.  It's exciting.  You find something interesting and start chasing it.  However, you have to be careful.  Often the result is not what you think you're seeing.  It's a false signal from your equipment, or attributable to the background material doing something strange.  Or you've destroyed the sample, and that's why it's  not doing what you expect.  You go up and down quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It's Exhausting&lt;/b&gt;
Part of it is the long hours.  But really, 16 hour days are not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; bad.  Sleeping 6.5-7 hours.  I can usually do that, no problem.  So what's different when it's research?  You have to be thinking all the time.  For 16 hours.  In general, you can't just push the button and wait.  You need to look at the data while it comes in, to determine what data to take next.  Combine that with the emotional up and down . . . even though you're not necessarily physically exhausted, you're mentally worn out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You Get More Questions Than Answers&lt;/b&gt;
My undergraduate advisor would always say that when you're doing research you generate three questions for every question you answer.  That's more or less true.  It is very rare to go out and answer all the questions you have.  It is even more rare to not get more questions.    There's always more to learn.  In many ways, that's great, though a little frustrating.  If we ran out of questions, we'd probably run out of a job.  But there's always another twist that you didn't expect nature to have, something else surprising you.  That's why we do it.  There's no finality in research.  We can't get all the answers, ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of our time isn't data taking, but making/setting up our equipment, analyzing data, and such things.  Still, I hope that this series of posts has given you a taste of what we scientists may do when we're taking data.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="reflection"></category><category term="CHESS"></category><category term="experiment"></category></entry></feed>
