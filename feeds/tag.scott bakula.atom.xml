&lt;p&gt;In less than two days, NASA's Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) / &lt;i&gt;Curiosity&lt;/i&gt; rover will begin its harrowing descent to the Martian surface.  If everything goes according to the kind-of-crazy-what-the-heck-is-a-sky-crane plan, this process will be referred to as "landing" (otherwise, more crashy/explodey gerunds will no doubt be used). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSL mission is run through NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory where, by coincidence, I happen to be at the moment.  Now, I'm not working on this project, so I don't have a lot to add that &lt;a href="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/index.cfm"&gt;isn't&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2012/08/02/curiositys-chem-lab-on-mars/"&gt;available&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2012/07/20/43-years-later-were-seven-minutes-away-from-a-second-great-step-forward/"&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;.  BUT I do feel an authority-by-proximity kind of fallacy kicking in, so how about a post why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Preliminaries&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;Before we get started, I feel obligated to link to NASA's &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ki_Af_o9Q9s"&gt;Seven Minutes of Terror&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;video.  If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend watching it right now (my favorite part is the subtitles).  It has over a million views on YouTube and seems to have done a pretty good job at generating interest in the mission.  Although, it's a shame they had to interview the first guy in what appears to be a police interrogation room.  Oh well.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;About the Rover&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;This thing is &lt;i&gt;big&lt;/i&gt;.  It's the size of a car and is jam-packed with &lt;a href="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/mission/instruments/"&gt;scientific equipment&lt;/a&gt;.  There's a couple different spectrometers, a bunch of cameras, a drill for collecting rock samples, and radiation detectors.  Probably the coolest instrument onboard &lt;i&gt;Curiosity&lt;/i&gt; is called the ChemCam.  The ChemCam uses a laser to vaporize small regions of rock, which allows it to study the composition of things about 20 feet away.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In addition to the scientific payload, &lt;i&gt;Curiosity&lt;/i&gt; also needs some way to generate power.  Previous rovers had been powered by solar panels, but there don't appear to be any here.  Instead, &lt;i&gt;Curiosity&lt;/i&gt; is &lt;a href="http://www.ne.doe.gov/pdfFiles/MMRTG_Jan2008.pdf"&gt;powered&lt;/a&gt; by the heat released from the radioactive decay of about 10 pounds of plutonium dioxide.  This source will power the rover for &lt;strike&gt;about a Martian year&lt;/strike&gt; well beyond the currently planned mission duration of one Martian year (about 687 Earth days)  &lt;i&gt;[Thanks to Nathan in the comments for pointing this out!]&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;To summarize, the rover is a nuclear-powered lab-on-wheels that &lt;i&gt;shoots lasers out of its head&lt;/i&gt;.  This is pretty cool.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jLOpoGLY6Yk/UBzbYgwRMKI/AAAAAAAAAZg/lViBtW_vQgM/s1600/msl2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="265" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jLOpoGLY6Yk/UBzbYgwRMKI/AAAAAAAAAZg/lViBtW_vQgM/s400/msl2.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;In non-SI units, the MSL is roughly one handsome man (1 hm) tall&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A Curious Footprint&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;There's been a lot of preparation at JPL this week for the upcoming landing.  All the shiny rover models have been taken out of the visitor's center and put in a tent outside, presumably so there will be a pretty backdrop for press reports and the like. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Anyway, I was out taking pictures of the rovers at the end of the day today when someone pointed out something cool about the tires on &lt;i&gt;Curiosity&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Here's a close-up:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZAritHZ1usE/UBzfOUrM_oI/AAAAAAAAAZ0/meA5wgE6HCM/s1600/MSL_tire.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="266" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZAritHZ1usE/UBzfOUrM_oI/AAAAAAAAAZ0/meA5wgE6HCM/s400/MSL_tire.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Hole-y Tires&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;Each tire on the rover is has "JPL" punched out in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:International_Morse_Code.svg"&gt;Morse code&lt;/a&gt;!  Makes sense, though.  If you're going to spend $2.5 billion on something, you might as well put your name on it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Watch the Landing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you want to watch the landing, check out the &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/index.html"&gt;NASA TV stream&lt;/a&gt;.  The landing is scheduled for Sunday night at 10:31 pm PDT (1:31 am EDT).  Until then, it looks like they are showing a lot of interviews and other cool behind-the-scenes kind of stuff.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="mars"></category><category term="curiosity"></category><category term="MSL"></category><category term="scott bakula"></category></entry><entry><title>Tales from the Transit of Venus</title><link href="http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/tales-from-the-transit-of-venus.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-06-05T00:50:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Corky</name></author><id>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2012-06-05:posts/tales-from-the-transit-of-venus.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JNVfkJwnAyY/T81XzasS8iI/AAAAAAAAAYU/eCerOIwvHxA/s1600/sad_transit.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="199" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JNVfkJwnAyY/T81XzasS8iI/AAAAAAAAAYU/eCerOIwvHxA/s200/sad_transit.png" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Sad Old Sun&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is the transit of Venus, which, aside from being a totally rad astronomical event, is also the perfect excuse to tell my favorite story of an unlucky Frenchman (I have many). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is by no means new and, if you've ever taken an astronomy course, you've probably already heard it.  It is perhaps the closest thing Astronomy has to a ghost story, told though the glow of a flashlight on moonless nights to scare the children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the story of Guillaume Le Gentil, a dude that just couldn't catch a break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: white; line-height: 19px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: white; line-height: 19px;"&gt;------&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: white; line-height: 19px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: white; line-height: 19px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;Guillaume Joseph Hyacinthe Jean-Baptiste Le Gentil de la Galaisière was a Frenchman with an incredibly long name.  He was also an astronomer, though he hadn't started out that way.  Monsieur Le Gentil (as his friends called him and so, then, shall we) had originally intended to enter the priesthood.  However, he soon began sneaking away to hear astronomy lectures and quickly switched from studies of Heaven to those heavens more readily observed in a telescope.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: white; line-height: 19px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: white; line-height: 19px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;Le Gentil happened to get into the astronomy game at a very exciting time.  The next pair of Venus transits was imminent and astronomers were giddy with anticipation.  Though the previous transit of 1639 had been predicted, it was met with little fanfare and only a few measurements.  But the transits of 1761 and 1769 would be different.  People would be ready.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: white; line-height: 19px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: white; line-height: 19px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;And the stakes were higher this time, too.  Soon after the 1639 transit, Edmund Halley (he of the-only-comet-people-can-name fame) calculated that with enough simultaneous measurements, the distance from the Earth to the Sun (the so-called astronomical unit, or AU) could be measured fairly accurately.  Since almost all other astronomical distances were known in terms of the AU, knowing its precise value would essentially set the scale for the cosmos.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;Brand new telescopes in hand, the astronomers of Europe set sail for locations all over the world.  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;Le Gentil had been assigned to observe the transit from Pondicherry, a French holding on the eastern side of India.  On March 26th, 1760, he began his long sea voyage around the Cape of Good Hope towards India.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;The voyage from France to India was a bit too long for the ship Le Gentil hitched a ride on and he only made it as far as Mauritius (a small island off Madagascar).  Dropped off with all his equipment, Le Gentil was left waiting for any ship at all to take him to Pondicherry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;Perhaps it was the Curse of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodo"&gt;Dodo&lt;/a&gt; or perhaps it was just bad luck, but while he was waiting, Le Gentil learned that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Years'_War"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; had broken out between the French and the British, making a trip to British India very difficult for a Frenchman.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;Then the monsoon season started, meaning that even if he could find a ship, it would have to take a much longer route to India than initially planned and that it would be very difficult to make the journey before the transit occurred.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;Then, he caught dysentery for the first time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;Finally, after months of waiting, Le Gentil (barely recovered from his illness) left Mauritius for India in February of 1761.  Though time appeared to be running out, the captain of the ship he was on promised he would be there to observe the transit in June.  About halfway to India, the winds switched directions and the ship was forced to turn back to Mauritius.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;Le Gentil dutifully observed the transit of Venus in 1761 from a rocky ship in the middle of the Indian Ocean.  The data were useless and he never attempted any analysis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;Although he missed the first transit, these things come in pairs separated by eight years.  There was still another chance.  And with all this time to prepare, there was no way he was going to miss the second one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;In fact, there was a bit &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;too much&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt; time.  But as a world-traveling 18th century man of science, Le Gentil had plenty of other interests to fill his days.  He was particularly interested in surveying the region around Madagascar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;So he made a really nice map of Madagascar.  And then he ate some bad kind of some kind of animal and came down with a terrible sickness.  He describes this illness and its "cure" in his journals:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;This sickness was a sort of violent stroke, of which several very copious blood-lettings made immediately &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;on my arm and my &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;foot, and emetic administered twelve hours afterwards, rid &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;me of it quite quickly.  But there remained for seven or eight &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;days in my optic nerve a singular impression from this sickness; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;it was to see two objects in the place of one, beside each other; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;this illusion disappeared little by little as I regained &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;my strength...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;After recovering from both his sickness and the treatment, Le Gentil decided to begin his preparations for the 1769 transit of Venus.  He calculated that either Manila or the Mariana Islands would be the ideal spot to observe.  The Sun would be relatively high in the sky at both places when Venus passed by, meaning that the view would be through less atmosphere with a reduced chance of clouds passing through the line of sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le Gentil packed up his stuff and headed off to Manila, where he could catch another ship to get to the Mariana Islands.  Arriving in Manila in 1766, the astronomer found himself exhausted from months of sickness and sea-voyage.  So, when he was offered passage on a ship heading to the Mariana Islands, he quickly declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That he chose not to depart Manila at that time was perhaps his one stroke of good luck in the entire journey.  The ship sunk.  Writing in his journal, Le Gentil appears to have developed that particular sense of humor that generally accompanies constant disappointment:
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is true that only three or four people were drowned, those who were the most eager to save themselves, which is what almost always happens in shipwrecks.  I cannot answer that I would not have increased the number of persons eager to save themselves.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In any case, Le Gentil was in Manila with plenty of time to prepare for the next transit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the astronomer may have over-prepared.  Having arrived three years before the event, he now had three years to worry and second-guess his decision.  It didn't help that the Spanish governor of Manila was kind of a crazy person.  Not wanting to miss the observation of a lifetime owing to the whims of mildly insane strong man, Le Gentil packed up his stuff and headed to Pondicherry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally in Pondicherry, Le Gentil worked tirelessly to construct his observatory and make plenty of astronomical observations in preparation for the event.  He had state of the art equipment and had fully calibrated and double checked everything.  It was now nine years since his journey began and only a few days until the transit was scheduled to occur at sunrise on June 4th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire month of May was beautiful weather and pristine observing conditions, as were the first few days of June.  Le Gentil likely went to bed on the 3rd of June fully confident that the next morning would be no different. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He woke up early in the morning to begin preparations for his sunrise observations only to find clouds on the horizon.  The clouds remained, obscuring the sun, all through the duration of the transit.  A few hours after the end of the transit, the sun broke through the clouds and remained visible for the rest of the day.  Le Gentil had missed his second transit in Pondicherry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He sums it up in his journal:
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;That is the fate which often awaits astronomers.  I had gone more than ten thousand leagues; it seemed that I had crossed such a great expanse of seas, exiling myself from my native land, only to be the spectator of a fatal cloud which came to place itself before the sun at the precise moment of my observation, to carry off from me the fruits of my pains and of my fatigues&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In Manila, the Sun rose in perfectly clear skies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distraught, Le Gentil remained in bed for some weeks afterward.  He soon caught a fever and missed the ship that was supposed to take him home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He recovered, but then came down with dysentery again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barely recovered from his various illnesses, he managed to get a ride back to Mauritius.  He caught a ship leaving the island in November of 1770.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ship was struck by a hurricane and almost completely destroyed.  It managed to limp back to Mauritius. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second attempt proved more successful and Le Gentil finally "set foot on France at nine o'clock in the morning, after eleven years, six months and thirteen days of absence."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though he had finally made it home, he was not out of the woods quite yet.  In his absence, Le Gentil's heirs had tried to declare him dead to gain their inheritance, his accountant had mishandled (and lost) a large chunk of his holdings, and the Academy of Sciences, which had sent him on his 11 year mission, had given his seat to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not quite the welcome home he had hoped for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite his seemingly never-ending misfortune, things did turn around for Le Gentil.  He married, had a daughter, and was reinstated into the Academy of Sciences.  Presumably, he lived out the rest of his days in relative happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le Gentil died in 1792.  Keeping true to his style, this man who missed two of the most important astronomical events of his time fortunately managed to also miss the most important (and violent) &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reign_of_Terror"&gt;political event&lt;/a&gt; of his time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: white; line-height: 19px;"&gt;------&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: white; line-height: 19px;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: white; line-height: 19px;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: white; line-height: 19px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;References:  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: white; line-height: 19px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;I have mainly used a very nice series of historical papers of Le Gentil's misadventures with the transit of Venus written by Helen Sawyer Hogg.  The papers were originally published in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: white;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt; and can be accessed through NASA's ADS ( &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1951JRASC..45...37S" style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1951JRASC..45...89S" style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1951JRASC..45..127S" style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;Part 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1951JRASC..45..173S" style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;Part 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: white; line-height: 19px;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: white; line-height: 19px;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: white; line-height: 19px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;More Transit of Venus:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: white; line-height: 19px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

(Image from Wikipedia)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not typically interested in lotteries.  They seem silly and I am seriously beginning to question their usefulness in bringing about a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lottery"&gt;good harvest&lt;/a&gt;.  But this morning I read in the news that the Mega Millions lottery currently has a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Millions#Record_jackpots_.28listed_by_cash_value.29"&gt;world record&lt;/a&gt; jackpot up for grabs.  In fact, the jackpot is so big...
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;Tonight Show Audience:  &lt;i&gt;HOW BIG IS IT?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It is &lt;i&gt;so big&lt;/i&gt; that I decided to do a little bit of analysis on the expected returns.  Zing!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Some Background&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
First, a little background.  The Mega Millions lottery is an aptly named lottery in which numbered ping pong balls are pulled from a giant rotating tub of randomization.  Five of these are drawn from one tub of 56 balls, with no replacement.  The sixth ball (the so-called "Mega Ball") is drawn from a &lt;i&gt;separate &lt;/i&gt;tub of 46 balls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To play, one picks 5 different numbers (1-56) for the regular draws and one number (1-46) for the Mega Ball.  The first five can match in any order, but the last ball has to match with the Mega Ball.  Prizes are given out based on how many numbers you match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stolen from the Mega Millions website, the prizes and odds are given in the table below.  The current jackpot is listed at &lt;mathjax&gt;$500 million (if taken in annuity) or $&lt;/mathjax&gt;359 million if taken in an up-front lump sum.  It costs $1 dollar to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Zi3rSfNqtuI/T3PHTEaXmvI/AAAAAAAAAXE/y9Hs7fqWrgs/s1600/crummy_table.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="297" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Zi3rSfNqtuI/T3PHTEaXmvI/AAAAAAAAAXE/y9Hs7fqWrgs/s320/crummy_table.gif" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Don't worry about the asterisk.  It just says CA is lame.

&lt;p&gt;Hot diggity daffodil, we're ready to get going!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Expected Winnings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Alright, so it costs $1 to play and we could potentially win $500 million.  It sure &lt;i&gt;feels&lt;/i&gt; like it is worth it to play (what's the harm?).  But we can do better than feelings, we have... MATH!&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Since we have an exhaustive list of outcomes and their probabilities (which is just the inverse of the big number in the "chances" column), we can calculate the expectation value for our winnings.  The expectation value is just the sum over all the possible prize values times the probability of winning that prize.  In other words,&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;$$\langle W \rangle = \sum_i W_i \times p_i, $$&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;where we denote our expected winnings in angled brackets. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;In essence, this value represents the average prize you would win if you played this lottery over and over and over again (or played all the combinations of numbers).  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Setting the jackpot to $500 million, we can now compute the expected winnings as&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;$$ \langle W \rangle = \frac{\$ 500,000,000}{175,711,536} + \frac{\$ 250,000}{3,904,701} +\frac{\$ 10,000}{689,065} + \frac{\$ 150}{15,313} + \frac{\$ 150}{13,781} $$&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;$$+ \frac{\$ 10}{844} + \frac{\$ 7}{306} + \frac{\$ 3}{141} + \frac{\$ 2}{75}$$&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;A few flicks of the abacus later, we find that the expectation value of our prize is&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;$$\langle W \rangle = \$ 3.02,$$&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;which means that after we subtract the dollar we paid for the ticket, our expected return is $2.02.  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;But what if we had chosen to take our winnings as a lump sum of $359 million instead of the $500 million paid out over a span of 26 years?  In that case we find&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;$$\langle W \rangle = \$ 2.22,$$&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;which results in a $1.22 gain when we subtract the dollar we paid for the ticket.  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;At least in a statistical sense for this particular jackpot, one is better off playing than not playing.  But are we forgetting anything?&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; The Taxman&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;If you win a $500 million jackpot, do you &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; get a $500 million jackpot?  Well, no.  For winnings in a lottery over $5000, the IRS &lt;a href="http://www.irs.gov/instructions/iw2g/ar02.html#d0e401"&gt;withholds&lt;/a&gt; 25% in federal income taxes.  Additionally, the winnings are subject to state taxes as well.  For example, if I were to win, the great state of New York would be entitled to about 6.8% (apparently also just for winnings above $5000).  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;After applying federal and state taxes to the prizes above $5000, we now have an expected winnings of&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;$$ \langle W \rangle = \left[1-(0.25 + 0.068)\right]\times\left(\frac{\mbox{Jackpot}}{175,711,536} + \frac{\$ 250,000}{3,904,701} +\frac{\$ 10,000}{689,065}\right) $$&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;$$+ \frac{\$ 150}{15,313} + \frac{\$ 150}{13,781}+ \frac{\$ 10}{844} + \frac{\$ 7}{306} + \frac{\$ 3}{141} + \frac{\$ 2}{75},$$&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;which gives an expected net win (minus the $1 for the ticket) of $1.10 for the $500 million annuity prize and $0.55 for the $359 million up-front lump sum.  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;We're still in the black, but it's slowly slipping away.  Is there anything else we need to factor in?  Well, yes.  For one thing, winning the jackpot qualifies us for the top tax bracket, so most of the winnings would be taxed at the top marginal tax rate of 35%.  Welcome to the 1%, kids! &lt;a href="#note"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;p id="back"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Changing the federal tax rate on the jackpot from 25% to 35% and recalculating, we find net expected winnings of $0.81 for the $500 million annuity and $0.34 for the $359 million lump sum.  Surprisingly, it is still worth it in a statistical sense.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; Is it always like this?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;One thing to keep in mind as we make these estimates is that this is a &lt;i&gt;historically large&lt;/i&gt; jackpot.  So even though it may be favorable to play this time, this will not always be the case.  In fact, we can find the minimum jackpot value for which this is the case.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;The condition in which our expected return is a gain (rather than a loss) is&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;$$ \langle W \rangle - \$1.00 &amp;gt; 0. $$&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;For simplicity, let's ignore the top marginal tax rate and just factor in the 25% withholding and the 6.8% state tax.  Solving for the minimum jackpot using the expression for &lt;w&gt; we found in the last section, we see that &lt;/w&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;$$ \mbox{Jackpot}_{min} = \$217~\mbox{million}.$$&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Technically, this would have to be the amount actually awarded by the payment method of your choice.  The &lt;i&gt;stated&lt;/i&gt; jackpot is always the annuity method (because it looks higher).  The lump sum offering is &lt;i&gt;at most&lt;/i&gt; about 70% of the stated jackpot.  So if you want to take the lump sum offering the &lt;i&gt;stated&lt;/i&gt; jackpot will need to be &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;$$ \mbox{Jackpot}_{min} = \$217~\mbox{million} / 0.7 = \$310~\mbox{million}.$$&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;In fact, these values are likely a bit low, since we have not included the increase to the marginal tax rate, nor have we included other effects like having to split a prize (which seems to happen a lot) or inflation effects if you take the prize in yearly installments.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;In any case, a quick look through the &lt;a href="http://www.megamillions.com/winners/jackpothistory.asp"&gt;jackpot history&lt;/a&gt; shows that these threshold values are only met occasionally.  An eyeball estimate puts about one jackpot per year that exceeds the (absolute) minimum $217 million threshold.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; So am I going to win?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;No.  No, you will not.  BUT if you played record setting lotteries hundreds of millions of times, you might see decent (~10%) returns.  Although, it may just be easiest to, you know, &lt;i&gt;invest&lt;/i&gt; that money.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Only One Useless Footnote&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="note"&gt;[1] Although, to be fair, the top marginal tax rate is currently at &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:MarginalIncomeTax.svg"&gt;historical lows&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Today, as I'm sure you're aware, is Pi Day - a day for the festive consumption of pies and quiet self-reflection.  In the spirit of the holiday, I'd like to present a point for discussion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Everyone has a great talent for at least one thing.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That this is true for at least &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; people is seen through even a cursory glance at a history book:  George Washington was really good at leading revolutions, Michelangelo was an outstanding ceiling painter &lt;a href="#note1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id="back1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and Batman was the best at solving complex riddles (especially in English, pero &lt;i&gt;especialmente&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RY1U_pXUxUo&amp;amp;feature=related"&gt;en español&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I'm certain that this holds for everyone.  What's your talent? Mine, as those of you who read this blog should know very well by now, is certainly &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; doing physics.  Nope, my talent is watching TV.  Seriously guys, I watch TV like a boss &lt;a href="#note2"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id="back2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  In light of this talent, I thought I would describe a few instances in which I have seen pi represented (for better or for worse) in TV and movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Over the last few months, I have been re-watching a lot of the TV show &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psych"&gt;Psych&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; with my good friend and fellow Virtuosi contributor, Matt "TT" Showbiz &lt;a href="#note3"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id="back3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  For the uninitiated, &lt;i&gt;Psych&lt;/i&gt; is a detective show where the main characters (Shawn and Gus) run a (fake) psychic detective agency, which allows them to solve mysteries, engage in various shenanigans, and make an inordinate number of references to &lt;i&gt;Tears for Fears&lt;/i&gt; frontman Curt Smith &lt;a href="#note4"&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id="back4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of the episodes, Shawn and Gus enter a room where a long train of digits is written across the top of the wall.  It soon becomes evident that these are the digits of pi and the camera is sure to zoom in on the famous first few digits to reassure us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are hundreds of digits written out and I have very little faith in TV prop people when it comes to background mathematical expressions.  So I decided to check it out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sIqwUS9wlog/T17KQ7mU7nI/AAAAAAAAAV4/1hiiMuN-yxA/s1600/pi_psych1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="222" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sIqwUS9wlog/T17KQ7mU7nI/AAAAAAAAAV4/1hiiMuN-yxA/s400/pi_psych1.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Pi on the Wall (click to enhance for texture)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a neat little pi &lt;a href="http://www.angio.net/pi/piquery"&gt;searcher&lt;/a&gt;, I checked to see if (and where) this sequence appeared in pi.  Turns out it's legit and (almost!) correct.  The first 105 digits of pi (counting after the three) are:
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;div id="showstring"&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: white;"&gt;3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510582097494459230781640628620899862803482534211706&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;798&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;2148&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="querytime" style="font-size: 13px; font-style: italic; margin-right: 5px; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: white;"&gt;where I have underlined the 99th, 100th, and 101st digits.  Looking back at the writing on the wall, we see that the 100th digit has been duplicated.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: white;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6vQ2gmfNULw/T17Nb29jAvI/AAAAAAAAAWA/2hMW9vdU3S0/s1600/pi_psych.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="222" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6vQ2gmfNULw/T17Nb29jAvI/AAAAAAAAAWA/2hMW9vdU3S0/s400/pi_psych.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Very Almost Pi&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: white;"&gt;So close!  Oh well, nobody is perfect.  Even though there is an error here, I very much appreciate that whoever was doing the set design decided to use the &lt;i&gt;actual&lt;/i&gt; digits of pi.  All too often I see nonsensical equations in the background of TV shows and movies when it would take &lt;i&gt;exactly the same&lt;/i&gt; amount of work to put real equations there.  So congratulations to you, O nameless prop-making intern!, for giving an accurate (well, to a part in 10^100) value of pi.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: white;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
Neat, so are there any other TV shows or movies that have pi in them?  Well, there's &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo18VIoR2xU" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Pi&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;i&gt;Pi&lt;/i&gt; is film by Darren Aronofsky (&lt;i&gt;Requiem for a Dream&lt;/i&gt;, etc) about a mathematician looking for patterns in the stock market.  It's a pretty good movie with a really cool &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cq_QO_4Cx4&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded"&gt;soundtrack&lt;/a&gt; by Clint Mansell.  It also appears to display the digits of pi in the opening credits.  But does it?  To the Youtube-mobile!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can watch the opening credits &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L61x5mbE-jc"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; if you like and here is a still image of the relevant section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pEbkgRx-PFw/T17UHYdfhwI/AAAAAAAAAWI/vsyzWd139pg/s1600/sad_pi.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="210" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pEbkgRx-PFw/T17UHYdfhwI/AAAAAAAAAWI/vsyzWd139pg/s400/sad_pi.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Pi?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: white;"&gt;Looks pretty cool, huh?  But once we get past the slick aesthetics, we see that something doesn't seem right.  This number they are showing appears at first glance to be our good friend pi, but after the 8th digit the cover is blown and we see that this is actually some impostor number!  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: white;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5afmhwZOhWk/T17U-d1okrI/AAAAAAAAAWQ/KB7NHwwOvQg/s1600/verysadpi.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="210" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5afmhwZOhWk/T17U-d1okrI/AAAAAAAAAWQ/KB7NHwwOvQg/s400/verysadpi.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;More like Darren Aron-wrong-sky.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Now, I fully understand that this has no bearing whatsoever on the film and, in the grand scheme of things, is not a Big Deal.  But it would have been just as easy to put the &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; digits of pi here instead of just random filler. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way that this could possibly be better than the real deal would be if it is actually a secret code.  I have not yet ruled this out, as the movie is entirely about looking for meaning in seemingly random numbers.  Unfortunately, the difficulty in transcribing the numbers from the screen greatly outweighs the very small chance that this isn't just gibberish.  Four hundred Quatloos to anyone who can tell me if this is a code or not!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people know a &lt;i&gt;suspiciously&lt;/i&gt; large number of the digits of pi.  Perhaps you have met one of these people.  They can typically be found hiding behind bushes and under the counters at pastry shops, just... &lt;i&gt;waiting&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the slightest hint of a mention of pi, they will jump out and start reciting the digits like there's a prize at the end.  After rattling off numbers for a few minutes they abruptly come to an end, grin like an idiot, and walk away.  It is an unpleasant encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sheer uselessness of this kind of thing has always bothered me, so I'd like to set a preliminary upper bound on the number of digits of pi that could ever possibly potentially kind of be useful (maybe).  For those following along at home, now would be a good time to put on your numerology hats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Alright, so I hear this thing pi is fairly useful when dealing with circles.  Let's say we want to make a really big circle and have its diameter only deviate by a very small amount from the correct value.  To do this successfully, we will have to know pi fairly well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take this to extremes now.  Suppose I want to put a circle around the &lt;i&gt;entire visible universe&lt;/i&gt; such that the uncertainty in the diameter is the size of a &lt;i&gt;single proton&lt;/i&gt;.  What would be the fractional uncertainty in the circumference in this case?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we know pi exactly, then we have that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$\delta C = \frac{\partial C}{\partial d} \delta d = \pi \delta d = C \frac{\delta d}{d}, $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where d is the diameter and C is the circumference.  In other words, the fractional uncertainty in the circumference is just&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$\frac{\delta C}{C} = \frac{\delta d}{d}. $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a femtometer for the size of a proton and 90 billion light years for the size of the Universe &lt;a href="#note"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id="back"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we get&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$\frac{\delta C}{C} = \frac{\delta d}{d} = \frac{10^{-15}\mbox{m}}{(90\times10^9)(3\times10^7\mbox{s})(3\times10^8\mbox{m s}^{-1})} \sim\frac{10^{-15}}{10^{27}}\sim10^{-42}.$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, so how well do we need to know pi to get a similar fractional uncertainty?  Well, we have that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$\frac{\delta \pi}{\pi} = \frac{\delta C}{C} = 10^{-42}, $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so we can afford an uncertainty in pi of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \delta \pi = \pi \times 10^{-42}$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and thus we'll need to know pi to about 42 digits.  How's that for an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Answer_to_the_Ultimate_Question_of_Life.2C_the_Universe.2C_and_Everything_.2842.29"&gt;answer&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if we have a giant circle the size of the &lt;i&gt;entire visible universe&lt;/i&gt;, we can find its diameter to within the size of a &lt;i&gt;single proton&lt;/i&gt; using pi to 42 digits.  Therefore, I adopt this as the maximal number of digits that could ever prove useful in a physical sense (albeit under a somewhat bizzarre set of circumstances). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If reciting hundreds of digits is what makes you happy, go for it.  But 42 digits is more than enough pi for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was a sunny exception to the grey overcast rule of weather in Ithaca.  I &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; be overjoyed by this anomaly, spending the day outside flying a kite or playing frisbee with a border collie in a bandanna. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, today was also the beginning of Daylight Savings Time (DST) - my least favorite day of the year.  For my colleagues unfamiliar with this temporal travesty (I'm looking at you Arizona), let me briefly explain DST.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a year, the time lords steal a single hour from us and place it in an escrow account for future disbursement, presumably in some elaborate scheme to gain the favor of hat-throwing farmer-clock hybrids (see image left).  The details are a bit murky, but the net result is that today I had one less hour to do my very favorite thing in the whole wide world - sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also means that I have to set my watch, so I figured I'd check in and see how well my &lt;a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2012/02/time-keeps-on-slippin.html"&gt;previous model&lt;/a&gt; for time-loss in my watch has held up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;About a month ago, I looked at how my watch slowly deviated from the &lt;a href="http://nist.time.gov/timezone.cgi?Eastern/d/-5/java"&gt;official time&lt;/a&gt; (the original post can be found &lt;a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2012/02/time-keeps-on-slippin.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and a helpful clarification by Tom can be found &lt;a href="http://blogs.scienceforums.net/swansont/archives/11014"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  Based on a little over 50 days worth of data, I found that my watch lost about 0.35 seconds per day against the official time.  About 50 days have passed since my last measurement and today when I set the watch, so I thought it would be interesting to see how well my model fit the new data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old data are presented in Figure 1 in blue, the old best fit line is in red, and the new data point (taken this morning) is in green.  As always, click through the plot for a larger version.
&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HqpuhvxXl8M/T1115Tz6lnI/AAAAAAAAAVQ/I1AUjQLXres/s1600/dst_update_long.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HqpuhvxXl8M/T1115Tz6lnI/AAAAAAAAAVQ/I1AUjQLXres/s400/dst_update_long.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Figure 1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;The new data point appears to be in fair agreement with the old best-fit model, but it's a little hard to see here.  Zooming in a bit, though, we see that the model lies outside the error bar of the new data point.
&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1euutOYSIrs/T1125Hi_XNI/AAAAAAAAAVY/tnWZ6N3mJJs/s1600/dst_update_short.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1euutOYSIrs/T1125Hi_XNI/AAAAAAAAAVY/tnWZ6N3mJJs/s400/dst_update_short.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Figure 2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;So is this a big deal?  Not really.  But if it will help you sleep at night, we can redo the fitting with the new data point included to see how much things change.  The the plots with the updated model to include all data points are provided below with the old data in blue and the new point in green.
&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oIeLFmzJgKI/T115TGf3laI/AAAAAAAAAVg/RHPJuP9UrKk/s1600/dst_newfit_long.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oIeLFmzJgKI/T115TGf3laI/AAAAAAAAAVg/RHPJuP9UrKk/s400/dst_newfit_long.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Figure 3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;The new model looks a whole lot like the old one, except the best fit line now appears to go through the new data point.  Zooming in a little, we see that it does indeed fall within the error bars of our new point.
&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EUf50O2-jjQ/T11514CpS_I/AAAAAAAAAVo/Ryt2v1LOeVk/s1600/dst_newfit_short.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EUf50O2-jjQ/T11514CpS_I/AAAAAAAAAVo/Ryt2v1LOeVk/s400/dst_newfit_short.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Figure 4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Alright, so the new model fits with our new point, but how much did the model have to change?  Well, the fit to just the old data gave an offset of 0.36 seconds and a loss rate of 0.35 seconds per day.  The new model has an offset of 0.40 seconds and a loss rate of 0.348 seconds per day.  Overall, not a significant change.
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It looks as though I may continue to not worry about the accuracy of my watch.  I have set it to match the official time and have no intention of fiddling with it until I have to set it again at the end of Daylight Savings Time - my favorite day of the year.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="scott bakula"></category><category term="daylight savings time"></category><category term="casio"></category></entry><entry><title>Time Keeps On Slippin'</title><link href="http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/time-keeps-on-slippin-.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-02-12T22:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Corky</name></author><id>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2012-02-12:posts/time-keeps-on-slippin-.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rtzREUF0wYM/TyX0orGHkpI/AAAAAAAAASk/hsRZAwtg7H4/s1600/casi_f91w.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rtzREUF0wYM/TyX0orGHkpI/AAAAAAAAASk/hsRZAwtg7H4/s320/casi_f91w.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;This is picture of a watch.  (Source: Wikipedia)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago, the Virtuosi Action Team (VAT) assembled for lunch and the discussion quickly and unexpectedly turned to watches.  As Nic and Alemi argued over the finer parts of fancy-dancy watch ownership, I looked down at my watch:  the lowly &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_F91W"&gt;Casio F-91W&lt;/a&gt;.  Though it certainly isn't fancy, it is inexpensive, durable, and could potentially win me an all-expense paid trip to the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/25/guantanamo-files-casio-wristwatch-alqaida"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But how &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; of a watch is it?  To find out, I decided to time it against the official U.S. time for a couple of months.  Incidentally, about half-way in I found out that Chad over at &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/principles/"&gt;Uncertain Principles&lt;/a&gt; had done essentially the same thing &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2011/05/the_testing_of_time_measuring.php"&gt;already&lt;/a&gt;.  No matter, science is still fun even if you aren't the first person to do it.  So here's my "new-to-me" analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Alright, so how do we go about quantifying how "good" a watch is?  Well, there seem to be two main things we can test.  The first of these is accuracy.  That is, how close does this watch come to the &lt;i&gt;actual&lt;/i&gt; time (according to some time system)?  If the official time is 3:00 pm and my watch claims it is 5:00 am, then it is not very accurate.  The second measure of "good-ness" is precision or, in watch parlance, stability.  This is essentially a measure of the consistency of the watch.  If I have a watch that is consistently off by 5 minutes from the official time, then it is not accurate but it is still stable.  In essence, a very consistent watch would be just as good as an accurate one, because we can always just subtract off the known offset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test any of the above measures of how "good" my cheap watch is, we will need to know the actual time.  We will adopt the official U.S. time as provided on the &lt;a href="http://nist.time.gov/timezone.cgi?Eastern/d/-5/java"&gt;NIST website&lt;/a&gt;.  This time is determined and maintained by a collection of really impressive atomic clocks.  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST-F1"&gt;One of these&lt;/a&gt; is in Colorado and the other is secretly guarded by an ever-vigilant Time Lord (see Figure 1). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EXMf5o9a4GI/TzCRcaMjjVI/AAAAAAAAASs/FlqyjHbJS9Q/s1600/flavor_flav.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EXMf5o9a4GI/TzCRcaMjjVI/AAAAAAAAASs/FlqyjHbJS9Q/s320/flavor_flav.jpg" width="290" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Figure 1:  Flavor Flav, Keeper of the Time&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 9:00:00 am EST on November 30th, I synchronized my watch with the time displayed on the NIST website.  For the next 54 days, I kept track of the difference between my watch an the NIST time.  On the 55th day, I forgot to check the time and the experiment promptly ended.  The results are plotted below in Figure 2 (and, as with all plots, click through for a larger version).
&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hscjUIehrHQ/TzCYqNhcsYI/AAAAAAAAATE/eAz3O5KlAcY/s1600/time_fit_short.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hscjUIehrHQ/TzCYqNhcsYI/AAAAAAAAATE/eAz3O5KlAcY/s400/time_fit_short.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Figure 2: Best-fit to time difference&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;As you can see from Figure 2, the amount of time the watch lost over the timing period appears to be fairly linear.  There does appear to be a jagged-ness to the data, though.  This is mainly caused by the fact that both the watch and the NIST website only report times to the nearest second.  As a result, the finest time resolution I was willing to report was about half a second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adopting an uncertainty of half a second, I did a least-squares fit of a straight line to the data and found that the watch loses about 0.35 seconds per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as accuracy goes, that's not bad!  No matter what, I'll have to set my watch at least twice a year to appease the Daylight Savings Gods.  The longest stretch between resetting is about 8 months.  If I synchronize my watch with the NIST time to "spring forward" in March, it will only lose about&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ t_{loss} = 8~\mbox{months} \times 30\frac{\mbox{days}}{\mbox{month}} \times 0.35 \frac{\mbox{sec}}{\mbox{day}} = 84~\mbox{sec} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;before I have to re-synchronize to "fall back" in November.  Assuming the loss rate is constant, I'll never be more than about a minute and a half off the "actual" time.  That's good enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if the watch is &lt;i&gt;consistently&lt;/i&gt; losing 0.35 seconds per day and I know how long ago I last synchronized, I can always correct for the offset.  In this case, I can always know the official time to within a second (assuming I can add).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the watch consistent?  That's a good question.  The simplest means of finding the stability of the watch would be to look at the timing residuals between the data and the model.  That is, we will consider how "off" each point is from our constant rate-loss model.  A plot of the results is shown below in Figure 3.
&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-13ULtvOlXuU/TzCpp6LGvfI/AAAAAAAAATM/8rybD1lxZOo/s1600/residuals.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-13ULtvOlXuU/TzCpp6LGvfI/AAAAAAAAATM/8rybD1lxZOo/s400/residuals.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Figure 3: Timing residuals&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;From Figure 3, we see that the data fit the model pretty well.  There's a little bit of a wiggle going on there and we see some strong short-term correlations (the latter is an artifact of the fact that I could only get times to the nearest second). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get some sense of the timing stability from the residuals, we can calculate the standard deviation, which will give us a figure for how "off" the data typically are from the model.  The standard deviation of the residuals is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \sigma_{res} = 0.19~\mbox{sec}. $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good guess at the fractional stability of the watch would then just be the standard deviation divided by the sampling interval,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \frac{\sigma_{res}}{T} = 0.19~\mbox{sec} \times \frac{1}{1~\mbox{day}} \times \frac{1~\mbox{day}}{24\times3600~\mbox{sec}} \approx 2\times10^{-6}.$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In words, this means that each "tick" of the watch is consistent with the average "tick" value to about 2 parts in a million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's nice...but isn't there something &lt;i&gt;fancier&lt;/i&gt; we could be doing?  Well, I have been wanting to learn about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_variance"&gt;Allan variance&lt;/a&gt; for some time now, so let's try that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Allan variance (refs: &lt;a href="http://www.ino.it/~azavatta/References/Allan.pdf"&gt;original paper&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="http://tf.boulder.nist.gov/general/pdf/118.pdf"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;) can be used to find the fractional frequency stability of an oscillator over a wide range of time scales.  Roughly speaking, the Allan variance tells us how averaging our residuals over different chunks of time affects the stability of our data.  The square root of the Allan variance, essentially the "Allan standard deviation," is plotted against various averaging times for our data below in Figure 4.
&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_zhCroHDoNE/TzC7XYkDZ1I/AAAAAAAAATU/mCaspxYhlxA/s1600/allan_variance.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_zhCroHDoNE/TzC7XYkDZ1I/AAAAAAAAATU/mCaspxYhlxA/s400/allan_variance.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Figure 4:  Allan variance of our residuals&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;From Figure 4, we see that as we increase the averaging time from one day to ten days, the Allan deviation decreases.  That is, the averaging reduces the amount of variation in the frequency of the data, making it more stable.  However, at around 10 days of averaging time it seems as though we hit a floor in how low we can go.  Since the error bars get really big here, this may not be a real effect.  If it is real, though, this would be indicative of some low-frequency noise in our oscillator.  For those who prefer colors, this would be "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colors_of_noise"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt;" noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the Allan deviation gives the fractional frequency stability of the oscillator, we have that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$\sigma_A = \frac{\delta f}{f} = \frac{\delta(1/t)}{1/t} = \frac{\delta t}{t}. $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the plot, we see that with an averaging time of one day, the fractional time stability of the watch is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$\frac{\delta t}{t} \approx 2\times10^{-6}, $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which corresponds nicely to our previously calculated value.  If we average over chunks that are ten days long instead, we get a fractional stability of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$\frac{\delta t}{t} \approx 10^{-7}, $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which would correspond to a deviation from our model of about 0.008 seconds.  Not bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial question that started this whole ordeal was "How good is my watch?" and I think we can safely answer that with "as good as I'll ever need it to be."  Hooray for cheap and effective electronics!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago, I stumbled across a bunch of &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/revisited/index.html"&gt;pictures&lt;/a&gt; of Apollo landing sites taken by one of the cameras onboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.  The images have a resolution high enough that you can resolve features on the surface down to about a meter.  Looking at the Apollo 17 &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/584392main_M168000580LR_ap17_area.jpg"&gt;landing site&lt;/a&gt;, you can see the trails of both astronauts and a moon buggy.  It's pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also got me thinking about how long the landing sites would be preserved. More specifically, I want to know how long Buzz Aldrin's right bootprint (shown, incidentally, to the left) will last on the Moon.  Since the Moon has no atmosphere, the wind and rain that would weather away a similar bootprint here on Earth are not present and it seems as though the print would last a really long time. But how long? Let's try to quantify it &lt;a href="#footnote-yariv"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="" id="back-yariv"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-large;"&gt;Pick Your Poison&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get going, we need to figure out what physical process would be most important in erasing a bootprint from the Moon. Although the Moon lacks the conventional "weathering" we experience on Earth (due to wind, rain, etc), it does experience something called "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_weathering"&gt;space weathering&lt;/a&gt;." Space weathering is the changing of the lunar surface due to cosmic rays, micrometeorite collisions, regular meteorite collisions, and the solar wind &lt;a href="#footnote-wind"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="" id="back-wind"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Of these phenomena, the most apparent and well-studied would be the meteorites which have covered the Moon in craters. We adopt the meteorite impact as our primary means of wiping out a bootprint and restate our question as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"How long would it take for a meteorite to hit the Moon such that the resulting crater wipes out Aldrin's right bootprint?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-large;"&gt;Background &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it is currently stated, we can answer our question if we knew the rate of formation and size distribution of the craters on the Moon.  We could count up all the craters on the Moon (or a particular region of interest) and tabulate their sizes.  This would give us the size distribution.  It would also give us a headache and potentially drive us to lunacy &lt;a href="#footnote-forced"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="" id="back-forced"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  Luckily, someone has beat us to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1966MNRAS.134..245C"&gt;Cross (1966)&lt;/a&gt; used images from the Ranger 7 and 8 missions to count craters and determine the size distribution of craters in three regions of the Moon.  The data for the crater distribution in the Sea of Tranquility (where Apollo 11 landed) are given in the figure below.  Cross found that in the Sea of Tranquility, the number of craters with diameters greater than X meters (per million square kilometers) is given by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ N(d&amp;amp;gt;X) = 10^{10}\left(\frac{X}{1~\mbox{m}}\right)^{-2}, $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which holds for craters with diameters between 1 meter and 10 kilometers (see figure below). 
&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kHxcn_PTd5o/TwDg3XGAcqI/AAAAAAAAARg/jl-kb22JD-Y/s1600/fig2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kHxcn_PTd5o/TwDg3XGAcqI/AAAAAAAAARg/jl-kb22JD-Y/s400/fig2.png" width="332" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Figure 2 from Cross (1966)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
We can also estimate the rate at which craters are formed from this data.  If we assume that the craters formed at a constant rate over the age of the Moon (about 4 billion years), then we get about 2.5 craters with diameters above 1 meter formed in a million square kilometer area every year.  This is a "crater flux" for the Moon.  Written another way, the crater flux in the Sea of Tranquility is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$F \approx 1~{\mbox{km}}^{-2} \frac{1}{4\times10^5~\mbox{yr}}, $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so we get that roughly one crater with diameter greater than 1 meter is formed on a square kilometer of the Moon once every 400,000 years or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now have enough information to do some simulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-large;"&gt;Simulation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote up a code that simulates craters being formed on a 1 square kilometer patch of the Moon.  A crater is randomly placed in the 1 square kilometer region with a diameter pulled from the above distribution.  The bootprint is placed at the center of the grid and craters are formed until we get a "hit."  At that point, the time is recorded and the run stops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a sanity check, I thought it would be fun to just let the simulation run without caring if the boot was hit or not.  By simulating the craters in this way for 4 billion years, I should get something that looks like the Moon at the present day. Here's a 200 m square from my simulation:
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DoFPG23CGwg/TwDqo-7GoQI/AAAAAAAAARs/QJW3RxeXFWI/s1600/mymoon_wticks.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DoFPG23CGwg/TwDqo-7GoQI/AAAAAAAAARs/QJW3RxeXFWI/s400/mymoon_wticks.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;and here's a picture of the same-sized region on the surface of the Moon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qWW5dU-aEN8/TwDrDLPy93I/AAAAAAAAAR4/XGOywC79NFU/s1600/200metersquare.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="316" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qWW5dU-aEN8/TwDrDLPy93I/AAAAAAAAAR4/XGOywC79NFU/s320/200metersquare.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Cropped from &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/584398main_M168353795RE_25cm_AP12_area.jpg"&gt;this image&lt;/a&gt; (Source: LRO)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just eyeballing it, things look pretty good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it's time for the actual simulation.  I ran the simulation 10,000 times and tabulated the amount of time needed before the bootprint was hit.  The figure below gives the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function"&gt;CDF&lt;/a&gt; for the hit times in the simulation.  That is, for each time T, we find the fraction of simulations in which the bootprint got hit in a time less than or equal to T. The dashed lines in the plot indicate the amount of time needed to pass for half of the simulations to have recorded a hit.  This time turns out to be about 24 billion years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-L2WLnCepUiw/TwDs7X_njkI/AAAAAAAAASE/jS_-I0Eem4k/s1600/hit_cdf.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-L2WLnCepUiw/TwDs7X_njkI/AAAAAAAAASE/jS_-I0Eem4k/s400/hit_cdf.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;(Click for larger, actually readable version)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-large;"&gt;Conclusions and Caveats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the simulations, the bootprint on the Moon would have about even odds of lasting at least 20 billion years &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; the primary means of destruction is through the formation of a crater from a meteorite.  However, there are a few caveats that should be addressed.  These deal with either the details of the simulation or the assumptions we have made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the simulation, we just took at 1 km square patch of the moon and scaled back the "crater flux" accordingly.  However, this does not fully account for all possible craters that can form.  For example, our simulation would miss an event that hit 50 km away from the target, but had a diameter of 100 km.  Obviously this would hit the target, but we are only seeding craters in the 1 square km region.  This would mean that the actual lifetime of the bootprint would be less than our 24 billion year figure.  Re-running with a 10km by 10km square region, we find a lifetime of 18 billion years.  Thus, an increase in area by a factor of 100 only reduces the age by 25%.  Considering areas much larger than this makes the simulation prohibitively slow, but the order unity effect does not seem too significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we have made a number of assumptions.  The big one is that we have assumed that the craters currently seen on the Moon were formed uniformly in time.  In fact, a large fraction of the craters may have been formed when the Moon was still very young (see &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Heavy_Bombardment"&gt;Late Heavy Bombardment&lt;/a&gt;).  If this were the case, we would have greatly overestimated the rate of crater formation and thus underestimated the time needed to hit the bootprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of these caveats, let's take our value of 20 billion years to be accurate.  What else can we say?  Well, if we are right then we are wrong because the Moon may not last that long (and it's hard to have bootprints on the Moon without a Moon).  Current &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun#Life_cycle"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; have that the Sun will expand into a red giant and (potentially) destroy the Earth (and the Moon) in about 5 billion years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a record of the Apollo astronauts' boot sizes could potentially last as long as the Moon &lt;a href="#footnote-nixon"&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="" id="back-nixon"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  Not bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;Footnotes and Such&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="footnote-yariv"&gt;[1] Now with linked footnotes so Yariv doesn't have to scroll! &lt;a href="#back-yariv"&gt;[back]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="footnote-wind"&gt;[2] There was a fairly recent press release about Coronal Mass Ejections from the Sun "sandblasting" the lunar surface.  For more info, check &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/topics/solarsystem/features/dream-cme.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and note the acronymic acrobatics needed to make them the "DREAM team."  But it's totally worth it. &lt;a href="#back-wind"&gt;[back]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="footnote-forced"&gt;[3]  A horribly forced pun.  But it's totally worth it. &lt;a href="#back-forced"&gt;[back]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Betelgeuse is a massive star at the very end of its life and could explode any second now!&lt;/i&gt;  Every time I hear that I get really &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; excited.  Like a kid in a candy store that's about to see a star blow up like nobody's business.  This giddiness will last for a solid minute before I realize that "any second now" is taken on astronomical timescales and roughly translates to "sometime in the next million years maybe possibly."  Then I feel sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you know what always cheers me up?  Calculating things!  Hooray!  So let's take a look at the ways Betelgeuse could end its life (even if it's not going to happen tomorrow) and how these would affect Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;First, a little background.  Betelgeuse is the bright orangey-red star that sits at the head/armpit of Orion.  It is one of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_brightest_stars"&gt;brightest&lt;/a&gt; stars in the night sky.  Its distance has been measured by the &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipparcos"&gt;Hipparcos&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;satellite to be about 200 parsecs [1] from Earth (about 600 light years).  Betelgeuse is at least 10 times as massive as our Sun and has a diameter that would easily accomodate the orbit of Mars.  In fact, the star is big enough and close enough that it can actually be spatially resolved by the Hubble Space Telescope!  Being so big and bright, Betelgeuse is destined to die young, going out with a bang as a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova#Core_collapse"&gt;core-collapse&lt;/a&gt; supernova.  This massive explosion ejects a good deal of "star stuff" into interstellar space [2] and leaves behind either a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star"&gt;neutron star&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole"&gt;black hole&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, now that we're all caught up, let's turn our focus on this "massive explosion" bit.  What kind of energy scale are we talking about if Betelgeuse blows up?  Well, a pretty good upper bound would be if all of the star's mass (10 solar masses worth!) were converted directly to energy, so&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ E_{max} = mc^2 = 10M_{\odot}\times\left(\frac{2\times10^{30}~\mbox{kg}}{1~M_{\odot}}\right)\times \left(3\times10^8~\mbox{m/s}\right)^2 $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which is about&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ E_{max} \sim 10^{48}~\mbox{J} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and that's nothing to shake a stick at.  But remember, this is if the &lt;i&gt;entire star&lt;/i&gt; were converted directly to energy, and that would be hard to do.  Typical fusion efficiencies are about ~1% [3], so let's say a reasonable estimate for the total nuclear energy available is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ E_{nuc} \sim \eta_{f} \times E_{max} \sim 10^{-2} \times 10^{48}~\mbox{J} \sim 10^{46}~\mbox{J}. $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the total energy released by a typical supernova.  As it turns out though, 99% of this energy is carried away in the form of neutrinos and only about 1% is carried away in photons.  Since we are mainly concerned with how this explosion will affect Earth, and the neutrinos will just pass on by, we will only consider the 1% of energy released in photons that would reasonably interact with Earth.  That gives us&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ E_{ph} \sim 0.01 \times E_{nuc} \sim 10^{44}~\mbox{J}. $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neato, so that's the total amount of energy released in a supernova in the form of photons.  How much of this energy would be deposited at the Earth if Betelgeuse exploded?  Well, if the energy is deposited isotropically (that is, the same in all directions), then the fluence (or time integrated energy flux) is given by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ F_{ph} = \frac{E_{ph}}{4\pi d^2}. $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this is saying is that the total energy release by the supernova spreads out uniformly over a sphere of radius d, so the fluence will give us the amount of energy deposited in each square meter of that sphere (the units of fluence here are J/m^2).  The total energy deposited on Earth is then&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ E_{\oplus} = F_{ph} \times \pi R^2_{\oplus}. $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hot dog!  Let's plug in some numbers, already.  The total energy deposited on the Earth by a symmetrically exploding Betelgeuse at a distance of d = 200 pc (where 1 pc = 3 * 10^16 m) is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$E_{\oplus}=\frac{E_{ph}}{4\pi d^2}\times\pi R^2_{\oplus}\sim 10^{19}~\mbox{J}\left(\frac{E_{ph}}{10^{44}~\mbox{J}}\right)\left(\frac{d}{200~\mbox{pc}}\right)^{-2}.$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, 10^19 J certainly &lt;i&gt;seems&lt;/i&gt; like a lot of energy.  In fact, it is roughly the amount of energy contained in the entire nuclear arsenal of the United States [4].  But it is spread over the entire atmosphere.  Is there a way to gauge how this would affect life on Earth?  We could see how much it would heat up the atmosphere using specific heats:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ E = m_{atm}c_{air}\Delta T $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where c is the specific heat of air (~10^3 J per kg per K).  Oops, looks like we need to know the mass of the atmosphere.  But we can figure this out, the answer is pushing right down on our heads!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know the pressure at the surface of the Earth (1 atm = 101 kPa) and that pressure is just the result of the weight of the atmosphere pushing down on us.  Since pressure is just force / area, we have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ P = F/A = m_{atm}g / A_{\oplus} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ m_{atm} = \frac{P\times4\pi R^2_{\oplus}}{g}=\frac{10^5~\mbox{Pa}\times4\pi (6\times10^6~\mbox{m})^2}{9.8~\mbox{m/s}^2}\approx4\times10^{18}~\mbox{kg}.$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neato, gang.  So we could see a temperature rise of about&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \Delta T = \frac{E_{ph}}{m_{atm}c_{air}}=\frac{10^{19}~\mbox{J}}{4\times10^{18}~\mbox{kg}\times10^3~\mbox{J/ kg K}}\approx0.003~\mbox{K}, $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or three one-thousandths of a degree.  Remember, too, that this will be an upper bound since we are assuming that all this energy is deposited into the atmosphere before it has a chance to cool.  In fact, if the energy is deposited over the course of hours or days, this value will be much less. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it looks like we've wrapped this thing up:  Betelgeuse exploding will most certainly not put the Earth in any danger.  Or did we?  We have considered the case of a symmetric supernova, but there's more than one way to blow up a star.  Massive stars can also end their lives in a fantastic explosion called a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-ray_burst"&gt;gamma-ray burst&lt;/a&gt; (GRBs to the hep cats that study them, some fun facts relegated to [5]).  GRBs are still an intense area of current study, but the current picture (for one type of GRB, at least) is that they are the result of a star blowing up with the energy of the explosion focussed into two narrow beams (see picture below).  Since the flux isn't distributed over the whole sphere, GRBs can be seen at much greater distances than a typical supernova. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-siXXiFnQWHY/TrITJA8z_sI/AAAAAAAAAPU/qStD4_9qLBI/s1600/grb.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="312" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-siXXiFnQWHY/TrITJA8z_sI/AAAAAAAAAPU/qStD4_9qLBI/s320/grb.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Example of a gamma-ray burst, with the explosion
in two beams.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how will this change our answer?  Well, it's going to change the fluence we calculated above.  Instead of spreading the energy out over the whole sphere, it's only going to go to some fraction of the 4pi steradians.  So we get&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ F_{ph} = \frac{E_{ph}}{4\pi f_{\Omega} d^2}, $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where f_{omega} is called the "beaming fraction" and tells us what fraction of the sphere the energy goes through.  Typical GRB beams range from 1 to 10 degrees in radius.  Converting this to radians, we can find the beaming fraction as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ f_{\Omega} = \frac{2 \times \pi \theta^2}{4\pi} \approx 10^{-4}\left(\frac{\theta}{1^\circ}\right)^2,$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so the beaming fraction is 10^-4 and 10^-2 for a beam angle of 1 degree and 10 degrees, respectively.  Alright, so now we can redo the calculations we did for the supernova case, but keeping this beaming fraction around.  The total amount of energy that would hit Earth is then about&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$E_{\oplus}=\frac{E_{ph}}{4\pi f_{\Omega} d^2}\times\pi R^2_{\oplus}\sim 10^{23}~\mbox{J}\left(\frac{E_{ph}}{10^{44}~\mbox{J}}\right)\left(\frac{d}{200~\mbox{pc}}\right)^{-2}\left(\frac{\theta}{1^\circ}\right)^{-2}.$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy sixth-of-a-moley!  Continuing as we did above, we find that this could potentially heat up the atmosphere by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \Delta T = \frac{E_{ph}}{m_{atm}c_{air}}=\frac{10^{23}~\mbox{J}}{4\times10^{18}~\mbox{kg}\times10^3~\mbox{J/ kg K}}\approx3~\mbox{K}\left(\frac{\theta}{1^\circ}\right)^{-2}, $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which is certainly non-negligible.  Now, this won't destroy the planet [6], but it could make things really uncomfortable.  This will be especially true when you realize that a fair amount of the energy carried away from a gamma-ray burst is in the form of (wait for it...) gamma-rays, which will wreck havoc on your DNA.  Remember, though, that this is an absolute worst-case scenario since we have assumed the smallest beaming angle.  But this may still make us a little nervous, so is there anyway to figure out if Betelgeuse could, in fact, beam a gamma-ray burst towards Earth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, yes there is.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jets and beams like those in GRBs typically point along the rotation axis of the star [7].  If we could determine the rotational axis of Betelgeuse, then we could say whether or not there's a chance it's pointed towards us.  It just so happens that Betelgeuse is the only star (aside from our Sun) that is spatially resolved.  If you could measure spectra along the star, you could look for Doppler shifting of absorption lines and say something about the velocity at the surface of the star. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, this has already been done for us (see, for example &lt;a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998AJ....116.2501U"&gt;Uitenbroek et al. 1998&lt;/a&gt;).  These measurements are hard to do since the star is only a few pixels wide, but it appears as though the rotation axis is inclined to the line-of-sight by about 20 degrees (see figure below).  That means this would require a beam with at least a 20 degree radius to hit the Earth.  This appears to be outside the typical ranges observed.   So even if Betelgeuse were to explode in a gamma-ray burst, the beam would miss Earth and hit some dumb other planet nobody cares about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xYILwh0eLEM/TrSTBxflbxI/AAAAAAAAAPc/Amma1aQtmPU/s1600/rotation.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="342" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xYILwh0eLEM/TrSTBxflbxI/AAAAAAAAAPc/Amma1aQtmPU/s400/rotation.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Figure reproduced from Uitenbroek et al. (1998)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, so the moral of the story is that Betelgeuse is completely harmless to people on Earth.  When it does explode, it will be a brilliant supernova that would likely be visible at least a little bit during the day.  It will be the coolest thing that anyone alive (if there are people...) will ever see.  Sadly, this explosion could take place at just about any time during the next million years.  Assuming a uniform distribution over this time period and a human lifetime of order 100 years, there is something like a 1 in 10,000 chance you'll see this in your life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to hope for a spectacular astronomical sight, but don't lose sleep worrying about being hurt by Betelgeuse!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Semi-excessive Footnotes:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  This has nothing to do with the Kessel Run.  For a description of the actual distance unit see &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.  For a circuitous retconning to correct for one throwaway line in &lt;i&gt;Star Wars&lt;/i&gt;, see &lt;a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Kessel_Run"&gt;Wookieepedia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  This is how anything heavier than helium gets distributed throughout the universe.  The hydrogen and helium formed after the Big Bang gets fused into heavier elements in stars and then dispersed out through supernovae.  In fact, most things heavier than Iron actually &lt;i&gt;require&lt;/i&gt; supernovae to even exist.  If you have any gold on you right now (I'm looking at you Mr. T), that only exists &lt;i&gt;because a star exploded!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  Let's consider the case of turning 4 protons into a Helium nucleus.  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium-4"&gt;Helium-4&lt;/a&gt; has a binding energy of about 28 MeV, which means that the total energy of a bound He-4 nucleus is 28 MeV less than its free protons and neutrons (in other words, we need to put in 28 MeV to break it up).  So the process of turning 4 protons into a Helium nucleus gives off 28 MeV worth of energy.  But we had a total of 4 times 1000 MeV worth of matter we could have turned into energy.  Thus, the process was 28 MeV/4000 MeV ~ 0.7% efficient at turning matter into energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  Sometime last year, the United States &lt;a href="http://www.defense.gov/npr/docs/10-05-03_Fact_Sheet_US_Nuclear_Transparency__FINAL_w_Date.pdf"&gt;disclosed&lt;/a&gt; that its nuclear arsenal as of Sept 2009 was something like 5000 warheads.  Assume these to be Megaton warheads.  A Megaton is about 4 * 10^15 J, so the total energy in the US arsenal is about 5000 * 4 * 10^15 J  = 2 * 10^19 J. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  A fun fact about GRBs:  They were discovered by a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vela_(satellite)"&gt;military satellite&lt;/a&gt; looking for illegal nuclear tests, which would emit some gamma-rays.  Instead of seeing a signal on Earth, they saw bursts coming from space.  I really really hope that someone's first thought was that the Russians were testing nukes on the Moon or something.  &lt;i&gt;We must not allow a moon-nuke gap!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  We here at the Virtuosi are contractually obligated to only destroy the Earth in our posts on Earth day.  I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[7]  I am not exactly sure why this is the case.  It is certainly observed to be the case and I thought there was a straightforward explanation for why this was the case, but I don't really have a good explanation.  Although, maybe there just &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_jet"&gt;isn't a good one yet.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[8]  For comparison, there is about a 1 in 3000 &lt;a href="http://www.lightningsafety.com/nlsi_pls/probability.html"&gt;chance&lt;/a&gt; you'll be struck by lightning in your lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="things that probs wont kill you"></category><category term="betelgeuse"></category><category term="scott bakula"></category></entry><entry><title>Futurama Physics</title><link href="http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/futurama-physics.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-08-22T23:44:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Corky</name></author><id>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2011-08-22:posts/futurama-physics.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6STZpSqRmJk/Tk1oSvdCgQI/AAAAAAAAAOc/M9wr0wJUlE8/s1600/global_warming.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6STZpSqRmJk/Tk1oSvdCgQI/AAAAAAAAAOc/M9wr0wJUlE8/s320/global_warming.png" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;The rotting corpses of sunbeams cause global warming.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good news, everyone!  While rummaging through all my old stuff at home, I found my long-lost copy of &lt;i&gt;Toto IV&lt;/i&gt;.  Huzzah for me!  This is entirely unrelated to what I wanted to talk about, but I have it on good authority that Toto's &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azVqekQBK8g"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; syncs up &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; well with this post [1].  I'll tell you when to press play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, what I really wanted to talk about was a fairly well-posed problem in &lt;i&gt;Futurama.&lt;/i&gt;  In the episode "Crimes of the Hot," all of the Earth's robots vent their various "exhausts" into the sky at the same time, using the thrust to push the Earth into an orbit slightly further away from the sun.  As a result of this new orbit, the year is made longer by "exactly one week."  Anything that quantitative is pretty much asking to be analyzed.  Let's explore this problem a bit more then, why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[ &lt;i&gt;Those wishing to get the full aural experience of this post should press &lt;/i&gt;play &lt;i&gt;on their cassette players ... now ]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
First, a little background.  In this episode, it is learned that all the robots (especially Hedonism Bot) emit the greenhouse gases responsible for Global Warming.  The previous solution (detailed &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2taViFH_6_Y"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) is no longer viable, so it is decided that all robots must be destroyed (especially Hedonism Bot).  The disembodied head of Richard Nixon rounds up all the world's robots on the Galapagos [2] to have a "party" so that they may be destroyed by a giant space-based electromagnetic pulse cannon.  In a last-ditch effort to save the robots, Professor Farnsworth has all the robots blast their exhausts into the sky, using the thrust to push the Earth into an orbit further away from the sun, thus solving the problem of global warming once and for all.  As a result of changing the Earth's orbit, the year is "exactly one week longer."  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"&gt;First Pass Through&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so what can we say about the new orbit if all we know is that its orbital period is exactly one week longer?  Well, we know from our good buddy Kepler that the square of the period of a bound orbit is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis [3], so&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$\tau^2 \propto a^3.$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already know the Earth's period (1 year) and semi-major axis (1 &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit"&gt;AU&lt;/a&gt;) before the robo-boost, so we can get rid of the proportionality by writing things in terms of the initial values.  In other words,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \left(\frac{\tau}{1~\mbox{yr}}\right)^2=\left(\frac{a}{1~\mbox{AU}}\right)^3.$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, so we know that our new orbital period is 1 year + 1 week, or since there are 52 weeks in a year, 53/52 years.  So our new semi-major axis is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ a = \left(\frac{1 + 1/52~\mbox{yr}}{1~\mbox{yr}}\right)^{2/3}\mbox{AU}\approx1.013~\mbox{AU},$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or a little over 1% larger than it is currently.  Fair enough.  So would this fix Global Warming for ever and ever?  Let's see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solar flux at some distance d is given by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ S = \frac{L_{\odot}}{4\pi d^2}, $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where L is the luminosity of the sun.  So the ratio of the flux at the new semi-major axis [4] to that before the orbit was changed is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \frac{S}{S_0}=\left(\frac{a_0}{a}\right)^2=\left(\frac{a}{1~\mbox{yr}}\right)^{-2}.$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, so we have the flux, but how do we relate this to temperature?  Well, we know that the power radiated by a blackbody of temperature T is given by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ P = \sigma A T^4, $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where sigma is the Stefan-Boltzmann &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law"&gt;constant&lt;/a&gt;, A is the area of the emitting region and T is the temperature.  For a blackbody in equilibrium, the power coming in is going to be equal to the power going out.  The power coming in is just the solar flux times the cross-section area of Earth, given by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ P_{in} = S\times\pi R^2_{\oplus} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the power going out is just that radiated by the Earth as a blackbody&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ P_{out} =\sigma \times 4\pi R^2_{\oplus}\times T^4. $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equating the power in to the power out gives&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ T = \left( \frac{S}{4\sigma}\right)^{1/4}. $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can find the ratio of the new average Earth temperature to the temperature before the orbital move.  We have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \frac{T}{T_0} =\left( \frac{S}{S_0}\right)^{1/4}=\left( \frac{a_0}{a}\right)^{1/2}\approx0.994$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we take the initial average Earth temperature to be something like T = 300 K, then we find a new temperature of T = 298 K.  Huzzah, a whole 2 degrees cooler! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That may not sound like a lot, but remember, that's the mean global temperature.  Apparently, it only takes a few degrees increase in global average temperatures to make things a bit uncomfortable for people.  The IPCC &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming"&gt;indicates&lt;/a&gt; that the average global surface temperature on Earth in the next century is likely to rise by about 1 to 2 degrees under optimistic scenarios or about 3 to 6 degrees under pessimistic scenarios.  So the robo-boost option is at least in the right ballpark here.  Neat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"&gt;How Big Is The Push?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how big of a push did the robots need to give the Earth to boost it out to this new orbit?  Is this possible?  Let's find out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we need to find out how the Earth's velocity has changed.  We can do this by finding the change in energy.  The total energy of a bound orbit is given by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ E = -\frac{k}{2a}$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; is the semi-major axis of the orbit and &lt;i&gt;k &lt;/i&gt;= &lt;i&gt;GMm&lt;/i&gt;.  So the difference in Earth's energy before and after the robo-boost is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ E_f - E_0 =-\frac{k}{2a_f}-\left(-\frac{k}{2a_0}\right)=\frac{k}{2a_0}\left(1-\frac{a_0}{a_f}\right).$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we also know that Earth's energy in the orbit is given by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ E = -\frac{k}{r} + \frac{1}{2}mv^2, $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so the difference in energy before and after is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ E_f - E_0 =\frac{1}{2}m\left(v^2_f-v^2_0\right), $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where we have found the energies immediately before and immediately after the boost so Earth is pretty much at the same distance from the sun, so the potential energy terms cancel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining our expressions for the change in energy and solving for the final velocity, we find&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ v_f = \left[\frac{GM_{\odot}}{a_0}\left(1-\frac{a_0}{a_f}\right)+v^2_0\right]^{1/2}.$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the initial orbital velocity of the Earth to be 30 km/s, we find that the final velocity of the Earth immediately after the robo-boost is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ v_f = 30.2~\mbox{km/s}$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the robots just need to give a "little" 200 m/s boost to the Earth, right?  Well, we are adding velocity vectors here, so it depends on which direction the robots are pushing.  The magnitude of the final velocity is given by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$v_f = \sqrt{\left({\bf v_0}+{\bf \Delta v} \right)^2}=\sqrt{v^2_0+\Delta v^2-2v_0\Delta v \cos{\beta}},$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where delta v is the boost in velocity caused by the robots and beta is the angle between the initial orbital motion of the Earth and the velocity boost from the robots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they wanted to make it slightly easier on themselves, the robots would have boosted the Earth in the direction it was already moving.  That would make the cosine beta term equal to one and thus minimize the necessary boost.  However, in the show the robots appear to point their exhaust right at the sun (see figure below).  This is essentially at a 90 degree angle to the Earth's orbital motion, so the cosine beta term goes to zero in our expression above. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plugging it all in we find that the magnitude of the robo-boost is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$\Delta v \approx 3.5~\mbox{km/s}.$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see that this is a fair bit larger than the 0.2 km/s needed for a boost parallel to Earth's initial velocity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-w6j6RXF1QEo/TlFUG6hU8PI/AAAAAAAAAOg/lViVcBBpFSA/s1600/delta_v.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-w6j6RXF1QEo/TlFUG6hU8PI/AAAAAAAAAOg/lViVcBBpFSA/s400/delta_v.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Robots blasting from the Galapagos (which now appear to be in China...)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, so how much effort would it take to give that kind of boost to the Earth?  We can quantify this effort in terms of a force or in terms of the energy difference.  Let's do both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the force, we have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}=\frac{M_{\oplus}\Delta v}{\Delta t}.$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we are a little stuck unless we can figure out the duration of the robo-boost.  Watching the episode again, the robots are blasting up exhaust for about a minute but then the show cuts to commercial.  So we don't really know how long they were pushing.  Let's just say an hour, but we'll leave the time in if we want to fiddle with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plugging in numbers, the total force is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ F = 6\times10^{24}~\mbox{N}\left(\frac{\Delta t}{1~\mbox{hr}}\right)^{-1}.$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this force is spread evenly over the billion robots present [5], then each robot would be applying a force of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ F = 6\times10^{15}~\mbox{N},$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which is roughly equivalent to the force it would take to lift up Mount Everest [6].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That wasn't terribly helpful.  Let's look at the work then instead.  The total work done by the robots to move the Earth is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ W = \frac{1}{2}M_{\oplus}\left(v^2_f - v^2_0\right) \approx 4\times10^{31}~\mbox{J}.$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that's a large number.  Could a billion robots feasibly do that much work?  If the robots are each 100 kg, then if the mass of all billion robots were directly converted to energy, we would get&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ E = mc^2 = 10^9\times10^2~\mbox{kg}\times\left(3\times10^8~\mbox{m/s}\right)^2 \approx 10^{28}~\mbox{J},$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or less than a thousandth the total energy needed.  So it looks unlikely that the robots would be able to push the Earth, but that was to be expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"&gt;Changes to The Orbit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's take a look at how the robo-boost affects the entirety of the Earth's new orbit.  In our first pass through the problem, we ignored the fact that the shape of the orbit changed and only focused on the new semi-major axis.  To see why we must also consider the changes to the "shape" of the orbit, take a look at the figure below. 
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3tRZVuztuF0/TlGMMLhegtI/AAAAAAAAAOo/3jzGbWvvM90/s1600/orbits.png" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3tRZVuztuF0/TlGMMLhegtI/AAAAAAAAAOo/3jzGbWvvM90/s400/orbits.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;In the figure, the initial orbit is plotted (black dashed line) as well as two new orbits that each have the appropriate semi-major axis so that the period of revolution is one year and one week.  The difference between the two final orbits comes from the robots pushing in different directions.  In the blue orbit, the boost was made in a direction radially outward from the Sun (that is, perpendicular to the orbital velocity of the Earth).  This is the case shown in the &lt;i&gt;Futurama &lt;/i&gt;episode.  In the red orbit, the boost was made parallel to the orbital velocity of the Earth.  In each case, the boost was applied at the point labeled with an "X." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that jumps out from this figure is that the Earth is always further away from the sun on the red orbit than it was on the initial (dashed black) orbit.  But on the blue orbit, the Earth is further away from the Sun than it was initially for only half the orbit.  On the other half, the blue orbit would actually make the Earth's temperature &lt;i&gt;higher&lt;/i&gt; than it was on the old orbit! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The temperature calculation we made earlier should hold pretty well for the red orbit, since it is essentially a circle.  It would be a little more tricky for the blue orbit, as one would need to get a time-averaged value of the flux over the course of the whole orbit.  A hundred Quatloos to anyone that does the calculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"&gt;Wrap-Up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what have we found out here?  Well, it seems that there are certain scenarios in which boosting the Earth out to a new orbit with period of 1 year + 1 week could cool the Earth by a few degrees.  Granted, we have made some simplifications (the Earth is not a blackbody), but the general idea of the thing should still hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had some fun playing around with this problem and I thought it was neat that there was a good deal of information to get started with from the episode.  The &lt;i&gt;Futurama&lt;/i&gt; people gave an exact period and at least a visual representation of the direction the robots apply their push.  So 600 Quatloos for the writers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"&gt;Not Quite As Useless as Usual Footnotes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] At least I think it says so if you play this &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUjIA3Rt7gk"&gt;song&lt;/a&gt; backwards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2] According to the Wikipedia page for the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_of_the_Hot#Production"&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt;, the location of the Galapagos for the party was chosen because the writers felt that it would be most convenient to push the Earth near the equator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3] The semi-major axis of an ellipse is half of the longest line cutting through the center of the ellipse.  Likewise, the semi-minor axis is half of the shortest line drawn through the center of the ellipse.  Check &lt;a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Ellipse.html"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; out for some more fun stuff on ellipses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4] This is technically incorrect, since the semi-major axis is measured from the center of the ellipse, but the sun is located on one of the foci.  However, this requires information on the eccentricity of the orbit, which we are currently glossing over right now.  Our method is then approximate, but becomes exact in the case where both orbits are circles.  The effect, however, is minor.  At worst, it is semi-minor.  Zing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5] My source for this billion robots number comes from Professor Farnsworth himself.  When it looks like the robots will all be destroyed the Professor says "A billion robot lives are about to be extinguished. Oh, the Jedis are going to feel this one!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6] Well, sort of.  The height of Everest is ~10^4 m, so this gives a volume of ~10^12 m^3.  The density of most metals is around ~10 g/cm^3, which is ~10^4 kg/m^3.  This gives a mass of ~10^16 kg. The weight is then ~10^17 N.  Each robot exerts a force of ~10^16 N.  So not quite, but hey it was the first thing I thought of and it almost worked out so I'm sticking with it!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="orbits"></category><category term="hedonism bot"></category><category term="toto"></category><category term="scott bakula"></category></entry><entry><title>Coriolis Effect on a Home Run</title><link href="http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/coriolis-effect-on-a-home-run.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-07-03T11:52:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Corky</name></author><id>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2011-07-03:posts/coriolis-effect-on-a-home-run.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LxzlQ5iNaaI/Ta458E_AwvI/AAAAAAAAAMc/D0Z4vZS7IzA/s1600/phillies_stadium.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="212" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LxzlQ5iNaaI/Ta458E_AwvI/AAAAAAAAAMc/D0Z4vZS7IzA/s320/phillies_stadium.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Citizen's Bank Park&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like baseball.  Well, technically, I like &lt;strike&gt;laying&lt;/strike&gt;[3] lying on the couch for three hours half-awake eating potato chips and mumbling obscenities at the television.  But let's not split hairs here.
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Anyway, out of curiosity and in partial atonement for the sins of my past [1] I would now like to do a quick calculation to see how much effect the Coriolis force has on a home-run ball.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Coriolis force is one of the artificial forces we have to put in if we are going to pretend the Earth is not rotating.  For a nice intuitive explanation of the Coriolis force see &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/04/coriolis-force-in-a-wipeout-rotating-slide/"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; over at Dot Physics.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Let's now consider the following problem.  Citizen's Bank Park (home to the Philadelphia Phillies) is oriented such that the line from home plate to the foul pole in left field runs essentially South-North.  Imagine now that Ryan Howard hits a hard shot down the third base line (that is, he hits the ball due North).  Assuming it is long enough to be a home run, how with the Coriolis force effect the ball's trajectory?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is a well-posed problem and we could solve it as exactly as we wanted.  But please don't &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;amp;pid=explorer&amp;amp;chrome=true&amp;amp;srcid=0Bwd5hrDOxWsrOGZmMWZkYzQtM2M2Ny00NjlmLTgyYmMtNTQwZjI1ODU1NWI4&amp;amp;hl=en_US"&gt;make me&lt;/a&gt;. It's icky and messy and I don't feel like it.  So let's do some dimensional analysis!  Hooray for that!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So what are the relevant physical quantities in this problem?  Well, we'll certainly need the angular velocity of the Earth and the speed of the baseball.  We'll also need the acceleration due to gravity.  Alright, so what do we want to get out of this?  Well, ideally we'd like to find the distance the ball is displaced from its current trajectory.  So is there any way we can combine an angular velocity, linear velocity and acceleration to get a displacement?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Let's see.  We can write out the dimensions of each in terms of some length, L, and some time, T.  So:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \left[ \Omega \right] = \frac{1}{T} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \left[ v \right] = \frac{L}{T} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \left[ g \right] = \frac{L}{T^2} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
where we have used the notation that [some quantity] = units of that quantity.  Combining these in a general way gives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ L = \left[ v^{\alpha} \Omega^{\beta} g^{\gamma} \right] = \left( \frac{L}{T}\right)^{\alpha}\left( \frac{1}{T}\right)^{\beta}\left( \frac{L}{T^2}\right)^{\gamma} = L^{\alpha+\gamma} T^{-(\alpha+\beta+2\gamma)}$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
Since we want just want a length scale here, we need:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$\alpha+\gamma = 1~~~\mbox{and}~~~\alpha+\beta+2\gamma = 0. $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We can fiddle around with the above two equations to get two new equations that are both functions of alpha.  This gives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$\beta = \alpha - 2~~~\mbox{and}~~~\gamma = 1 - \alpha. $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we have two equations and three unknowns, so we have an infinite number of solutions.  I've listed a few of these in the Table below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_wBdDaNzEP4/Tg_of5pylyI/AAAAAAAAANE/CU2Oe225_UI/s1600/table.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_wBdDaNzEP4/Tg_of5pylyI/AAAAAAAAANE/CU2Oe225_UI/s320/table.png" width="271" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Ways of getting a length&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, we have taken Math as far as we can.  We'll now have to use some physical intuition to narrow down our infinite number of solutions to one.  Hot dog!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way we can choose from these expressions is to see which ones have the correct dependencies on each variable.  So let's consider what we would expect to happen to the deflection of our baseball by the Coriolis force if we changed each variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens if we were to "turn up" the gravity and make g larger?  If we make g much larger, then a baseball hit at a given velocity will not be in the air as long.  If the ball isn't in the air as long, then it won't have as much time to be deflected.  So we would expect the deflection to decrease if we were to increase g.  This suggests that g should be in the denominator of our final expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens if we turn up the velocity of the baseball?  If we hit the ball harder, then it will be in the air longer and thus we would expect it to have more time to be deflected.  Since increasing the velocity would increase the deflection, we would expect v to be in the numerator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens if we turn up the rotation of the Earth?  Well, if the Earth is spinning faster, it's able to rotate more while the ball is in the air.  This would result in a greater deflection in the baseball's path.  Thus, we would expect this term to be in the numerator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, using the above criteria, we have eliminated everything on that table with alpha less than 3 based on physical intuition.  Unfortunately, we still have an infinite number of solutions to choose from (i.e. all those with alpha greater than or equal to 3).  But, we DO have a candidate for the "simplest" solution available, namely the case where alpha = 3.  Since we have exhausted are means of winnowing down our solutions, let's just go with the alpha = 3 case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our dimensional analysis expression for the deflection of a baseball is then&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \Delta x \sim \frac{v^3 \Omega}{g^2} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plugging in typical values of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ v = 50~\mbox{m/s}~~~(110~\mbox{mi/hr}) $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \Omega = 7 \times 10^{-5}~\mbox{rad/s} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ g = 9.8~\mbox{m/s}^2 $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
we get
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \Delta x \approx 0.1~\mbox{m} = 10~\mbox{cm}. $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all fine and good, but which way does the ball get deflected?  Is it fair or foul?  Well, remembering that the Coriolis force is given by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ {\bf F} = -2m{\bf \Omega} \times {\bf v} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and utilizing Ye Olde Right Hand Rule, we see that a ball hit due north will be deflected to the East.  In the case of Citizen's Bank Park, that is fair territory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how good is our estimate?  Well, I did the full calculation (which you can find &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;amp;pid=explorer&amp;amp;chrome=true&amp;amp;srcid=0Bwd5hrDOxWsrOGZmMWZkYzQtM2M2Ny00NjlmLTgyYmMtNTQwZjI1ODU1NWI4&amp;amp;hl=en_US"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) and found that the deflection due to the Coriolis force is given by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \Delta x =-\frac{4}{3}\frac{\Omega v^3_0}{g^2} \cos \phi \sin^3 \alpha \left[1 -3 \tan \phi \cot \alpha  \right] $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;
&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;p, li { white-space: pre-wrap; } &lt;/style&gt; 
where phi is the latitude and alpha is the launch angle of the ball.  We see that this is essentially what we found by dimensional analysis up to that factor of 4/3 and some geometrical terms.  Not bad!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plugging in the same numbers we used before, along with the appropriate latitude and a 45 degree launch angle we find that the ball is deflected by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \Delta x = 5~\mbox{cm}. $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For comparison, we note that the diameter of a baseball is 7.5 cm.  So in the grand scheme of things, this effect is essentially negligible.  [2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That wraps up the calculation, but I'm certain that many of you are still a little wary of this voodoo calculating style.  And you should be!  Although dimensional analysis will give you a result with the proper units and will &lt;i&gt;often&lt;/i&gt; give you approximately the right scale, it is not perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, it can be formalized and made rigorous.  The rigorous demonstration for dimensional analysis is due to Buckingham and his famous pi-theorem.  The original paper can be found behind a pay-wall &lt;a href="http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v4/i4/p345_1"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and a really nice set of notes can be found &lt;a href="http://www.math.ntnu.no/~hanche/notes/buckingham/buckingham-a4.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  It's a pretty neat idea and I highly recommend you check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unnecessary Footnotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[1]  Once in college I argued with a meteorologist named Dr. Thunder over the direction of the Coriolis force on a golf ball for the better half of the front nine at Penn State's golf course.  I was wrong.  Moral of the story:  don't play golf with meteorologists.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
[2]  For a counterargument, see Fisk et al. (1975)&lt;/p&gt;

of &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IrCgCKrv8U"&gt;creatures&lt;/a&gt; that ever lived of ~4.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recently had a big book sale [1] here in town where books were being sold for about a quarter.  Needless to say, I bought far more than I'll probably ever need or read.  One of the books I bought was called &lt;i&gt;General Paleontology&lt;/i&gt; by A. Brouwer [2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I didn't really make it too far in the book.  In fact, I only made it to the first sentence of the second paragraph of the first chapter, when I encountered this line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;"The number of individuals which has populated the Earth since life began is beyond estimation."&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
Horse feathers, I say!  Horse Feathers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of things that ever lived may very well be &lt;i&gt;unknowable&lt;/i&gt;, but it's certainly not beyond estimation.  So below, Alemi and I each provide an estimate for the total number of creatures that have ever lived on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We flipped a coin and I lost, so I guess I'll go first.  My estimation will be a genuine guess-y kind of estimate that doesn't draw too heavily on too many physical considerations.  Instead, I will formulate a series of assumptions and base my final answer on that.  So assuming my assumptions are valid, the answer should give a reasonable estimate to the total number of creatures that have ever lived. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My assumptions are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1)  The number of individuals that have ever lived will be almost entirely dominated by the number of bacteria that have ever lived on Earth.  So to leading order, all the life that has ever lived on Earth is bacteria (or something similar).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2)  Life began at some time, T, in the past and immediately spread to all places on Earth.  Hey, man, it's the power of geometric progression!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3)  The majority of life is found within h = 1 m from the surface of water.  I picked this number since it's roughly (order of magnitude) how far down I can see in really clear water.  Most of the life will be photosynthetic and thus need a fair amount of sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(4)  The number density of organisms in water is  n ~ 10^5.  I have no real justification for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(5)  The average lifetime of an organism is t ~ 1 hr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, so if these assumptions are valid (a big if [3]), then the following prediction should be fairly accurate.  So the total volume in which these creatures may live is just the shell of the Earth down to about a meter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ V = 4 \pi R_{\oplus}^2 h $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where R = 6 * 10^6 m is the radius of the Earth.  Alright, so the number of creatures at any given moment will be the volume times the number density which I will take to be n ~ 10^5.  That will give us the total number of creatures at any given moment.  But we want it for &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; the moments.  So I will take the total number of "generations" to be the time life has been around divided by the average lifetime of a given organism.  Putting this all together gives&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$N = 4 \pi R_{\oplus}^2 h \times \frac{T}{t} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plugging in some numbers I get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ N \sim 10^{39} \left(\frac{h}{1~\mbox{m}}\right)\left(\frac{n}{10^5~\mbox{cm}^{-3}}\right)\left(\frac{T}{3\times10^9~\mbox{yrs}} \right)\left(\frac{t}{1~\mbox{hr}} \right)^{-1}$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for the nominal values I've plugged in, I'll get that about 10^39 creatures have ever lived on Earth [4].  I've left my equation in a dimensionless form above, so if you think my individual estimates are garbage, you can easily plug in your own estimates to see how things change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for the completely arbitrary factor for the average number density of organisms per cubic centimeter of water, I feel alright about this estimate.  And I'm fairly confident that the number density will not be off more than about 3 orders of magnitude either high or low.  So my final estimate is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ N \sim 10^{39 \pm 3} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I promised that there would be two estimates, so I present below in picture form, Alemi's back-of-the-wrapper estimate.
&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Eq37GVo3d8A/TggHx19J1pI/AAAAAAAAANA/Y0H3DTVb2so/s1600/jj_phys.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="238" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Eq37GVo3d8A/TggHx19J1pI/AAAAAAAAANA/Y0H3DTVb2so/s400/jj_phys.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Click for the full Jimmy Johns experience&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;To explain these scribbles, I now cede the floor (and the mic) to Alemi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ SEAMLESS TRANSITION ]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when Corky posed this question to me while we ate some tasty sandwiches, another approach came to mind.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Namely, I wanted to try to estimate the number of critters that have ever lived by putting some kind of energy bound on the number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, all critters come from the sun.  That is, all life on Earth is only able to exist in so much as it consumes energy, and for almost all life [ignoring the under ocean heat vent guys], the energy they consume, one way or another comes from the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let's estimate the number of critters in three parts (1) We need the energy the Earth recieves from the sun.  (2) We need to estimate the energy density of life (3) These two things, combined with a characteristic length or volume scale for a critter would enable us to figure out the rate at which the Earth could produce critters. (4) Assuming this rate and a time scale for how long life has been around on the Earth would give us a total number of critters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's begin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) Energy from the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corky and I happen to know that the solar flux on the sun is roughly 1000 W/m^2.  Multiplying this by half the surface area of the earth gives us a rough total solar flux&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ (1000 \text{ W/m}^2) ( 2\pi R_{\oplus}^2) \sim 2 \times 10^{17} \text{ W} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) Energy density of critters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this we used the bag of potato chips we had on hand, assuming that all life matter has roughly the same energy content.  The bag of chips was 150 calories in a serving size of 28 grams.  This and assuming that life forms are the density of water gives us a life energy density&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$  \left( \frac{ 150 \text{ kcal} }{ 28 \text{ g}} \right)\left( \frac{ 1 \text{ g}}{ \text{ cm}^3} \right)  \sim  2 \times 10^4 \text{ J/cm}^3  $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) Length scale of critters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We assumed that bacteria are the most abundant life form, so we chose a length scale of 100 microns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting these pieces together gives&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \frac{ 2 \times 10^{17} \text{ W} }{ \left(  2 \times 10^4 \text{ J/cm}^3 \right) \left( 100\ \mu\text{m} \right)^3 }  \sim 10^{19} \text{ 1/s}  $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is our estimated critter creation rate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(4) Time scale for life generation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we estimate that life creation has been chugging along on earth for about 3 billion years, this gives us our final estimate for the number of critters that have every lived&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$  \left(  10^{19} \text{ 1/s} \right) \left( 3 \times 10^9 \text{ years} \right) \sim 10^{36} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there we have it.  If the Earth was 100% efficient at converting solar energy into life, and that life is characteristically the energy density of a potato chip and the size of a bacteria, we should have had 1 billion billion billion billion critters ever.  To make us feel a little better we would like to tack on a 10% efficiency, since we don't actually expect the Earth to be 100% efficient, and because 10% seems to be the rule of thumb efficiency estimation used when it comes to food chains and the like, so our final estimate, motivated purely by physics is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \boxed{ \text{ Total number of critters ever } = 10^{35\pm 3} } $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This number seems pretty good, and is in general agreement with Corky's earlier method.  Notice that the only parameter we are a little worried about the is the length scale, especially because our final answer depends on the inverse cube of this number, so, our error is probably something around 3 orders of magnitude, as before, since an order of magnitude goof in the size would cause 3 orders of magnitude error in the final estimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you have it.  Two not-egregiously-horrible estimates for the total number of critters that have ever lived.  All in all, I think that book was a quarter well spent!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unnecessary footnotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  This is a bit misleading.  They actually sold books of all sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  I like to read about paleontology and such just in case I'm ever sent back in time.  This way, I'll know what dinosaurs are safe to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  Here's a bigger if:  &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
[4]  FUN FACT:  The total number of atoms in all the people on Earth is roughly 10^39.  A proof of this is left as an exercise for the reader.

&lt;p&gt;People that know me well know that I have a lot in common with Robert Frost.  We both were born in March and we both employ rural New England settings to explore complex social and philosophical themes in our poetry.  We also like the same rap groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In honor of my literary doppelganger, I will now, having already had the world end in &lt;a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/04/end-of-earth-physics-i.html"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, try my hand at ice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's try to answer the question:  "If the sun blinks out of existence this instant, what is the temperature of the Earth as a function of time?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Sun, in addition to being the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haAhdtDmsOw"&gt;King of Planets&lt;/a&gt;, is also what keeps us all warm and toasty and alive.  What happens if we turn that off?  Well, the Earth will cool by radiating its heat away into space.  To see how long this would take, let's make some assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's model the surface of the Earth as an ocean 1 km deep and let's pretend that all the heat is stored in this ocean.  Let's take the ocean to be liquid water at T = 0 degrees Celsius.  How long will it take this ocean to freeze into ice at 0 degrees Celsius?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the amount of energy released from the oceans as the water freezes is given by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ Q = L_{w} M_{ocean} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where L is the "latent heat of fusion" and M is the mass of the water.  The "latent heat of fusion" is a fancy way of saying "the amount of energy released per unit mass as water turns to ice at constant temperature."  For water, we have that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ L_{w} = 3.3 \times 10^5 \mbox{J/kg} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for the mass of the ocean, it will be convenient later to write it as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ M_{ocean} = 4\pi {R_{\oplus}}^2 \Delta R \rho $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, so now we've got enough to say how much heat energy we have, so how fast do we lose it?  We can take the Earth to be a blackbody radiator, so the power lost in such a case is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ P =4\pi \sigma R_{\oplus}^2 T^4 $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Power is just Energy per unit Time, we now have all we need to get the time for total freezing of all the oceans.  We have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ t = \frac{Q}{P} = \frac{4\pi {R_{\oplus}}^2 \Delta R \rho L_{w}}{4\pi \sigma R_{\oplus}^2 T^4} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simplifying the above expression a bit, we get&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ t =\frac{\Delta R \rho L_{w}}{\sigma T^4} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can plug in some numbers,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ t =\frac{\left(10^3 \mbox{ m}\right) \times \left(10^3 \frac{kg}{m^3}\right) \times \left(3.3 \times 10^5 \mbox{J/kg}\right)}{\left( 5.67 \times 10^{-8} J s^{-1} m^{-2} K^{-4}\right) \times \left( 273 K\right)^4} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where we have made sure to put our temperatures in Kelvin.  Crunching the numbers with the calculator we "borrowed" from Nic three months ago gives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ t = 10^9 \mbox{ s} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remembering that a year is very nearly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ 1 \mbox{ year} = \pi \times 10^7 \mbox{ s}, $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we find that the time for the oceans to freeze after the sun disappears is about 30 years.  Hooray!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this model was very simple.  First of all, I assumed that the ocean temperatures were already at 0 degrees, but they are a bit warmer.  If the oceans are about 300 K (ie 80 degrees in not-Yariv units), then we get another 30 years to cool down to freezing temperatures.  Secondly, I have completely neglected the heat stored in the Earth.  Will this change my answer by an embarrassingly large factor?  Lastly, I have ignored all internal heating mechanisms (ie, radioactive decay) that will also heat up the Earth.  But ignoring all that....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So is there a way for anyone to survive this?  Well, for the most part it will mean the end of life on Earth.  There could potentially be a few exceptions, like by geothermal vents and such.  But for the most part, it's one quick cold spiral down to eternal nothingness.  But what about a few people, could they survive for a bit even if the human race is doomed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm glad you asked!  You see, I have this plan involving mine shafts.  Hunkering down underground with a nuclear power plant and all the canned food food we can stomach should allow us to at least ride the rest of our lives.

I don't know why I do this, but I assume it's the same reason people slow down for car wrecks and pay to see the geek [1].  Anyway, the big thing in political news now is that if Congress can't pass a budget [2] by the end of the day Friday, the government will shut down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shutting down the government means that 800,000 federal employees will go without pay [3], lots of services will be put on hold and you won't be able to go to the Smithsonian or the Grand Canyon.  So it's kind of a big deal.  Since the ramifications of a government shutdown are so serious, there must be some really important disagreements holding it up, right?  Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick search (for example, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/07/us-congress-staff-government-shutdown"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), shows that the big hold-up in passing the budget comes over a disagreement on how much money should be cut from the budget.  Republicans want to cut &lt;mathjax&gt;$40 billion dollars and Democrats are willing to cut $&lt;/mathjax&gt;34.5 billion dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the hold-up is over $5.5 billion.  Let's consider how utterly and stupidly insignificant this is.
&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
We shall take as our inspiration Alemi's &lt;a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/12/law-and-large-numbers.html"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; a while back offering several ways to help visualize the large and scary sounding numbers thrown around in government budgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing we'd like to do is find out what fraction this &lt;mathjax&gt;$5.5 billion discrepancy is compared to the total budget.  Alemi cites the total budget of the U.S. government in the 2010 fiscal year to be $&lt;/mathjax&gt;3.55 trillion.  Hot dog!  So we see that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \frac{\mbox{Disputed Difference}}{\mbox{Total Budget}} = \frac{\$5.5 \times 10^9}{\$3.55 \times 10^{12}} = 0.0015 $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the disputed part amounts to 0.15% of the total budget or one and half parts in a thousand.  Let's compare this to some things for which we have a better sense of scale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's pretend we are looking to buy a car.  We need it to get to work and, you know, get stuff done.  If our car costs $10,000 dollars then 0.15% of our total costs will be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \mbox{\$10,000} \times 0.0015 = \$15 $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the current budget situation is like arguing for 6 months over a &lt;mathjax&gt;$15 charge on your $&lt;/mathjax&gt;10,000 car.  Sounds reasonable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's switch gears and consider a timescale.  Let's consider a 40 hour work week.  What's 0.15% of 40 hours?  This comes to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ 40 \mbox{ hr} \times 0.0015 = 0.06 \mbox{ hr} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or, if you prefer,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ 0.06 \mbox{ hr} \times \frac{60 \mbox{ min}}{1 \mbox{ hr}} = 3.6 \mbox{ minutes} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the current budget problem is like arguing for six months over about three and a half extra minutes to your work week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's consider a length scale.  Consider the US $1 bill.  According to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_one-dollar_bill#Small_size_notes"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, the dollar bill is 6.14 inches long, 2.61 inches wide and 0.0043 inches thick.  That means that the ratio of the thickness to the width of a dollar bill is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \frac{\mbox{Thickness}}{\mbox{Width}} = \frac{0.0043 \mbox{ inches}}{2.61 \mbox{ inches}} = 0.0016 $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or slightly &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; than the disputed fraction of the budget.  Hooray!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That's all well and nice," you say, lowering your voice and leaning over in a way that makes me uncomfortable, "but who is to &lt;i&gt;blame&lt;/i&gt;?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a great question!  My answer will take the form of an experiment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, get a coin.  Got it?  Great.  Now if you're Republican, let heads be "The Republicans" and tails be "The Democrats."  If you're a Democrat, let heads be "The Democrats" and tails be "The Republicans."  If you are neither, then randomly assign a party to heads and allow the other to be tails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ready?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coin is to blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  I use this in its original meaning.  That is, the guy whose job it was to do horribly gross things at a carnival for money, not the guy whose main form of social interaction is debating scenes in Star Wars on internet forums.  A more up-to-date comparison would have been to say "for the same reason that people watch &lt;i&gt;Jersey Shore&lt;/i&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  That is, the budget for the 2011 fiscal year, which started on October 1st 2010. &lt;/p&gt;

Hopefully we'll be able to fix this sometime soon...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Update [04/02/11]:  We made the code faster, so check out the new and improved Clicky!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, kids!  Would you like to be a bit player in a grand experiment with poorly thought out objectives?  If so, then check &lt;a href="http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~aalemi/clicky/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; out.  It's a little interactive "game" [1] that Alemi and Matt coded up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you click on the link, you will be redirected to a page showing something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FYqCFtPrbT0/TZaZF4ubmPI/AAAAAAAAAMM/5Hf-_v0wTrY/s1600/clicky1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FYqCFtPrbT0/TZaZF4ubmPI/AAAAAAAAAMM/5Hf-_v0wTrY/s400/clicky1.png" width="335" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Using the arrow keys on your keyboard or by clicking on the arrow buttons on the screen, you can move the dot around.  Sound fun yet?  Well, the interesting bit comes in with the fact that anyone who wants to can move the same dot at the same time.  The plot will update automatically, so if you're really bored you can sit around and watch someone else move the dot around.  Heck, you could even give the dot a cute name like Mr. Dottington and tell it how your day was.  We won't judge you.  [2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, check it out if you've got a bit of time to kill.  Explore the space and we'll get back to you with the "results" of this "experiment" sometime in the "future."   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  There are no objectives and "winning" is undefined (for a contrary argument, however, see Sheen et. al (2011))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've been at this whole blogging thing for about a year now and I think we've amassed a large and dedicated enough fanbase to finally release a book!  The track record so far for physicist-writers has been &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Spiral-Novel-Paul-McEuen/dp/038534211X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1301633241&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;quite good&lt;/a&gt; of late, so we figured why not us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, lots of reasons actually.  For one thing, it's &lt;i&gt;really hard&lt;/i&gt;.  Books are, like, &lt;i&gt;hundreds&lt;/i&gt; of pages long.  I barely stay coherent and on-topic in a one page blog post.  For another thing, it takes lots of time.  I hardly have enough time to do my laundry in time scales deemed "socially acceptable."  How could I ever find the time to write a book? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these potential setbacks, the millions and millions of dollars that writers make still seems really appealing.  Who wouldn't want to be rich and popular forever.  I mean, just look at Oscar Wilde, Edgar Allan Poe and Herman Melville!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, a solution presented itself.  I don't have time to write a book now, but I found an old copy of my novel &lt;i&gt;Blue Dragon&lt;/i&gt; laying around the house that I was able to sell using the immense popularity of the Virtuosi brand.  The book will be published this summer by Clark Hall Publishing.  Here are a few advance reviews:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Audacious, bodacious, entropic, synoptic, electric, eclectic, entertaining, hyperbraining, high-roller, tripolar... Buy &lt;/i&gt;&lt;s&gt;Against the Day&lt;/s&gt; Blue Dragon."
     -- THE PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Corky isn't easy to 'get'.  His melodies and chords I would describe as complicated. But, behind all the disharmony and 11ths and so forth.. it swings. This is my favorite Virtuosi book. It's an amazing book and that's all you can say."&lt;/i&gt;
     -- J.D. Jackson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;i&gt;This is a book rich in allegory and poignant social commentary.  Also, you should call home more"&lt;/i&gt;
     -- Corky's Mom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So these unbiased critics think it's totally rad.  Should you just take their word for it?  Absolutely!  But if you really want see the book for yourself, here it is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While flipping through a CRC Handbook whose days in the United States are dwindling, I came across a section that described the naming conventions of each chemical element.  Most of the names made sense to me.  For example, Nobelium is named after Alfred Nobel (surprise!).  However, the Nickel entry was the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nickel: Named after &lt;i&gt;Satan &lt;/i&gt;or &lt;i&gt;Old Nick&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
This confused me greatly.  What the heck is Santa Claus doing hanging out with Satan [1]? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bit of poking around on the internet, I found an article from 1931 by a guy named William Baldwin called &lt;i&gt;The Story of Nickel,  How "Old Nick's" Gnomes were Outwitted&lt;/i&gt;.  Needless to say, this did not allay my confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;Here is the relevant passage from the article:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;In the early part of the eighteenth century fresh lodes of ore were laid open in Saxony where  from times immemorial silver and copper mines had been worked.  This new ore was so glittering and full of promise as to cause the greatest excitement,  but after innumerable trials and endless labor all &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;that could he obtained from the ore was a worthless metal.  In disgust the  superstitious miners named the ore kupfer-nickel after "Old  Nick" and his mischievous gnomes who were charged with  plaguing the miners and bewitching the ore.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;This "worthless" metal is nickel.  Kupfernickel is the German name for the nickel ore (see image below) which comes from the words &lt;i&gt;kupfer&lt;/i&gt;, meaning "copper" and &lt;i&gt;nickel&lt;/i&gt;, meaning "demon."  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9psfFrm6qec/TZQZVPtLD0I/AAAAAAAAAK8/wyMrVWYT7Zo/s1600/niccolite.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="235" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9psfFrm6qec/TZQZVPtLD0I/AAAAAAAAAK8/wyMrVWYT7Zo/s400/niccolite.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Ore that, if not for gnomes, would contain that sweet sweet copper&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;And that's the story of Nickel!  Tune in next time [2] for our ongoing 118-part series, &lt;i&gt;Better Know an Element!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;[1]  Turns out "Old Nick" is an English name for the Devil.  Go figure.  But those of you named Nicholas should not be upset, as your name comes from the Greek &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Nikholaos&lt;/span&gt;, which literally means "victory-people."  So you've got that going for you.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the First Physics Challenge Problem Award Show!  We received an integer number of solutions to our challenge problem and at long last and after much deliberation, we have chosen our winner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had before indicated vaguely that there may be some sort of prizes involved in this competition.  After consultation with our financial advisors and breaking Alemi's piggy bank, we have decided on the following prizes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Place:  A brand new CRC Handbook!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second Place: An autographed [1] picture of Scott Bakula!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honorable Mention:  Nothing! [2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;So before we officially announce our winner, let's backtrack and build up some suspense.  The challenge was to come up with a bunch of MacGyveresque experiments to determine as closely as possible the standard second, meter and kilogram using only the materials handy to you on a desert [3] island. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just about every response we got successfully answered the question, so we had to base our final result on robustness and uncertainties.  We also tended to favor those that did not rest on precise knowledge of one's own height, weight, etc (though there is nothing wrong with these approaches).  So without further ado, the winner is....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[pause]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[unnecessarily long secondary pause]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George from Australia!  George provided a list of no fewer than 11 different methods for determining the second, meter and kilogram.  The second was found by timing (by means of a pendulum) the time it takes for the sun to move through an a given angle measure.  This measurement can be made each day for a year to get the best results (remember, you've got all the time in the world!).  Now we have the time it takes the sun to go through a given angle measured in "swings of a pendulum."  We can calculate the transit time of the sun into seconds and then we can find the number of seconds per swing of the pendulum.  So now we have a second.  But since the period of a pendulum is given by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ T = 2\pi \sqrt{l/g}, $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we also have the length of the pendulum in meters.  From this we can make a standard meter.  Now all that is left is to find the kilogram.  This can be done by making a water-tight enclosure of volume 1000 cm^3 and filling it with water, giving a kilogram that can be compared to other objects to get a longer lasting standard kilogram.  Any other knowledge you may have (i.e. known height and weight) may be used to check the above measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very close second place goes to Alireza, who provided a very strong submission and perhaps one of the best uses of snail mucus in the entire competition!  Alireza's solution was to use one's own known height to construct the standard meter.  From this you can make a pendulum to get the second and a box o' water (sealed with tar, glue and snail mucus) to get the kilogram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both George and Alireza provided very detailed responses with special attention paid toward reducing uncertainty and checking their answers through several independent measurements.  They also both carried out parts of their experiments.  Congratulations to you both!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the winning responses, we also received several other submissions that merit honorable mention.  They are....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oliver, who provided several acoustical experiments using his SUPERPOWER of perfect pitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole, who noted that we were not correct in giving the Titanic the designation "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty%27s_Ship"&gt;HMS&lt;/a&gt;" as this is reserved for ships in the British Royal Navy.  In fact, the Titanic was designated "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Mail_Ship"&gt;RMS&lt;/a&gt;" since it carried mail.  Thanks, Nicole!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary, who completely ignored the premise, used arbitrary units and left a very amusing note on his deathbed giving all his arbitrary units to be found and converted by the first enterprising explorer who lands on his island.  I know you had asked for your prize in cash and while I cannot directly accomodate that wish, do know that Richard Dean Anderson smiles can be cashed in most banks nationwide (see [2]). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So thanks to everyone who submitted a response to this Challenge.  We enjoyed reading all of the solutions and we hope you had fun thinking about it.  And next time you go on a boat, don't forget that CRC!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  Autograph will be signed by me on an 8.5" x 11" picture of Scott Bakula printed by a laser printer on regular copy paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2]  Well, you receive nothing of monetary value but, know deep down in your hearts that in the picture at the top of this post, Richard Dean Anderson is smiling at you.  So you've got that going for you, which is nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]  Sadly, we did not choose a dessert island.  That would have been much more fun.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="physics challenge"></category><category term="macguyver"></category><category term="scott bakula"></category></entry><entry><title>The Magnetar Credit Card Swipe</title><link href="http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/the-magnetar-credit-card-swipe.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-01-30T17:22:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Corky</name></author><id>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2011-01-30:posts/the-magnetar-credit-card-swipe.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TTumQ-3TLgI/AAAAAAAAAJE/BI366RfOTR0/s1600/nedflanderscredit.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="214" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TTumQ-3TLgI/AAAAAAAAAJE/BI366RfOTR0/s320/nedflanderscredit.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Ned Flanders' credit card doesn't satisfy the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm"&gt;Luhn&lt;/a&gt; checksum, 
but could probably still be erased by a magnetar. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello, Internet!  Today I'd like to talk about the Magnetar Credit Card Swipe.  Sounds like some sinister short on a derivatives deal, doesn't it?  Well, no need to worry, we don't deal with scary things like that here.  Instead, we are going to talk about a super-magnetized neutron star speeding past Earth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A while ago I heard that a magnetar can erase all the world's credit cards from half the distance to the moon.  I did a little research and it seems like this is the go-to "fun fact" about magnetars.  Almost every time they are brought up in a popular science article, their credit card-erasing prowess is sure to get a mention.  So let's check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
First things first, though.  What the heck is a magnetar [1]?  Well, "magnetar" is just a spiffy name for a particular flavor of neutron star.  Now, neutron stars are already pretty extreme objects.  They've got a little more than the mass of the sun squished down to the size of a big city with a central density over 10 trillion times greater than lead.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TUXMdXcrmoI/AAAAAAAAAJI/K2MVmanh5g4/s1600/earthmag.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="187" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TUXMdXcrmoI/AAAAAAAAAJI/K2MVmanh5g4/s200/earthmag.png" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Dipolar magnetic field&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes magnetars truly name-worthy (and more extreme than Doritos and Mountain Dew at the X-Games) is the fact that they have strong magnetic fields.  And when I say strong, I mean &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; strong.  Taking the magnetic field to be dipolar (like the Earth's, see figure), the field at the poles of a magnetar can be as high as 10^15 gauss [2].  For comparison, the magnetic field of the Earth is about half a gauss and the big magnets used in MRIs are about 10^4 gauss.  So we're talking about some big fields!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking up the specs for a typical credit card, it looks like most take about 1000 gauss to erase.  And now we can get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always forget the exact form of the magnetic field of a dipole, but Jackson doesn't.  He tells me that it is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \vec{B}\left(\vec{r}\right) = \frac{3\vec{n}\left(\vec{n}\cdot\vec{m}\right) - \vec{m}}{|\vec{r} |^3}$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where m is the magnetic dipole moment, r is the displacement vector to where we are measuring the field, and n is a unit vector that points to where we are measuring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find the magnitude (which is what we really care about), we just take the dot product of the vector with itself and take the square root.  Working this out we get&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ B\left(\vec{r}\right) = \frac{|\vec{m}|}{r^3}{\left[ 3\cos^2{\theta}+1\right]}^{1/2} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where theta is the angle between the magnetic moment vector and the direction vector n.  But we are just looking for a rough estimate here so let's just set the cosine term to one.  Now we have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;$$ B\left(r\right) = \frac{2|\vec{m}|}{r^3}$$&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;We can now use the above to our advantage.  Since we are assuming we know the polar magnetic field strength, we can rearrange and solve for the magnetic moment.  At the pole of a star the distance is just going to be the radius, so for radius R and field strength Bp, we get&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;$$ |\vec{m}|} = \frac{1}{2}B_{p}R^3 $$&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;Plugging this back in, we get a nice little formula for the strength of the magnetic field in terms of the stellar radius and the polar field strength&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;$$B(r) = B_{p}{\left(\frac{R}{r}\right)}^3 $$&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;And we are almost there!  Rearranging now for r, we get

$$r = R{\left[\frac{B_p}{B(r)}\right]}^{1/3} $$

Huzzah!  Now we just need to plug in some values.  Well, we'll use Bp  = 10^15 gauss, B(r) = 1000 gauss (strong enough field to erase credit cards) and R = 10 km, which gives...

$$ r \approx 10km \times {\left(\frac{10^{15}gauss}{10^{3}gauss}\right)}^{1/3} $$

so

$$ r \approx \mbox{100,000 km} $$

The moon is about 380,000 km away.  So we find that the magnetar will erase all credit cards up to a little over a quarter the distance to the moon.  Not bad!  However, all this talk of "half" and "quarter" is a bit misleading given that our best guesses here will be order of magnitude.

But, overall, we see that a magnetar at roughly the Earth-Moon distance would have a good shot at erasing your credit cards.  Fun fact confirmed!

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;[2]  For those of you who prefer your magnetic field strengths given in units named after someone played by David Bowie in a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prestige_(film)#Cast"&gt;movie&lt;/a&gt;, you may note the conversion:  1 gauss = 10^-4 tesla.&lt;/div&gt;</summary><category term="magnetar"></category><category term="credit cards"></category><category term="scott bakula"></category><category term="neutron star"></category></entry><entry><title>Holiday Hidden Message Revealed</title><link href="http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/holiday-hidden-message-revealed.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-01-03T23:52:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Corky</name></author><id>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2011-01-03:posts/holiday-hidden-message-revealed.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TSDGkyEUkPI/AAAAAAAAAIc/4rTQYB9jyNE/s1600/longfellow.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TSDGkyEUkPI/AAAAAAAAAIc/4rTQYB9jyNE/s320/longfellow.jpg" width="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we present the solution to the Holiday Code (original post &lt;a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/12/holiday-hidden-message.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  The content of the message is from the creepy looking gentleman to the left, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.  He is perhaps most famous for writing the poem, "Paul Revere's Ride." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have taken another one of his popular poems, "&lt;a href="http://www.potw.org/archive/potw118.html"&gt;Christmas Bells&lt;/a&gt;," and hidden its first verse in a huge mess of random letters.  The message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"&gt;"I heard the bells on Christmas Day
Their old, familiar carols play,
And wild and sweet
The words repeat &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"&gt;Of peace on earth, good-will to men!"&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds pretty pleasant at the start.  But it was written at the height of the Civil War and it gets pretty heavy towards the end.  Longfellow was an ardent abolitionist and most of his poems contain allusions to the plight of slaves.  He was also close friends with Senator Charles Sumner, whose own fiery oratory and opposition to slavery famously put him on the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sumner#Antebellum_career_and_attack_by_Preston_Brooks"&gt;wrong side&lt;/a&gt; of a Southern cane. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;So how do we go about divining the message above from the mess of the original code?  Well, the message is explicitly in there, it's just hidden by a bunch of randomly generated letters.  To get the message out, one needs to know how the junk is distributed.  To do that we use the first hint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first hint was a list of pie fillings.  So we will need to use pi to find out how the junk is filling the message:&lt;/p&gt;

My first thought was that it would be 1/9.  There are nine non-zero numbers to choose from and they should be uniformly distributed, right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out that for almost all data sets naturally collected, this is not the case.  In most cases, one occurs as the first digit most frequently, then two, then three, etc.  That this seemingly paradoxical result should be the case is the essence of Benford's Law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Benford's Law [1] states that for most real-life lists of data, the first significant digit in the data is distributed in a specific way, namely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ P(d) = \mbox{log}_{10}\left(1 + \frac{1}{d}\right) $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probabilities for leading digits are roughly P(1) = 0.30, P(2) = 0.18, P(3) = 0.12, P(4) = 0.10, P(5) = 0.08, P(6) = 0.07, P(7) = 0.06, P(8) = 0.05, P(9) = 0.04.  So we would expect the first significant digit to be a one almost 30% of the time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But where would such a distribution come from?  Well, it turns out that it comes from a distribution that is logarithmically uniform.  We can map the interval [1,10) to the interval [0,1) by just taking a logarithm (base ten).  These logarithms are then distributed uniformly on the interval [0,1). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can now get some grasp for why one should occur as the first digit more often in a uniform log distribution.  In the figure below, I have plotted 1-10 on a logarithm scale.  In a uniform log distribution, a given point is equally likely to be found anywhere on the line.  So the probability of getting any particular first digit is just its length along that line.  Clearly, the intervals get smaller as the numbers get bigger.
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TR4s91iaKKI/AAAAAAAAAIU/uxYE4eqknCY/s1600/logscale.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TR4s91iaKKI/AAAAAAAAAIU/uxYE4eqknCY/s400/logscale.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;But we can quantify this, too.  For a first digit on the interval [1,10), the probability that the first digit is &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; is given by:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ P(d) = \frac{\mbox{log}_{10}(d+1) -\mbox{log}_{10}(d)}{\mbox{log}_{10}(10) -\mbox{log}_{10}(1)} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which is just&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ P(d) =\mbox{log}_{10}(d+1) -\mbox{log}_{10}(d) $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ P(d) = \mbox{log}_{10}\left( 1 + \frac{1}{d} \right) $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which is the distribution of Benford's Law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how well do different data sets follow Benford's Law?  I decided to test it out on a couple easily available data sets: pulsar periods, U.S. city populations, U.S. county sizes and masses of plant genomes.  Let's start first with pulsar periods.  I took 1875 pulsar periods from the ATNF Pulsar Database (found &lt;a href="http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/psrcat/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  The results are plotted below.  The bars represent the fraction of numbers that start with a given digit and the red dots are the fractions predicted by Benford's Law. 
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TRpObM6LxrI/AAAAAAAAAH8/tz9WQ98H258/s1600/benford_pulsar.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TRpObM6LxrI/AAAAAAAAAH8/tz9WQ98H258/s400/benford_pulsar.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;From this plot, we see that the pulsar period data shows the general trend of Benford's Law, but not exactly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's try U.S. city populations.  This data was taken from the U.S. census bureau from the 2009 census and contains population data for over 81,000 U.S. cities.  We see from the chart below that there is a near exact correspondence between the observed first-digit distribution and Benford's Law.
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TRpQhzrSFmI/AAAAAAAAAIA/ZP3YTbWiiM4/s1600/benford_uscities09.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TRpQhzrSFmI/AAAAAAAAAIA/ZP3YTbWiiM4/s400/benford_uscities09.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Also from the U.S. census bureau, I got the data for the land area of over 3000 U.S. counties.  These data also conform fairly well to Benford's Law.
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TRpSE9pHC1I/AAAAAAAAAII/dqG382dqoCw/s1600/benford_land.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TRpSE9pHC1I/AAAAAAAAAII/dqG382dqoCw/s400/benford_land.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Finally, I found &lt;a href="http://data.kew.org/cvalues/CvalServlet?querytype=1"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; neat website that catalogs the genome masses of over 2000 different species of plants.  I'm not totally sure &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; they do this, but it provided a ton of easy-to-access data, so why not?
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TRpR82I2X1I/AAAAAAAAAIE/XdFQozbC7eY/s1600/benford_plant.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TRpR82I2X1I/AAAAAAAAAIE/XdFQozbC7eY/s400/benford_plant.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Neat, so we see that wide variety of natural data follow Benford's Law (some more examples &lt;a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BenfordsLaw.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  But why should they?  Well, as far as I have gathered, there are a few reasons for this.  The first two come from a paper published by Jeff Boyle [2].  Boyle makes (and proves) two claims about this distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, he claims that "the log distribution [Benford's Law] is the limiting distribution when random variables are repeatedly multiplied, divided, or raised to integer powers."  Second, he claims that once such a distribution is achieved, it "persists under all further multiplications, divisions and raising to integer powers."     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since most data we accumulate (scientific, financial, gambling,...) is the result of many mathematical operations, we would expect that they would tend towards the logarithmic distribution as described by Boyle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason for why natural data should fit Benford's Law is given by Roger Pinkham (in &lt;a href="http://www.williams.edu/go/math/sjmiller/public_html/BrownClasses/197/benford/Pinkham_FirstDigit.pdf"&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;).  Pinkham proves that&lt;i&gt; "&lt;/i&gt;the only distribution for the first significant digits which is invariant under scale change of the underlying distribution" is Benford's Law.  This means that if we have some data, say the lengths of rivers in feet, it will have some distribution in the first digit.  If we require that this distribution remain the same under unit conversion (to meters, yards, cubits, ... ), the only distribution that satisfies this distribution would be the uniform logarithmic distribution of Benford's Law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This "scale-invariant" rationale for this first digit law is probably the most important when it comes to data that we actually measure.  If we find some distribution for the first digit, we would like it to be the same no matter what units we have used.  But this should also be really easy to test.  The county size data used above was given in square miles, so let's try some new units.  First, we can try square kilometers.
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TR09Vq1jCAI/AAAAAAAAAIM/1Yz5gp0-7CY/s1600/benford_landkm.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TR09Vq1jCAI/AAAAAAAAAIM/1Yz5gp0-7CY/s400/benford_landkm.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Slightly different than square miles, but still a very good fit.  Now how about square furlongs?
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TR093IwIt8I/AAAAAAAAAIQ/ern61I_MJQ0/s1600/benford_landfurlong.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TR093IwIt8I/AAAAAAAAAIQ/ern61I_MJQ0/s400/benford_landfurlong.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Neat!  Seems like the distribution holds true regardless of the units we have used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it seems like a wide range of data satisfy Benford's Law.  But is this useful in any way or is it just a statistical curiosity?  Well, it's mainly just a curiosity.  But people have found some pretty neat applications.  One field in which it has found use is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_accounting"&gt;Forensic Accounting&lt;/a&gt;, which I can only assume is a totally rad bunch of accountants that dramatically remove sunglasses as they go over tax returns.  Since certain types of financial data (for example, see &lt;a href="http://www.uic.edu/classes/actg/actg593/Readings/Auditing/The-Effective-Use-Of-Benford's-Law-To-Assist-In-Detecting-Fraud-In-Accounting-Data.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) should follow Benford's Law, inconsistencies in financial returns can be found if the data is faked or manipulated in any way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moral of the story:  If you're going to cook the books, remember Benford!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  Benford's Law, in the great tradition of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigler's_law_of_eponymy"&gt;Stigler's Law,&lt;/a&gt; was discovered by Simon Newcomb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You're sitting at a bar, bored out of your mind.  You've got an unlimited supply of pretzel rods and a lot of time to kill.  The floor is made of thin wooden planks.  How can you calculate pi? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how the problem of Buffon's needle was first presented to me.  Stated more formally the problem is this:  given a needle of length &lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt; and a floor of parallel lines separated by a distance &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;, what is the probability of a randomly dropped needle crossing a line? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Working this all out (see a derivation &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffon's_needle"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, for example), we find that the probability a needle crosses a line is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ P = \frac{2l}{d\pi} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we have a nice way of experimentally coming up with a value for pi.  Simply by tossing a bunch of needles of length &lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt; on a striped surface with lines separated by a distance &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; and counting the total number of times a needle crosses a line and the total number of throws, we can approximate the probability (and thus, pi).  I say "approximate" because it will only be true in the limit of an infinite number of throws.  Anyway, we have that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \frac{\mbox{Number of crosses}}{\mbox{Number of throws}} \approx P = \frac{2l}{\pi d} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so, rearranging a bit, we have that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \pi \approx \left( \frac{2l}{d} \right) \left(\frac{\mbox{Number of throws}}{\mbox{Number of crosses}} \right) $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have something that we can go about measuring.  I am going to define the following value to be the experimental quantity we aim to measure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \tilde{\pi} = \left( \frac{2l}{d} \right) \left(\frac{\mbox{Number of throws}}{\mbox{Number of crosses}} \right) $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now that we know what we are measuring, let's get to it!  Since I'm not allowed to use needles in my home experiments anymore, I decided to use toothpicks.  For my striped surface, I just used the wooden floor in our house (see Figure 1).  The toothpick length was almost exactly the same as the distance between lines on the floor, so we see that that the &lt;i&gt;l &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; terms cancel in our expression above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make the measurements, I threw ten toothpicks at a time onto the floor and counted how many crossed the lines.  I chose ten because it seemed like a nice number.  It was small enough that I shouldn't expect too much clumping of the toothpicks (and unwanted correlations in the data), but large enough that I didn't have to drop and pick up a single toothpick a thousand times.  I threw the groups of ten toothpicks 100 times and tallied the results.  Thus, I have 1000 throws of a single needle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took the entirety the movie &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undercover_Brother" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Undercover Brother&lt;/a&gt; to throw and pick up all those toothpicks, but when all was said and done I found that out of 1000 thrown toothpicks, 618 crossed the line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plugging this back into our equation above (and remembering &lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;), we get&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \tilde{\pi}=\left(\frac{2l}{d}\right) \left(\frac{\mbox{Number of throws}}{\mbox{Number of crosses}} \right)=2 \left(\frac{1000}{618}\right)=3.23$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well that's not too far off I guess.  But it's certainly not the pi that I know and love.  What went wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before, since I am only doing a finite number of runs here I am not finding the exact probability.  So is there anyway to gauge our uncertainty?  Sure.  Since we are doing a counting experiment with a lot of events, we can approximate our error using Poisson statistics.  For a Poisson distribution, the standard deviation is just the square root of the number of events (in this case, crosses).  So we have that our total number of crosses is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \mbox{Number of crosses} = 618 \pm \sqrt{618} = 618 \pm 24.9 $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now if we want to find the uncertainty in our final measurement, we'll have to propagate the error through.  This gives us a final value of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \tilde{\pi} = 3.23 \pm 0.13 $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and we see that the exact value of pi falls within there.  We can see that this value gets better and better if we plot our value of pi as a function of the number of throws.  Figure 2 shows the measured value of pi (with error bars) over a wide range of throw numbers.  The actual value of pi is plotted as a green line.

&lt;p&gt;Hello all and welcome to to another roundup of Problem of the Week.  If the time intervals don't seem to be adding up, just remember that "week" is an illusion here at Virtuosi headquarters.  "Problem of the Week," doubly so.  But enough with the excuses, let's see if Mr. Bond lives to Die Another Day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation presented in the problem was one of a glass of water filled all the way to the top with a single ice cube in it.  The goal is to see if any water falls to the floor as the ice cube melts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
The simplest analysis would be to just consider the displacement of water by the ice cube.  By Archimedes' principle we know that the buoyant force on the ice cube is equal to the weight of the water displaced by the ice cube.  But since the ice cube is floating, we know that the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the ice cube.  Therefore, the ice cube just displaces it's own weight in water.  So as the ice cube melts, the water level stays the same and no water is spilled over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stated a bit more explicitly, we have that the buoyant force is the weight of the displaced water:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ F_b = m_{water}g = {\rho}_{water}V_{water}g $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where we have just expressed the mass of the water as the density of water times the volume of the water displaced.  Likewise, the weight of the ice cube is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ W_{ice} = m_{ice}g = {\rho}_{ice}V_{ice}g $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But since the ice cube is floating, the buoyant force is equal to the weight.  Setting the above equations equal to each other and rearranging a bit, we can solve for the volume of the water displaced by the ice cube:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ V_{water} = \frac{{\rho}_{ice}V_{ice}}{{\rho}_{water}} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great, now we have the volume of water that the ice cube displaced, so now we just need to see what volume of water the ice cube will add once it melts.  Since we know that the mass of ice cube better be the same as the mass of the water left after it melts, we can write&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ {\rho}_{ice}V_{ice} = {\rho}_{water}V_{water} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which gives that the total volume of the water  is just&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;$$ V_{water} = \frac{{\rho}_{ice}V_{ice}}{{\rho}_{water}} $$&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;which is exactly the same volume we found before.  Therefore, when the ice cube melts it fills up exactly the same amount of volume as the water displaced to hold up the ice cube, so the water level remains the same and James Bond lives!&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Or does he?  Well, he sure does if the system is entirely described by the analysis above.  But we need to be exact here since a single drop would set off the Koala death trap.  We have considered the biggest contributions to the change of volume of the water (and easiest to calculate!), but we have ignored a large number of much much smaller effects on the volume.  Typically these effects would be swept aside and callously labeled "negligible," but since even the smallest change of volume could mean life or death for our hero, they must be accounted for to give a final "exact" answer.  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Unfortunately, "exact" isn't something science can do very well.  We can only do as good as the measurements we make allow.  And since I gave you practically no information, this was very tough.  However, one could consider the magnitude of the effects given typical values and see which side wins out.  But if two competing effects give similar values under reasonable conditions, it becomes very difficult to give an answer.  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;The last two "Problems of the Week" were well posed math problems, each with a clear-cut "correct" answer.  This one was a physics problem and physics is a lot messier than math.  That may initially seem less satisfying, but it means that there is a whole lot of interesting "mess" to sort out!  I really enjoyed reading the &lt;a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/11/problem-of-week-3.html#more"&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt; detailing all the neat small effects to the change of volume that I ignored in my solution.  Density variations as a function of temperature, surface tension effects, evaporation and thermal expansion all play some role in determining the final answer.   There's a whole lot of interesting physics going on!  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Without knowing the exact conditions a bit more and doing a whole lot more work, it seems as though I will not be able to provide a final physics solution.  But, having seen just about every Bond movie, I can give an answer with a certainty not afforded to me by science:  Mr. Bond lives.  How do I know this?  Well, it is common knowledge that James Bond has tiny smoke grenades in the soles of his shoes that release a potent koala knock-out potion specifically created by Q.  So Bond releases these into the koala death pit, rendering the vicious beasts harmless.  Then he uses his watch laser to cut any bindings Dr. Cherrycoke may have placed him in, falling into the death pit.  The fall leaves Mr. Bond uninjured, as a cuddly mass of sleeping koalas break his fall.  By stacking the koalas into a rudimentary series of steps, Mr. Bond ascends out of the death pit and free to save the world's ice supply from the evil Dr. Cherrycoke.       &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here at the Virtuosi, we have a very specific way of asking a very specific type of question that sounds anything but specific.  These are the "How come [blank]?" questions [1].  These are very simple questions that just about every four year old asks, but likely never get sufficiently answered.  To  get a feel for what I mean by these questions I provide the following translations of problems we have either considered or will consider:
&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;Q:  How come trees?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;Translation:  How tall can trees be?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;Q:  How come plants?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;Translation:  Why are plants green?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;These are my very favorite types of questions because they are completely understandable by everyone and promise to have very interesting physics working behind the scenes.  So I've been thrilled to see two such questions considered by scientists lately that have also had a good run  in popular media.  They are:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;Q:  How come cats?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;Translation:  How do cats drink?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;Q:  How come dogs?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;Translation:  How do dogs shake?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
The question of how cats drink was &lt;a href="http://web.mit.edu/preis/www/mypapers/cats_Science_Express_Reis_Aristoff_Stocker.pdf"&gt;answered&lt;/a&gt; recently by a few dudes from MIT, Virginia Tech and Princeton.  One morning, one of the guys was just watching his cat drink water and realized he couldn't immediately figure out how it worked, so he decided to do a bit more research and BAM! science happens.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It turns out that the cat isn't just scooping up the water with it tongue as one would probably have expected.  Instead the cat uses its tongue to effectively punch the water, drawing up a column of fluid.  They then bite this column and get a very itty bitty kitty mouthful of water.  Here it is in a slow motion video I stole from the Washington Post who stole it from Reuters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(You'll probably have to sit through an ad, apologies)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TOAVxjml42I/AAAAAAAAAHc/06dcbYUsowM/s1600/12cats_graphic-popup-v2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="232" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TOAVxjml42I/AAAAAAAAAHc/06dcbYUsowM/s400/12cats_graphic-popup-v2.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a cat person?  Well there was also a study done a month or so ago about dog shaking.  If you have a dog, you have almost certainly experienced the elegant way in which a wet dog un-wettafies itself.  Well, a few students at Georgia Tech were also familiar with this shaking and just happened to have a super high speed camera that could track water droplets.  I assume it only took a short period of time to put two and two together and BAM! science happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing the logical extension of the "spherical cow" joke to "dog of radius R", the study also found some fairly surprising results.  If we are spinning a wet cylinder (i.e. dog), we would assume that the water is held on by some "sticking force."  Then to shake off these droplets, we'd assume that the dog would have to shake fast enough that the centrifugal force would overcome the sticking force.  In other equations,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ F_{centrifugal} = m{\omega}^2 R $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ F_{sticking} = C $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we would then expect the shaking frequency to be the frequency that gets those two guys to equal each other.  We would thus predict&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;$${\omega} \sim R^{-0.5} $$&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;where the little squiggle just means that the frequency scales as the radius to the -0.5 power, with some constant multipliers out front that we don't know so we just ignore.  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;But this is not what the Ga Tech guys observed!  Check out the video below:&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;object height="385" width="480"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/kvoKN1UfLn0?fs=1&amp;amp;hl=en_US"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/kvoKN1UfLn0?fs=1&amp;amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there's still something else going on that wasn't in our simple model.  But this is what makes science so exciting!  Even something dogs and cats figured out long ago can have some really rich and interesting physics.  So keep on asking those questions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  Interestingly enough, the first "How come [blank]?" questions we asked did not have the now canonical form.  Instead, it was stated as "Why are cows?".  After much deliberation, we found that the solution is "Because milkshakes."  Fair enough.  &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="scott bakula"></category><category term="hello kitty"></category></entry><entry><title>Beards and Pulsars</title><link href="http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/beards-and-pulsars.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-09-28T02:56:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Corky</name></author><id>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2010-09-28:posts/beards-and-pulsars.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TKF59ueq6-I/AAAAAAAAAHM/-dRSw4CNM3w/s1600/hulse_postcard.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TKF59ueq6-I/AAAAAAAAAHM/-dRSw4CNM3w/s200/hulse_postcard.jpg" width="141" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;The bearded half of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;Hulse-Taylor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;A few weeks ago I was on a bus going through Scranton and I read a super-awesome fun fact regarding the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;Black Holes, White Dwarfs and Neutron Stars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;.  Sadly, I have since forgotten it and left the book a few thousand miles away.  So, let's just make up our own!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt; First, we need a little background.  What the heck is a pulsar?  A pulsar is a rapidly rotating neutron star that beams electromagnetic radiation towards us, which is how we can see them.  Typical rotation periods range from a millisecond to a few seconds.  So each time the pulsar rotates, we observe a blip when the radiation beams towards us.  Since these objects are additionally very stable rotators, they are essentially very accurate clocks with which we may make astronomical measurements.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;So what's the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar?  The Hulse-Taylor binary is almost exactly what it sounds like: it's a pulsar binary where one of the pulsars is pointed towards earth.  It was the first binary of it's kind discovered and offers a unique look into a very high gravity environment.  It also provided a very nice test for General Relativity.  General Relativity predicts that two orbiting massive bodies should emit gravitational waves.  This emission of gravitational waves will then cause the orbit to decay and the two bodies to move closer together.  So does the Hulse-Taylor binary show this?  Take a look:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TKF5SwXxsXI/AAAAAAAAAHI/wPELMEGlWW0/s1600/PSR_1913_new_large.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TKF5SwXxsXI/AAAAAAAAAHI/wPELMEGlWW0/s400/PSR_1913_new_large.jpg" width="331" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;The data fit the prediction of general relativity perfectly!  For this discovery Hulse and Taylor shared the 1993 Nobel prize in Physics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that's all well and good, but I was promised some fun facts...?  Ah, yes!  Well, we mentioned that the Hulse-Taylor binary orbit is decaying.  It turns out that the orbit is decaying at about 3.5 meters per year.  That's pretty slow.  Let's put it into a more conventional speed, like meters per second.  So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ 3.5 m/yr = 3.5 m/yr \times \frac{1 year}{3.14 \times 10^7 s} = 1.1 \times 10^{-7} m/s $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or, in less useful units,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ 3.5 m/yr = 110 nm/s $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great, so what to compare this to?  Well, all people who are in the know know that I am a manly man who gained the ability to grow facial hair sometime after my sophomore year of college.  And since I have to pretend to be an upstanding member of society this week, I happen to know the last time I shaved.  Thus, a few simple measurements and I can estimate how long hair takes to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time I shaved was three days ago and a quick eyeball measurement (sadly I have no ruler) gives a facial hair length of about 2mm.  Thus, a beard grows at about 0.7 mm/ day.                                 &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ 0.7 mm/day = 0.7 mm/day \times \frac{10^{-3} m}{mm} \times \frac{1 day}{86400s} = 8 nm/s $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a universal speed constant, which we shall call the speed of beard.  Or, bowing to our oppressive overload sponsors*, we shall call it "Gillette Mach 1."  So doing a quick division, we find that the rate at which the Hulse-Taylor binary's orbit is shrinking is roughly 14 times beard speed, or in our commercial units, Gillette Mach 14 (a razor close shave!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Well," I hear you cry (a bit disappointed...?), "that's          &lt;/span&gt;  &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;pretty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt; useless unit, but can't we be &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;more&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt; useless?"  Yes, dear reader, we certainly can!  We are currently at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xZp-GLMMJ0"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;Snuggie&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ym65h1bmJ0"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;levels of uselessness right now, but I think we can just about bump it up to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ONJfp95yoE"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;Member of Congress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt; useless if we try.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;
A furlong is a unit of length about 200 meters long.  A fortnight is a unit of time about 14 days long.  Therefore, if we want a speed we just...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \frac{furlong}{fortnight} = 1 \frac{furlong}{fortnight} \times \frac{200 m}{furlong} \times \frac{1 fortnight}{14 \times 86400 s} = 1.6 \times 10^{-4} \frac{m}{s} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;So the rate of decay of the Hulse-Taylor binary is:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ 3.5 \frac{m}{yr} = 1.1 \times 10^{-7} m/s \times \frac{1 furlong/fortnight}{ 1.6 \times 10^{-4} m/s} = 7 \times 10^{-4} \frac{furlong}{fortnight} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;Hooray!  So now we know the decay rate of the Hulse-Taylor binary orbit in two horrible units: either 700 microfurlongs per fortnight or 14 times the speed of beard (AKA Gillette Mach 14).  Please write these in your copybooks now and forever commit them to memory.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;

&lt;i&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We descend to the bottom of the abandoned mineshaft recently converted to the headquarters of General Stanley K. Ripper.  He is currently engaged in a heated discussion with his science advisor, Dr. Vontavious Dre.  We join mid-sentence as a result of lazy writing...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

DRE:  Good question.  Essentially what we get is the differential change in the space-time interval ( ds ) if we change all the coordinates by a very tiny little bit.  What is nice about this is that although coordinates are a tricky thing in general relativity and can change from one observer to another, the space-time interval is an invariant quantity.  That is, different observers will measure the same space-time interval between events even though they may measure different times and distances.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

DRE:  Right-o.  And this invariance allows us to compare different reference frames.  Eventually, we will use this invariance to get the frequencies observed by an observer on the surface of the earth and one traveling along with a satellite in orbit.  Since we will only be considering observers at fixed radius and fixed theta = 90 degrees (ie at the equator), we can simplify things a bit.

[1]  Thanks to Tom from &lt;a href="http://blogs.scienceforums.net/swansont/"&gt;Swans on Tea&lt;/a&gt; (one of my favorite physics blogs) for fixing a mistake for me.  I had initially done the calculation assuming the satellite was in a geosynchronous orbit (about 42,000 km) and got a time delay of 48 microseconds.  As it turns out, the GPS satellites are really at an orbit of about 26,000 km, which gives a time delay of 38 microseconds.  I have made the appropriate changes and the calculations now reflect this more accurate value.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;

our experiment&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"&gt;When you strike a bell, it rings at a given frequency.  This frequency is called the resonant frequency and is the natural frequency at which the bell likes to ring.  Just about anything that can shake, rattle, or oscillate will have a resonant frequency.  Things like quartz crystals, wine glasses, and suspension bridges all have a resonant frequency.  The quartz crystals oscillate at frequencies high enough for accurate timekeeping in watches, the wine glasses at audible frequencies to make boring dinners more interesting, and bridges at low enough frequencies that you can feel it when you walk.  It is the resonant frequency of bridges that we decided to measure.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 13px;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 13px;"&gt;To make our measurements, we "borrowed" Yariv's fancy phone.  One of the nice things about fancy new phones is that most of them have internal accelerometers to detect motion.  You can do a whole bunch of fun experiments and take some pretty good data with these accelerometers (see, for example, physicist and TV star Rhett Allain's posts over at &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/dotphysics/iphone/"&gt;dot physics&lt;/a&gt;).  Placing Yariv's phone on the suspension footbridge on campus, Alemi, Matt and I took data and confused passers-by for about 15 minutes.       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 13px;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"&gt;The accelerometer in the phone measures acceleration in three coordinate directions: x is along the width of the bridge, y is along the length of the bridge, and z is up and down.  The raw data is shown below.  The z data is shown in blue, and x and y in green and red.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 13px;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TGNrbHEsuvI/AAAAAAAAAGA/4WyG8OuNww0/s1600/bridge_rawtime.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TGNrbHEsuvI/AAAAAAAAAGA/4WyG8OuNww0/s400/bridge_rawtime.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The first thing you'll notice about this data is that the z direction (blue) has big spikes in it around 180s, 300s, and 800s.  The biggest spikes are when Alemi and I jumped up and down to ring the bridge.  The smaller bumps in the blue data are the result of people walking or jogging by.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;With the raw acceleration data and knowledge of the sample rate of the accelerometer ( 90 Hz ), we can Fourier transform it to get frequencies.  Doing this to the raw data for each dimension we get the following spectrograms.  Each of the spectrograms illustrates how much of each frequency is present at each point in time.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The most relevant direction for us is the z direction.  We see that at several points there are strong signals at all frequencies followed by longer periods where the main signal is around 1 Hz.  These events correspond to when Alemi and I jumped up and down and are analogous to ringing a bell.  The striking of the bell is just a sharp impulse (roughly a delta function) which is composed of all frequencies.  Soon after the impulse, all of the frequencies die out except for the resonant frequency, which keeps on ringing.  Just looking at this graph, it looks like the bridge resonant frequency is around 1 Hz.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TGNvFsSzqGI/AAAAAAAAAGI/m2Tr3GwM1qM/s1600/bridge_Zspec.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TGNvFsSzqGI/AAAAAAAAAGI/m2Tr3GwM1qM/s400/bridge_Zspec.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We can also make similar graphs for the x and y directions.  Remember, the x direction is the width of the bridge and the y direction is the length of the bridge.  Although there is less motion in these directions, the spikes where we jumped and people walked by are still clearly visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TGNxb8WcJMI/AAAAAAAAAGY/tLPA6SbyyeE/s1600/bridge_Xspec.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TGNxb8WcJMI/AAAAAAAAAGY/tLPA6SbyyeE/s400/bridge_Xspec.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TGNxNPkNSTI/AAAAAAAAAGQ/3Xkx2WKFv6w/s1600/bridge_Yspec.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TGNxNPkNSTI/AAAAAAAAAGQ/3Xkx2WKFv6w/s400/bridge_Yspec.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Finally, we can find out how much of a particular frequency is in the whole signal.  To do this we take find the power spectrum density of the entire data set (blue is z, green is x and red is y).  The ringdown frequency of about 1 Hz we saw in the spectrograms above after the jumps is illustrated in this graph as the first blue peak.  There are also some other peaks at around 15 Hz, 25 Hz and 35 Hz.  I am not sure what they correspond to.     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TGNyNOZDLEI/AAAAAAAAAGg/a3eLidFVn3Y/s1600/bridge_psd.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TGNyNOZDLEI/AAAAAAAAAGg/a3eLidFVn3Y/s400/bridge_psd.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To clean up this a bit, we can just take the data without the jumps in it.  Computing a new power spectrum density with just the data from about 400s - 700s, we get the following graph, which also displays a fairly prominent peak around 1 Hz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TGcYbMuUbTI/AAAAAAAAAGo/v2d2bMQNsoE/s1600/psd.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TGcYbMuUbTI/AAAAAAAAAGo/v2d2bMQNsoE/s400/psd.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it seems that there is definitely something going on around 1 Hz.  Initially, I was worried that this is just the rate at which people walk and therefore it was just showing up because we had people walking the whole time.  However, the strong 1 Hz signal after each ringing in each z spectrogram seems to indicate that it is intrinsic to the bridge.  Therefore, it seems as though the resonant frequency in the z direction of the bridge is about 1 Hz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don't take our word for it.

As an obvious effect of the selection bias involved with including this superfluous information in technical books, they are bound to be pretty interesting.  Such stories range from the hilarious antics of Feynman [1] or Fermi [2], to the heartbreaking stories of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Boltzmann#Final_years"&gt;Boltzmann&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppenheimer_security_hearing"&gt;Oppenheimer&lt;/a&gt;, and even to the surprisingly scandalous life o&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;f Erwin &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;Schrödinger.  But my all time favorite of all these historical "fun facts" is that of the man who provided the first exact solution to the Einstein field equations while fighting in the First World War:  Karl Schwarzschild (pictured left impersonating a surprised walrus [3]).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;Karl Schwarzschild was an astronomer, physicist and mathematician; an across the board physical scientist with passions both abstract and practical.  He published his first article regarding the orbits of double stars at the age of 16 while still in high school.  He went on to work on the mathematical treatment of orbits, constructed several useful astronomical instruments, and put forward theoretical treatments of comet tails and stellar atmospheres.  His creativity was admired by some of the greatest scientists of his era.  Eddington, chief among them, offered his praise in a strangely brutal simile [4]:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;"... his joy was to range unrestricted over the pastures of knowledge, and, like a guerrilla leader, his attacks fell where they were least expected."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;But Schwarzschild's greatest contribution to science was finding the first exact solution to Einstein's field equations for general relativity in 1916.  This solution, which takes the form of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_metric"&gt;Schwarzschild metric&lt;/a&gt;, describes the space-time surrounding a non-rotating spherically symmetric object (the solution for a rotating spherically symmetric object was found in 1963 by Roy Kerr).  It was through this metric that I came to meet Schwarzschild, since every time it is introduced in a class the instructor is sure to drop the mother of all fun facts: Schwarzschild discovered his solution while in the army during World War I, a war that would eventually kill him (among others).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;In this age of Wikipedia, I find it hard to believe that I didn't immediately go home and check the full story behind this statement.  I may very well have, but over the years I have constructed a myth about the death of Schwarzschild that I at least half believed until I finally looked up the full story for this post.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;I imagined Schwarzschild as the noble and peaceful scientist immediately skeptical of the war, but eventually conscripted to fight.  There he fought on the front lines, carrying both a Mauser and a notebook.  He would spend the long lulls between suicidal assaults through no-man's-land huddled down in the mud in the trenches scribbling away like mad at what would eventually become the elegant solution that bears his name.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;Then (and here I will blatantly plagiarize the &lt;i&gt;All Quiet on the Western Front &lt;/i&gt;movie) Schwarzschild began to see the solution, everything started to fall in place.  He became excited and no longer able to sit still.  Now standing, he reached out towards the beauty of nature he saw not in a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShscVNkUmy0"&gt;butterfly&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJcBC2Am-uU"&gt;bluebird&lt;/a&gt;, but in the fabric of space-time.  Just as he finishes his solution, Schwarzschild's head briefly peaks above the trench and is caught by a sniper's bullet.  Both he and his notebook fall to the mud unnoticed, an overly romanticized symbol for the futility of war or some such nonsense.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;Now this version is obviously false (how did he get the solution to anyone?), but it is the one that has persisted in my mind grapes.  So what really happened?  When &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQkaD6fG8mk"&gt;war were declared&lt;/a&gt; in 1914, Schwarzschild volunteered for the German army and manned weather stations and calculated missile trajectories in France, Belgium, and Russia.  It was in Russia that he discovered and published his well-known results in relativity as well as a derivation of the Stark effect using the 'old' quantum mechanics.  It was also in Russia that he began to struggle with pemphigus, an autoimmune disease where the body starts attacking its own cells.  He was sent home, where he died in 1916 at the age of 42.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;The reality is much more sensible than my version, and still a good tale in its own right: a brilliant scientist cut down in his prime, working until the very end.  So why did I unconsciously elevate a respectable tale to one of mythical proportions?  I think it has something to do with how we view the great scientists of the past.  Since they were extraordinary at one thing (some scientific field), we assume they must have been extraordinary in every regard.  Therefore, their fates must carry some deeper meaning or symbolism.  But it turns out that the reality, while certainly less romantic, may be more satisfying (to some), that these men and women whose names live on tied to equations were just regular people who happened to be very good at one thing: being scientists.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;Or maybe it's just my inability to separate movies from real life.  Who knows?  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;

Or for all you pinko commies and poor grad students there are two free options.  One, assemble approximately one gaggle of undergrad physics majors or Virtuosi bloggers and proceed to give them the shakedown, at least one copy should pop out.

Over the course of two semesters Alemi and I have deposited roughly the equivalent of the GDP of, say, Monaco to this very same Pepsi machine (see left, with most of Landau and Lifshitz to scale).  It just so happens that Pepsi is now having a contest, called "Caps for Caps," in which it is possible to win a baseball hat.  There are several nice things about this contest.  Firstly, I drink a lot of soda.  Secondly, I like baseball hats.  So far so good.  Lastly (and most important for this post), is that it is fairly straightforward to calculate the statistics of winning (or at least simulate them).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Well, on each soda cap the name of a Major League Baseball team is printed.  All thirty teams are (supposedly) printed with the same frequency, so the odds of getting any particular team are 1/30.  You can win a hat by collecting three caps with the same team printed on them.  So if I had five caps, the following would be a win:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;In addition, one in eight caps gets you 15% off on some $50 dollar or more purchase to MLB.com or something like that.  For simplicity, I ignored these 15% off guys, but all they will do is push back the number of caps you need by one for every eight purchased.  It should not be too difficult to factor these ones in, but I was lazy and I already made all these nice graphs, so...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;

I wrote a little Python script that randomly generates a team for each cap and counts my wins over a given number of caps purchased.  Running this about 100,000 times for all number of caps between 1 and 61 (with 61 guaranteed to win) and averaging over the number of wins, I could determine both the expected number of wins per cap value and the probability of winning at least once.  The results are shown below.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; text-align: left;"&gt;But we can also exactly solve this game.  This turned out to take longer for me (I'm bad at probability) than just simulating the darn thing.  I had initially included my derivation in the post but it was long, muddled, and none too illuminating, so I took it out.  But I super-duper promise I did it and can post if you really really want to know.  Otherwise, I have just plotted the predicted results below (as a red curve) along with the simulated data (blue dots).  Turns out they agree pretty well!&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; text-align: left;"&gt;Just eyeballing the graph, we see that after 18 or 19 sodas the chances of winning are about a half.  Beyond about 25 or so it appears to be almost 90% that you'll win at least once.  In reality, these percentages would occur about 2 or 3 caps later to compensate for the 15% off thingies.  So now that we have some numbers and can trust our model a bit, let's see how worth it this contest is for us.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; text-align: left;"&gt;First, we can ask: Is this a good way to get a hat cheaper than retail value (about $15)?  To quantify "worth it" I have chosen to find the value of winnings (price of hat times expected number of wins) minus the cost of caps (how much I spend on soda).  I am fairly embarrassed to say that the cost of each soda is $1.75.  See plot below.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; text-align: center;"&gt;   &lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TAxzBhvw-4I/AAAAAAAAAFQ/RiKEfFBDqig/s1600/ValueDifferential.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TAxzBhvw-4I/AAAAAAAAAFQ/RiKEfFBDqig/s400/ValueDifferential.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; text-align: left;"&gt;From this plot, we see that it doesn't become "worth it" (that is, value of winnings is greater than cost of sodas) until about 40 sodas purchased.  That's a lot!  In fact, we see that just when I start feeling pretty confident I'll win something (around 20-25 sodas), I'm right in a big valley of "totally not worth it."  So if I just want a baseball hat, I'm better off forking over the $15 dollars.     &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; text-align: left;"&gt;Although, one does see from this plot that once I get above about 40 or so sodas, it becomes much more cost effective to just keep buying sodas and winning hats.  However, Pepsi tries to stifle this a bit in the &lt;a href="http://www.pepsiusa.com/capsforcaps/"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: blue;"&gt;rules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, stating&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt; that "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;Limit one (1) Official MLB® baseball cap per name, address or household."  Unless I either make a lot of friends real soon or develop a creative definition of my address, it looks like I'm out of luck.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This contest, like many others, needs to have a "No Purchase Necessary" clause for some legal reason or another (so they aren't lotteries or gambling or something).  I had assumed they (the nameless overlords at Pepsi) would limit the number of caps possible from just mailing in, but it doesn't seem that way.  From the Official rules, Chapter Two, &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;verses nine to twenty-one:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

So we can redo our cost analysis with the cost of getting one cap as the cost of a stamp.  Putting the value of a cap now at the cost of a stamp (44 cents), we get the following: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; text-align: left;"&gt;Hey, that seems worth it!  And it should, since from above we saw that the probability of winning after about 30 caps was in the high 90% 's.  The cost of getting 30 caps this way is the cost of 30 stamps, which is less than the $15 that the hat is (supposedly) worth.  So if I really wanted a hat from this contest and didn't feel like drinking all my money away, I'd just send away for the mail-in pieces.          &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; text-align: left;"&gt;I may try this method, since it seems to be allowed under the rules.  Although, even a strict constructionist reading of the contest rules pretty much allows Pepsi to do whatever the heck it wants.  Either way, I'll be sure to update to see how well my model holds up!&lt;/div&gt;

Apparently the snow was a temporary fixture that covered real live grass.  Neato, gang!  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;
The joy at seeing green grass led quickly to surprise, confusion and then anger.  Why the heck is grass green?  Well, things look a color when they reflect back that color.  So grass is green because its pigments (chlorophyll) absorb only a certain range of the visible spectrum, reflecting back the greenish bits.  But if I know anything about approximating the sun as a blackbody, I know that it has a peak output of around 550 nm (i.e. green) light.  So what's going on?  Why are plants blatantly rejecting the most abundant kind of light?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;Since my initial confusion rested on the assumption of the sun as a blackbody, I decided to take a closer look at the actual spectrum of the sun.  Below is a graph showing the frequency dependence of solar radiation incident on the top of the atmosphere and at sea level.  Since plants typically don't live in space, we are most concerned with the sea level plot.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_xmXr6HTaI/AAAAAAAAACw/weKj6XTaf4M/s1600/Solar_Spectrum.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="297" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_xmXr6HTaI/AAAAAAAAACw/weKj6XTaf4M/s400/Solar_Spectrum.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;From this plot, it looks like the incident radiation from the sun is fairly level beyond about 450nm or so.  Just going on this graph alone, it looks like plants could just absorb reddish light and do alright for themselves.  But do they?  Let's take a look at the absorption spectrum of chlorophyll.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;
As it turns out there are a bunch of different "flavors" of chlorophyll  (chlorophyll a, b, c, and d).  As far as I could gather, only a and b are important (a is found in just about everything that plays the photosynthesis game and b is found in plants and green algae).  So we need to find the absorption spectrum of chlorophyll a and b.  After looking for a while at very qualitative drawings, I found this &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://omlc.ogi.edu/spectra/PhotochemCAD/html/alpha.html"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;neato-toledo site&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;, which actually gives real live data.  Plotting the results, we get the figure below. &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_xpZIEtjkI/AAAAAAAAAC4/B7RknYpI63w/s1600/chlorophyll.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_xpZIEtjkI/AAAAAAAAAC4/B7RknYpI63w/s400/chlorophyll.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;Comparing with our handy dandy wavelength-to-color converter below we see that there is a big peak in absorption of both chlorophyll a and b in the dark blue and lesser peaks in the red.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_xqlbrKz0I/AAAAAAAAADA/fsx_JmlD5Ks/s1600/spectrum.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_xqlbrKz0I/AAAAAAAAADA/fsx_JmlD5Ks/s320/spectrum.gif" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;So how do these absorption lines correspond to the incident light at sea level given above.  Well, its kind of tough to check by eye, but it looks like chlorophyll has its biggest peaks right below the plateau in the solar spectrum.  Marking the wavelengths of the absorption peaks makes this clear (a = blue, b = green).  It seems like plants are using a sub-optimal band of the spectrum!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_xrLFfWBXI/AAAAAAAAADI/NwShTicac9A/s1600/solarwithchlorphyll.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="295" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_xrLFfWBXI/AAAAAAAAADI/NwShTicac9A/s400/solarwithchlorphyll.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;So how do we reconcile this?  Well, let's first start at The Beginning.  The first photosynthetic organisms developed and spent the first billion or so years of their existence living and evolving in the oceans.  The solar spectrum we have been using so far has been accurate only in air at sea level.  Presumably it would be favorable for the organism to be able to survive at some finite depth in the ocean and not merely at the surface.  Thus we must consider the effects of water on our incident solar radiation.  A plot of the absorption spectrum of water is shown below (note the log-log scale).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_xwl48ZUSI/AAAAAAAAADQ/kPVlOauL1o4/s1600/water+absorption.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="282" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_xwl48ZUSI/AAAAAAAAADQ/kPVlOauL1o4/s400/water+absorption.gif" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;Lo and behold, the minimum absorption of visible light in water occurs towards the far end in the blue.  And this is exactly where our biggest absorption peak in of chlorophyll is!  Comparing our two graphs we see that the ratio of incident blue light to incident green light at see level is at worst about a third.  But we see that for each meter traveled in water, green light is absorbed almost ten times more than blue light.  Thus, an organism that lives a few meters underwater and wants to harness solar energy would probably do best to focus on that blue light.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;
[WARNING: The next bit is speculative and I haven't taken a bio class since high school]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;
As much as I gather about chlorophyll from Wikipedia and other semi-reputable sites, chlorophyll a is found in just about anything that photosynthesizes, BUT chlorophyll b is only found in plants and green algae.  And apparently, land plants are largely descended from green algae (which are aquatic, but typically around the surface and around the shoreline).  Now take a look at the chlorophyll absorption spectra again.  The chlorophyll b spectrum is sort of squished in more towards the middle (towards 550 nm maybe?) than chlorophyll a.  In fact, on the graph where I have drawn lines on the solar spectra graph where the chlorophyll peaks are, we see that chlorophyll b just barely gets up to that plateau region.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;
This suggests to me that chlorophyll a was working just fine for the early aquatic plants, but once they reached land and got out of all that water it became an advantage to utilize light closer to the peak solar output.  Thus, plants that had chlorophyll b in addition to a had a slight advantage over their b-less brethren.  Or so I shall continue to shamelessly speculate (and, apparently, alliterate).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;
Anyway, I thought that was kind of cool, but if I have made some horrible error or mangled some biology, please let me know!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="scott bakula"></category><category term="chlorophyll more like borophyll"></category></entry><entry><title>Solar Sails III (because two just isn't enough)</title><link href="http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/solar-sails-iii-because-two-just-isn-t-enough-.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-05-17T22:24:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Corky</name></author><id>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2010-05-17:posts/solar-sails-iii-because-two-just-isn-t-enough-.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_IKFerS7nI/AAAAAAAAACo/DPNAyMeuMaQ/s1600/leezle+pon+justice.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 169px; height: 320px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_IKFerS7nI/AAAAAAAAACo/DPNAyMeuMaQ/s320/leezle+pon+justice.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5472447586458857074" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;One thing that I've wanted to quantify since reading &lt;i&gt;Intelligent Life in the Universe&lt;/i&gt;, an outstanding book by Carl Sagan and I.S. Shklovskii, is the idea of exogenesis.  Exogenesis is the hypothesis that life formed elsewhere in the universe and was somehow transferred to earth in the form of some small seed or spore.  Now since E.T. E. coli presumably do not have little tiny jetpacks or other means of active transport, they would need to traverse the cosmos in some passive way.  One such way would be solar sailing.     &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Way back in Solar Sails I, we derived equations describing the maximum speeds and time-of-travel for various distances for a given solar sail.  Each of these equations was a function of the surface mass density of the sail, which is just the amount of mass per unit cross-sectional area.  All we need to know is the cross-sectional area and mass of a given object and we can apply these equations to just about anything!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Assume we have some spherical blob with the density of water (1g/cm^3).  The effective sigma of this blob would just be the mass divided by the cross-sectional area.  In other words,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \sigma = \frac{m}{Area} = \frac{\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \rho}{\pi r^2} = \frac{4}{3}\rho r .$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Rearranging to get r in terms of the other variables, we have &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ r = \frac{3\sigma}{4\rho} . $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Plugging in our density of 1g/cm^3 and a suitable sigma (10^-4 g/cm^2), we get&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ r \le 0.75 \times 10^{-4} cm = 0.75 \mu m .$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Check out &lt;a href="http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/begin/cells/scale/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; fun site to see what kind of critters can fit in this blob.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;From the previous post, we saw that for a sigma of 10^-4 g/cm^2, our sail would get to the nearest stars on a timescale of order 10,000 years.  Thus if our blob has a radius of less than about a micron, it could spread to hundreds of stars in around 10,000-100,000 years.  Even if it would take millions of years, that would be almost no time at all on the cosmic scale.   Just based on this calculation it all seems fairly feasible.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In making these calculations I have neglected several important aspects of the problem.  First, in no way have I actually calculated any sort of probability of this happening.  Additionally, I would have to see how likely it is for some blob to reach planetary escape velocity (presumably just by riding that tail of the Boltzmann distribution).   Finally, and perhaps most important of all, I have not given any sort of motivation or mechanism by which some living body could survive hundreds of thousands of years in the vacuum of space with constant radiation exposure.  But I have heard that some forms of life are totally &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremophile"&gt;extreme&lt;/a&gt; (especially if they drink &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Dew"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Even though such a process seems possible, it certainly doesn't seem like the easiest way to get life on earth.  I prefer the much more satisfying "amino acids + lightning + magic = &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt;" model.  But it does offer some interesting possibilities.  Suppose we as people think that people are super awesome and therefore people should be everywhere.  We do some bio magic and put whatever DNA we want into viruses, which we then pack into as many micron spheres as we can make.  We then point them at the nearest stars and have them disperse.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What would the probabilities be that they land somewhere habitable?  Are there any ethical considerations in doing this?  Is it a galactic faux pas?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="exogenesis"></category><category term="solar sails"></category><category term="scott bakula"></category><category term="do the dew"></category></entry><entry><title>Solar Sails II</title><link href="http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/solar-sails-ii.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-05-17T01:15:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Corky</name></author><id>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2010-05-17:posts/solar-sails-ii.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;[NOTE: In my hurry to make up for weeks of non-posts, I managed to almost immediately knock Nic's &lt;a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/05/why-black-holes-from-large-hadron.html"&gt;first post&lt;/a&gt; from the top of the page.   It's got the LHC, black holes, and about 3 full cups of metric awesome, so make sure you check it out (after reading this one, of course).]  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;Last time we did some calculations on how fast and far our solar sails can go, but those calculations were just for the sail itself.   If you are going to do any science with it, you're going to need a payload.  Let's take it a step further and make it an actual spaceship (with people and everything!)&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_DXvcSsDXI/AAAAAAAAACg/jK_N-B4mOME/s1600/ssradius.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Comparing it with a typical people-carrying space hotel (the International Space Station), let's give our payload a mass of 300,000 kg.   Remembering from the last post that a sigma of less that about 10^-4 g/cm^2 gave fairly nice results, we can make an effective sigma of our payload carrying sail as&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \sigma_{eff} = \frac{m_{total}}{Area} = \frac{m_s + m_p}{Area}, $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;where m_s is the mass of the sail and m_p is the mass of our payload (the ship).  Assuming the sail has some surface density of sigma and the sail is circular with some radius r, we have&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \sigma_{eff} = \frac{\pi r^2 {\sigma}_s + m_p}{\pi r^2} = {\sigma}_s + \frac{m_p}{\pi r^2} . $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now we can find the radius of our sail such that &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \sigma_{eff}  \le 10^{-4} \frac{g}{{cm}^2}. $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Rearranging our equation above and solving for radius, we find that &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ r \ge \left[\frac{m_p}{\pi \left( 10^{-4}\frac{g}{cm^2} - \sigma_s \right)} \right]^{1/2} cm. $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Below is a plot of sail radius (in meters) against sail surface density (g/cm^2).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_DXvcSsDXI/AAAAAAAAACg/jK_N-B4mOME/s1600/ssradius.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_DXvcSsDXI/AAAAAAAAACg/jK_N-B4mOME/s400/ssradius.png" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5472110757303553394" style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 179px; " /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
From this plot, we see that we will need our sail radius to be AT LEAST 10 km and the surface density of our sail must be less than 10^-4 g/cm^2.   Now that's a big sail, but it's not obscenely big (depending, of course, on your definitions of obscenity).   One could certainly imagine such a sail being built, but it would be an impressive engineering feat.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So get to work engineers!  I've already made a whole plot in Mathematica, I can't do everything.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="solar sails"></category><category term="Nic shout outs"></category><category term="scott bakula"></category></entry><entry><title>Solar Sails I</title><link href="http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/solar-sails-i.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-05-16T23:29:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Corky</name></author><id>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2010-05-16:posts/solar-sails-i.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_C9Ll986gI/AAAAAAAAACY/eTykcbU6PTE/s1600/solarsail.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 200px; height: 186px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_C9Ll986gI/AAAAAAAAACY/eTykcbU6PTE/s200/solarsail.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5472081554123319810" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;Solar sails are in the news again, and this time not just for &lt;a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/06/22/tech/main703405.shtml"&gt;blowing up&lt;/a&gt;.  The Japanese space agency is &lt;a href="http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/japan-venus-double-mission-100516.html"&gt;launching&lt;/a&gt; what they hope to be the first successful solar sail tomorrow.  In honor of that, we will be discussing the physics of solar sails.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;First of all, what the heck are solar sails?  Solar sails are a means of propulsion based on the simple observation that "Hey, sails work on boats.  Therefore, they should work on interplanetary spacecraft (in space)."  Boat sails work when air molecules hit into the sail and bounce back.  By conservation of momentum, this gives the boat sail an itty bitty boost in momentum.  Summing over the large number of air molecules moving as wind, the boat gets pushed along in the water.  A similar process works with solar sails, but instead of air molecules doing the hitting, it's photons. Since each photon of a given wavelength has some momentum, by reflecting that photon the solar sail can gain a tiny bit of momentum.  Summing over the large number of photons coming from the sun over a long time frame we can get a considerable boost.  So let's see how good solar sails are. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;First we need to find the net force on our sail.  We will certainly have to deal with gravitational forces (which will slow us down) :&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ F_{g} = \frac{-GM_{\odot}m}{r^2} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;where big M is the mass of the sun and little m is the mass of the sail.  Now we need to find the radiation force on the sail.  Since force is just rate of change of momentum, we can find the change of momentum of one photon per unit time, then find how many photons are hitting our sail.  So for one elastic collision of a photon with the sail, the change in momentum will be&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \Delta p = 2 \frac{h\nu}{c} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;and by conservation of momentum, this will also be the momentum gained by the sail.  Now we want to find the number of photons incident on a given area in a given time.  This will just be the energy flux output by the sun ( energy/ m^2 s ) divided by the energy per photon.  In other words:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ f_n = \frac{L_{\odot}}{4\pi r^2}\frac{1}{h\nu} .$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So now we can get a force by&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \text{Force} = \left(\frac{\Delta p}{\text{1 photon}} \right) \times \left(\frac{\text{number of photons}}{area \times time}\right) \times \left( Area\right) $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;which is just &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ F_{rad} = 2 \frac{h\nu}{c} \times \frac{L_\odot}{4\pi r^2 h\nu} \times \pi R^2 = \frac{L_{\odot} R^2}{2cr^2} .$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So combining the radiation force with the gravitation force, we have a net force on the sail of&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ F = \left(  \frac{L_{\odot} R^2}{2c} - GM_{\odot}m \right) \frac{1}{r^2} .$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This can then be integrated over r to find an effective potential, giving:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ U = \left( \frac{L_{\odot} R^2}{2c} - GM_{\odot}m\right)\frac{1}{r} .$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For simplicity, let's just write that &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \alpha = \frac{L_{\odot} R^2}{2c} - GM_{\odot}m $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;so&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ U = \frac{\alpha}{r} .$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now we can start saying some things about this sail.  The most straightforward quantity to find would be the maximum velocity.  By conservation of energy (and starting from some r_0 at rest), we have that&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ v_f = \left[\frac{2\alpha}{m} \left(\frac{1}{r_0} - \frac{1}{r_f} \right) \right]^{1/2} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So as r_f goes to very large values, the subtracted piece gets smaller and smaller.  In the limit that r_f goes to infinity we have that&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ v_{max} = \left(\frac{2\alpha}{mr_0}\right)^{1/2} .$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Plugging back in our long term for alpha and plugging in some numbers we get:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ v_{max} = 42,000 m/s \left( \frac{1.5 \times 10^{-4}}{\sigma} - 1\right)^{1/2} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;where sigma is just the surface mass density [g/cm^2] of the sail.  Below is a plot of maximum velocity ( m/s)  plotted against surface mass density (g/cm^2).  For a sigma of 10^-4 g/cm^2, we get a max velocity of about 30,000 m/s.  Not bad.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_CjbwxG-JI/AAAAAAAAAB4/PS7tTqbmLUE/s1600/maxvel.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_CjbwxG-JI/AAAAAAAAAB4/PS7tTqbmLUE/s400/maxvel.png" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5472053244597827730" style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 202px; " /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;From this graph we see that there must be some maximum surface density, above which we don't get any (forward) motion at all.  This makes sense since we want our radiation forces (which scale with area) to overcome our gravitational forces (which scale with mass).  And below this maximal surface density we see a power law behavior.  Cool.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We can also find the distance traveled as a function of time.  Taking the final velocity equation above and writing v as dr/dt, we see that &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \frac{dr}{dt} = \left[ \frac{2\alpha}{m} \left( \frac{1}{r_0} - \frac{1}{r_f} \right)\right]^{1/2} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Rearranging and integrating, we can get time (in years) as a function of distance r (in AU):&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ t = \frac{0.11 \left(\sqrt{(-1+r) r}+\text{Log}\left[1+\sqrt{\frac{-1+r}{r}}\right]+\frac{\text{Log}[r]}{2}\right)}{\sqrt{-1+\frac{1.5 \times 10^{-4}}{\sigma}}}$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; A plot of t vs. r is shown below for typical solar system distances and a sigma of 10^-4 g/cm^2.  We assume that we are launching from earth (1 AU).  Since Pluto is at a distance of about 40 AU, we see that our sail could get there in less than 7 years.  For comparison, the &lt;a href="http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/"&gt;New Horizons&lt;/a&gt; probe will use conventional propulsion to get to Pluto in 9.5 years (and it is the fastest spacecraft ever made). &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_Ck6enlpVI/AAAAAAAAACI/_gjIHLCm_G8/s1600/ssplutolong.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_Ck6enlpVI/AAAAAAAAACI/_gjIHLCm_G8/s400/ssplutolong.png" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5472054871813629266" style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 218px; " /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;Zooming in to our starting point around 1 AU, we see that there is a period of acceleration and then the maximum velocity is reached after a few months.  Just eyeballing it, it looks like it takes at least a month to reach appreciable speed.  That it takes so long is a result of the very small forces involved due to radiation pressure.  But even a small acceleration amounts to a considerable speed if applied for long enough!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_CopsUAIrI/AAAAAAAAACQ/_-IqCnf8xs8/s1600/sscloseup.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_CopsUAIrI/AAAAAAAAACQ/_-IqCnf8xs8/s400/sscloseup.png" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5472058981478310578" style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 221px; " /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left; "&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;Now Pluto is fine I guess (it's the second largest dwarf-planet!), but how about some interstellar flight?  Well, the nearest star is Proxima Centauri which is about a parsec away.  A parsec is 3*10^16 m, or about 200,000 AU.  From, the plot below (or plugging in to the equation above), we see that such a trip would take of order 10,000 years.  That's a long time, but its not too shabby considering this craft uses no fuel of its own.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="color:#0000EE;"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="color:#000000;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="color:#0000EE;"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="color:#000000;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: none; "&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_Cgqa_fqDI/AAAAAAAAABw/xxgjj5VEZww/s1600/ssTOTHESTARS.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S_Cgqa_fqDI/AAAAAAAAABw/xxgjj5VEZww/s400/ssTOTHESTARS.png" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5472050197915740210" style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 219px; " /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;So solar sails can do some fairly impressive things simply by harnessing the free energy of the sun.  Though this only provides a very small acceleration, it can be taken over a long enough time to be useful.  However, since the radiation pressure of the sun falls off as 1/r^2, we start to observe diminishing returns and the sail reaches a max velocity.  But overall the numbers seem fairly impressive.  All that remains now is whether they are feasible to construct.  Right now my only data point for feasibility was that it was in &lt;a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/starship/solarsailer/"&gt;Star Wars&lt;/a&gt;, but as I recall that was a &lt;i&gt;long&lt;/i&gt; time ago.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Geonosian solar sailer"></category><category term="solar sails"></category><category term="scott bakula"></category></entry><entry><title>End of the Earth Physics III- Asteroids!</title><link href="http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/end-of-the-earth-physics-iii-asteroids-.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-04-22T18:45:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Corky</name></author><id>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2010-04-22:posts/end-of-the-earth-physics-iii-asteroids-.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S9EZLq8fRRI/AAAAAAAAAAc/pg5n-zg70QE/s1600/armageddon.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 157px; height: 200px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/S9EZLq8fRRI/AAAAAAAAAAc/pg5n-zg70QE/s200/armageddon.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5463175511274374418" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;No day of earth destroying celebration would be complete without that apocalyptic all-time favorite: the asteroid.  And to be fair, it deserves to be the favorite.  Of all the doomsday predictions out there (nuclear holocaust for the cynics, death by snoo-snoo for the optimists) it is the only one that is just about certain to occur at some point in the geological near future. On top of that, it's one that we could potentially avoid with enough time and some &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_deflection_strategies"&gt;neat ideas&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;div&gt;
Let's model an asteroid impact on the earth.  We will assume an asteroid starting from rest at infinity and falling to the surface of the earth due to earth's gravity only. Now obviously these assumptions are not exactly correct.  We can imagine our asteroid not starting from rest or feeling some force due to the sun.  Each of these would certainly change our answer, but should still be within an order of magnitude of our result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By conservation of energy, we have that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \text{KE}_{i} + \text{PE}_{i} = \text{KE}_{f} + \text{PE}_{f} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plugging in the formulas for kinetic and potential energy, we have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \frac{1}{2}m{v_i}^{2}  + \frac{-GM_{\oplus}m_a}{{r_{i}}}  = \text{KE}_f + \frac{-GM_{\oplus}m_a}{{r_{f}}}$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, plugging in our initial conditions of starting at rest at infinity and rearranging, we have that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \text{KE}_f = \frac{GM_{\oplus}m_a}{{R_{\oplus}}} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming that all of this kinetic energy is deposited into the earth as heat, we have that our total energy added to the earth is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \text{E} = \frac{GM_{\oplus}m_a}{{R_{\oplus}}} = \frac{(7 \times 10^{-11} J m kg^{-2})(6 \times 10^{24} kg)}{6 \times 10^{6} m}m_a \approx (10^{8} J)(\frac{m_a}{1kg})  $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's consider an asteroid made out of iron.  Iron is about 10 times denser that water so it has a density of 10^4 kg/m^3. If our asteroid is a sphere, we can find its radius given&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ m_a = \frac{4}{3} \pi {R_a}^{3} \rho $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plugging this into our energy equation gives energy as a function of asteroid radius:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \text{E} \approx (4 \times 10^{8} J) \times ( \frac{R_a}{1m} )^{3} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have the energy released during an asteroid impact in terms of either the size or the mass.  So let's do some destruction. We have heard in the last decade or so that even relatively small changes in average global temperatures can result in catastrophe. So let's see how big of an asteroid we would need to deposit enough energy to raise global temperatures by 1 degree (NOTE: this is very much a toy model.  For a more realistic and sadistically addicting model, check out &lt;a href="http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/impacteffects/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; site).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, let's pretend increasing global temperatures is the same as increasing ocean temperatures.  Since water has a much much higher specific heat than air, this seems like a reasonable assumption. Plus, we have already made this calculation before.  In the first End of the Earth post a bit ago, we found that the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of the world's oceans by 100 degrees is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ E_{\text{100}} \approx 10^{26} J $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the scaling is linear, we can see that the energy to heat up the oceans by 1 degree is just one hundredth of this value, or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ E_{\text{heat}} \approx 10^{24} J $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how big of an asteroid is this?  Using our equation from before, setting E = Eheat, we have that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ R_a = \frac{E_\text{heat}}{4 \times 10^{8} J m^{-1}} = (\frac{10^{24}}{4 \times 10^8})^{1/3}m = (2.5)^{1/3} \times{10^5}m \approx 100 km $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For comparison, the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs was thought to be about 30 km or so.  This is a big rock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FUN FACT FINALE: We all know that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs.  But what would happen if instead of an asteroid, we dropped a dinosaur from infinity?  According to wikipedia, a brontosaurus was about 30 tons which is about 30,000 kg. Using the equation for energy as a function of mass derived earlier, we have that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$\text{E} = (10^{8} J)(\frac{m_a}{1kg}) = 3 \times 10^{12} J \approx 1 \text{kiloton} \text{TNT} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For comparison, the Hiroshima bomb was about 15 kilotons.  So to reproduce the Hiroshima energy yield we need about 15 brotosauruses falling from infinity.&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="bruce willis"></category><category term="dinosaur"></category><category term="scott bakula"></category><category term="asteroid"></category></entry><entry><title>The End of Earth Physics I</title><link href="http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/the-end-of-earth-physics-i.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-04-17T16:25:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Corky</name></author><id>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2010-04-17:posts/the-end-of-earth-physics-i.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was reading the Wikipedia page for the Hitchhiker's Guide books the other day and found that it started as a series of radio shows called "The Ends of Earth."  At the end of each episode, the Earth would be destroyed.  Since I feel like this is the best way to end any TV show/movie/book/news broadcast/Mayan calendar, I will shamelessly steal the idea.  &lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Since this is the first End of the Earth post, we will start small and just consider the boiling off of all the world's oceans.  To be precise, we will consider how much energy it would take to turn all the world's water at 0 degrees Celsius to water vapor at 100 degrees Celsius.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;First we need to estimate the mass of all the water on earth.  I will make the assumptions that all water is fresh water and that the oceans account for all water on earth.  These are obviously not exactly true, but will give the proper order of magnitude.  The volume of a spherical shell is given by&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \text{V} =  4 \pi R^{2} \Delta R $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Taking the radius of the earth to be 6000 km, the ocean depth to be 1 km, and the fraction of earth covered by water to be 7/10 , we see that&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ V_\text{water} =  4 \pi  {R_{\text{earth}}^{2} \times \text{height} \times \text{fraction}$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ V_\text{water} =  4 \pi  (6 \times 10^{6} \text{m})^{2} \times 10^{3} \text{m} \times (\frac{7}{10})  = 3 \times 10^{17} \text{m}^{3}$$&lt;/mathjax&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now we have the volume of the ocean.  Now, since &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \text{Density} =  \frac{Mass}{Volume}$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;we can calculate the mass of the oceans using the density of water to be 1000 kg / m^3.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \text{Mass} =  (\rho_\text{water})(V_\text{water}) = (1000 \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{m}^{3}})(3 \times 10^{17} \text{m}^{3}) = 3 \times 10^{20} \text{kg}$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;FUN FACT: The mass of all the water on earth is about 2% the mass of that celestial punching bag known as Pluto.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Alright, now that we have the mass of the earth, we can start calculating how much energy it would take to heat it up and boil it away.  The amount of heat Q required to raise the temperature of a given material is &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ Q_\text{heat} = \text{mc}\Delta\text{T} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;where m is the mass of the thing we are heating, c is the specific heat ( the amount of energy required to heat our material up 1 degree Celcius) and delta T is our change in temperature.  This equation only holds when there are no phase transitions, so we can use it to calculate how much energy is needed to heat up the oceans from 0 degrees to 100 degrees:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ Q_\text{heat} = (3 \times 10^{20} \text{kg}) \times (4000 \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg C}}) \times (100 \text{deg C}) = 10^{26} \text{J} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;where we have used the fact that the specific heat of water is about 4000 J/kg deg C.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So now we know how much energy it takes to bring water to its boiling point, but this is not the same as boiling it off.  To find that, we need to calculate how much energy we have to add to liquid water at a constant 100 degrees to turn it into water vapor.  This is given by&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ Q_{\text{boil}} = \text{mL} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;where m is the mass again and L is the "latent heat of vaporization."  It tells us how much energy we need to add to turn a kilogram of liquid water at 100 degrees to a kilogram of water vapor at 100 degrees.  For water, L is about 2*10^6 J/kg, so&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ Q_{\text{boil}} = ( 3 \times 10^{20} \text{kg} ) \times (2 \times 10^{6} \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg}}) = 6 \times 10^{26} \text{J} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Comparing this to the energy calculated before, we see that amount of energy needed to vaporize water at 100 degrees is about six times larger than the amount of energy needed to heat up the water by  100 degrees!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now we can calculate the total amount of energy to boil way the oceans:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ Q_{\text{total}} = Q_{\text{heat}} + Q_{\text{boil}} = 7 \times 10^{26} \text{J} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So how much energy is that really?  Well the total power of the sun is &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ L_{\text{sun}} = 4 \times 10^{26} \frac{\text{J}}{\text{s}} $$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thus, it would take the entire energy output of the sun for about 2 seconds to boil away all the earth's oceans.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now thats a lot of energy.  To put this into the conventional unit of destruction, this is equivalent to 10^11 Megatons of TNT.  Typical hydrogen bombs are 10 Megatons.   So if you want to boil away the oceans with H-bombs, you'd need about ten billion hydrogen bombs.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Luckily,  short of constructing a reflecting Dyson sphere with a hole that directs all the sun's radiation at the earth, these energies are unobtainable.  So don't panic.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="scott bakula"></category><category term="end of the earth"></category></entry><entry><title>On the Nature of Many Penny Systems</title><link href="http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/on-the-nature-of-many-penny-systems.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-04-11T01:08:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Corky</name></author><id>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2010-04-11:posts/on-the-nature-of-many-penny-systems.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The other day I was on my way through ye olde internets to the Quantum Leap episode index at Wikipedia, but stumbled over a quote by Feynman by accident:&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"   style="  color: rgb(69, 69, 69); line-height: 19px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px; font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:17px;"&gt;"There are 10^11 stars in the galaxy. That used to be a huge number. But it's only a hundred billion. It's less than the national deficit! We used to call them astronomical numbers. Now we should call them economical numbers"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"    style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:180%;color:#454545;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style=" line-height: 19px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;font-size:17px;"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So this got me thinking.  What if we decided to pay the national debt...in pennies?  Seems fair enough, we don't really want to pay it and when you don't want to pay something but you have to you pay it in pennies.  Hooray!
&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Last I heard this figure was somewhere around &lt;mathjax&gt;$10,000,000,000,000 (ten trillion), that is:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$ \text{Debt} = 10^{13} \text{dollars} = 10^{15} \text{pennies}        $&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Given that a penny is about 1.5 mm thick, how far does stacking them end to end take us?  Well:&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$ \text{Length} = (10^{15} \text{pennies}) \times ( 0.15 \text{cm}) = 1.5 \times 10^{14} \text{cm} $&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;As a bit of comparison, the mean distance from the earth to the sun is &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$ \text{a} = 1.5 \times 10^{13} \text{cm,} $&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$ &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;so our penny stack goes out to 10 AU, which just barely passes by Saturn.  Impressive!&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Fine, so we've got all our pennies out now and we want to fit them in a more economical fashion, taking advantage of all three of our dimensions.  How big is the warehouse needed to hold all these shiny Lincolns?&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Well, we know (or can guess) that one penny weighs about a gram (technically 2.5 g).  So if we were to know the density of a penny, we would be good to go.  A good guess at density for any metal is around 10 g /cm^3 , and this is true for zinc ( FUN FACT: Pennies were almost entirely made of copper up until 1982, when they switched to 97.5% zinc, 2.5% copper).  So,&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$ \text{Mass} = (10^{15} \text{pennies}) \times ( 1 \frac{ \text{g}}{\text{penny}})= 10^{15} \text{g} $&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$ \text{Volume} =  \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{density}} = \frac{10^{15}\text{g}}{10 \frac{\text{g}}{\text{cm}^{3}}} = 10^{14} \text{cm}^{3}= 0.1 \text{km}}^{3} $&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;That's a warehouse 1 km wide, 1km long, and a 100 m high.  Pretty big.  So our next logical progression would be to ask: what are its gravitational properties?  To do this let's stack our pennies in a sphere.  In that case we have&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$ \text{Volume} =  \frac{4 \pi}{3} \text{R}^{3} $&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$ &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;so&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$ \text{R} = (\frac{3}{4 \pi} \text{Volume})^{1/3} = (\frac{3}{4 \pi} 10^{14} \text{cm}^{3})^{1/3} \approx 3 \times 10^4 \text{cm}=0.3 \text{km.} $&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$ &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;To find the gravitational binding energy of a sphere of uniform density we use&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$ \text{Binding Energy} =  \frac{3}{5} \frac{\text{G}\text{M}^{2}}{R}\text{.} $&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;So &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$ \text{Binding Energy} =  \frac{3}{5} \frac{ (7 \times 10^{-8} \frac{cm^3}{gs^2})(10^{15} \text{g})^{2}}{3 \times 10^{4} \text{cm}} \approx 10^{18} \text{ergs} = 10^{11} \text{Joules.}   $&lt;/mathjax&gt;$&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Noting that the useful measure of destruction, the kiloton of TNT, is about 10^12 J, we see that the binding energy of our spherical mass of pennies is about 100 tons of TNT.  So what does this mean to us practically?  Well, the binding energy of an object essentially tells us how much energy we need to put in to completely break up the body.  So to fully disperse our pennies off to our lendors, we need about 100 tons of TNT worth of energy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;An alternative financial fermi problem that might be interesting is how many trees would it take to make the money to equal the national debt or GDP?  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

For posterity, completeness and another superfluous Scott Bakula reference I present the following.  It is an expression, through the majesty of song (rap), of our love for all things quantum and undead ( or perhaps a superposition of dead/ not dead states...? ).&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We all know that the great physicist Paul Dirac, was not a vampire.  What this rap presupposes is... maybe he was?  If so, he would almost certainly be named Diracula.  He would be especially good at physics.  But he would especially be totally rad at rapping.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
