&lt;p&gt;Have you ever sat on a beach and wondered how many grains of sand there were?  I have, but I may be a special case.  Today we&amp;#8217;re going to take that a step further, and figure out how many grains of sand there are on the entire earth.  (Caveat: I&amp;#8217;m only going to consider sand above the water level, since I don&amp;#8217;t have any idea what the composition of the ocean floor&amp;nbsp;is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I&amp;#8217;m going to start by figuring out how much beach there is in the world.  If you look at a map of the world, there are four main coasts that run, essentially, a half circumference of the world.  We&amp;#8217;ll say the total length of coast the world has is roughly two circumferences.  As an order of magnitude, I would say that the average beach width is 100 m, and the average depth is 10 m.  This gives a total beach volume&amp;nbsp;of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ (100 m)(10 m)(4 \pi (6500 km) )= 82 km^3$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s not a whole lot of volume.  Let&amp;#8217;s think about deserts.  The Sahara desert is by far the largest sandy desert in the world.  Just as a guess, we&amp;#8217;ll assume that the rest of the sandy deserts amount to 20% (arbitrary number picked staring at a map) as much area as the Sahara.  According to wikipedia the area of the Sahara is 9.4 million km^2.  We&amp;#8217;ll take, to an order of magnitude, that the sand is 100 m deep.  10 m seems to little, and 1 km too much.  That amounts to ~1 million km^3 of&amp;nbsp;sand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re going to assume that a grain of sand is about 1 mm in radius  The volume occupied by a grain of sand is then 1 mm^3.  Putting that together with our previous number for the occupied volume&amp;nbsp;gives&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;$$ \frac{1\cdot 10^6 km^3}{1 mm^3}=\frac{1 \cdot 10^{15}}{1\cdot 10^{-9}}=1\cdot 10^{24}$$&lt;/mathjax&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s a lot of grains of&amp;nbsp;sand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addendum:
Carl Sagan is quoted as saying
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 20px;"&gt;&amp;#8220;The total number of stars in the Universe is larger than all the grains of sand on all the beaches of the planet Earth&amp;#8221;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;If we just use our beach volume, that gives a total number of grains of sand as ~1*10^20, which is large, but not as large as what we found above.  Is that less than the number of stars in in the universe?  Well, that&amp;#8217;s a question for another day (or google), but the answer is, to our best estimate/count,&amp;nbsp;yes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jesse</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2011 11:33:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:thephysicsvirtuosi.com,2011-07-18:posts/grains-of-sand.html</guid><category>sand</category><category>order of magnitude</category><category>carl sagan</category></item></channel></rss>
