  Rhubarb pie (Source: Wikipedia)</p>
<hr>
<p>Some people know a <em>suspiciously</em> large number of the digits of pi.
Perhaps you have met one of these people. They can typically be found
hiding behind bushes and under the counters at pastry shops, just...
<em>waiting</em>. At the slightest hint of a mention of pi, they will jump out
and start reciting the digits like there's a prize at the end. After
rattling off numbers for a few minutes they abruptly come to an end,
grin like an idiot, and walk away. It is an unpleasant encounter. The
sheer uselessness of this kind of thing has always bothered me, so I'd
like to set a preliminary upper bound on the number of digits of pi that
could ever possibly potentially kind of be useful (maybe). For those
following along at home, now would be a good time to put on your
numerology hats. Alright, so I hear this thing pi is fairly useful when
dealing with circles. Let's say we want to make a really big circle and
have its diameter only deviate by a very small amount from the correct
value. To do this successfully, we will have to know pi fairly well.
Let's take this to extremes now. Suppose I want to put a circle around
the <em>entire visible universe</em> such that the uncertainty in the diameter
is the size of a <em>single proton</em>. What would be the fractional
uncertainty in the circumference in this case? If we know pi exactly,
then we have that $$\delta C = \frac{\partial C}{\partial d} \delta
d = \pi \delta d = C \frac{\delta d}{d}, $$ where d is the diameter
and C is the circumference. In other words, the fractional uncertainty
in the circumference is just $$\frac{\delta C}{C} = \frac{\delta
d}{d}. $$ Using a femtometer for the size of a proton and 90 billion
light years for the size of the Universe <a href="posts/old/a-very-small-slice-of-pi/#note">[1]</a>, we get
$$\frac{\delta C}{C} = \frac{\delta d}{d} =
\frac{10^{-15}\mbox{m}}{(90\times10^9)(3\times10^7\mbox{s})(3\times10^8\mbox{m
s}^{-1})} \sim\frac{10^{-15}}{10^{27}}\sim10^{-42}.$$ Alright, so
how well do we need to know pi to get a similar fractional uncertainty?
Well, we have that $$\frac{\delta \pi}{\pi} = \frac{\delta C}{C} =
10^{-42}, $$ so we can afford an uncertainty in pi of $$ \delta \pi =
\pi \times 10^{-42}$$ and thus we'll need to know pi to about 42
digits. How's that for an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Answer_to_the_Ultimate_Question_of_Life.2C_the_Universe.2C_and_Everything_.2842.29">answer</a>?
So if we have a giant circle the size of the <em>entire visible universe</em>,
we can find its diameter to within the size of a <em>single proton</em> using
pi to 42 digits. Therefore, I adopt this as the maximal number of digits
that could ever prove useful in a physical sense (albeit under a
somewhat bizzarre set of circumstances). If reciting hundreds of digits
is what makes you happy, go for it. But 42 digits is more than enough pi
for me.</p>
<p>[1] "But I thought the Universe was only 13.7 billion years! What voodoo
is this!?" Yeah, I know. See

<p>Recently, I've been concerned with the fact that I don't know many large
primes. Why? I don't know. This has led to a search for easy to remember
prime numbers. I've found a few goods ones, namely</p>
<ul>
<li>867-5309 - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/867-5309/Jenny">Jenny's
    number</a>
</li>
<li>the digit 1 - 1031 times, in the style of the picture to above, and
    the largest known <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repunit_prime#Repunit_primes">repunit
    prime</a>
</li>
<li>1987 (my birth year), 2011 (last year), 1999 (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_(song)">the party
    year</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>But then I remembered that I already know 50 digits of pi, memorized one
boring day in grade school, so this got me wondering whether there were
any primes among the digits of pi</p>
<p>Lo an behold, I wrote a <a href="https://gist.github.com/2033970">little
script</a>, and found a few:</p>
<p>Found one, with 1 digits, is: 3 Found one, with 2 digits, is: 31 Found
one, with 6 digits, is: 314159 Found a rounded one with 12 digits, is:
314159265359 Found one, with 38 digits, is:
31415926535897932384626433832795028841</p>
<p>I think it's usual for most science geeks to know pi to at least
3.14159, if you're one of those people, now you know a 6 digit prime!
for free!</p>

<hr>
<p>Today was a sunny exception to the grey overcast rule of weather in
Ithaca. I <em>should</em> be overjoyed by this anomaly, spending the day
outside flying a kite or playing frisbee with a border collie in a
bandanna. Unfortunately, today was also the beginning of Daylight
Savings Time (DST) - my least favorite day of the year. For my
colleagues unfamiliar with this temporal travesty (I'm looking at you
Arizona), let me briefly explain DST. Once a year, the time lords steal
a single hour from us and place it in an escrow account for future
disbursement, presumably in some elaborate scheme to gain the favor of
hat-throwing farmer-clock hybrids (see image left). The details are a
bit murky, but the net result is that today I had one less hour to do my
very favorite thing in the whole wide world - sleep. It also means that
I have to set my watch, so I figured I'd check in and see how well my
<a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2012/02/time-keeps-on-slippin.html">previous
model</a>
for time-loss in my watch has held up. About a month ago, I looked at
how my watch slowly deviated from the <a href="http://nist.time.gov/timezone.cgi?Eastern/d/-5/java">official
time</a> (the original
post can be found
<a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2012/02/time-keeps-on-slippin.html">here</a>
and a helpful clarification by Tom can be found
<a href="http://blogs.scienceforums.net/swansont/archives/11014">here</a>). Based
on a little over 50 days worth of data, I found that my watch lost about
0.35 seconds per day against the official time. About 50 days have
passed since my last measurement and today when I set the watch, so I
thought it would be interesting to see how well my model fit the new
data. The old data are presented in Figure 1 in blue, the old best fit
line is in red, and the new data point (taken this morning) is in green.
As always, click through the plot for a larger version.</p>

  Figure 1</p>
<hr>
<p>The new data point appears to be in fair agreement with the old best-fit
model, but it's a little hard to see here. Zooming in a bit, though, we
see that the model lies outside the error bar of the new data point.</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1euutOYSIrs/T1125Hi_XNI/AAAAAAAAAVY/tnWZ6N3mJJs/s1600/dst_update_short.png"><img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1euutOYSIrs/T1125Hi_XNI/AAAAAAAAAVY/tnWZ6N3mJJs/s400/dst_update_short.png"></a>
  Figure 2</p>
<hr>
<p>So is this a big deal? Not really. But if it will help you sleep at
night, we can redo the fitting with the new data point included to see
how much things change. The the plots with the updated model to include
all data points are provided below with the old data in blue and the new
point in green.</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oIeLFmzJgKI/T115TGf3laI/AAAAAAAAAVg/RHPJuP9UrKk/s1600/dst_newfit_long.png"><img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oIeLFmzJgKI/T115TGf3laI/AAAAAAAAAVg/RHPJuP9UrKk/s400/dst_newfit_long.png"></a>
  Figure 3</p>
<hr>
<p>The new model looks a whole lot like the old one, except the best fit
line now appears to go through the new data point. Zooming in a little,
we see that it does indeed fall within the error bars of our new point.</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EUf50O2-jjQ/T11514CpS_I/AAAAAAAAAVo/Ryt2v1LOeVk/s1600/dst_newfit_short.png"><img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EUf50O2-jjQ/T11514CpS_I/AAAAAAAAAVo/Ryt2v1LOeVk/s400/dst_newfit_short.png"></a>
  Figure 4</p>
<hr>
<p>Alright, so the new model fits with our new point, but how much did the
model have to change? Well, the fit to just the old data gave an offset
of 0.36 seconds and a loss rate of 0.35 seconds per day. The new model
has an offset of 0.40 seconds and a loss rate of 0.348 seconds per day.
Overall, not a significant change.
It looks as though I may continue to not worry about the accuracy of my
watch. I have set it to match the official time and have no intention of
fiddling with it until I have to set it again at the end of Daylight
Savings Time - my favorite day of the year.</p>

    <p>Dearest readers,
This is my first post on The Virtuosi, so I thought I’d take a moment to
introduce myself. I’m a first year physics graduate student at Cornell,
recently joined after 2 years working as an engineer first at a private
firm and then at a national lab. I myself have had lots of fun following
the exploits of my estimable colleagues here on The Virtuosi, and I
thought I could bring a new angle to the content here. I would like to
use this space to discuss how science interacts with everyday life in a
cultural sense. How does science appear in popular culture? How do
political or social issues relate back to science? Those sorts of
questions. (I understand that there are plenty of other resources
elsewhere that offer far more intelligent insight into these matters
than I can, but in the very least this will give people a chance point
them out to me as they yell at me in the forum below.)
Enough intro, here begins my very first blog post:
Being interested in how science is communicated to the public, I am an
avid reader of popular science. While academic types sometimes dismiss
this kind of writing as shallow or otherwise uninteresting, I think
science writers perform a very important function serving as a way to
convey information about conceptually challenging topics to a general
audience. At their best, I find that these books serve as examples for
how I can communicate my own ideas better, and in addition challenge my
understanding of how science relates back to society in general.
This being said, I cannot recommend Charles Seife’s <em>Proofiness</em> enough.
The basic premise of this book is to explore the way that good
mathematics is hijacked, twisted, or ignored in everyday life, and the
ugly consequences of the tendency to misunderstand numbers and
measurements.
Seife gives a number of fascinating examples of the ways in which
numbers and math connect to American democracy. American government
functions through representation, and so the
“<a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html">enumeration</a>”
of citizens and their opinions through the Census and elections is an
essential part of the democratic process. This “enumeration” is a
counting measurement, subject to errors like any other. And yet, the
laws that govern how Censuses and elections are run ignore this fact.
Seife’s discussion of elections (and in particular <em>Bush v. Gore</em>) is
fascinating, but I won’t spoil that here. Here’s my take on the
discussion of the Census that appears in <em>Proofiness</em>:
Consider a (vague) physics experiment. I want to know how many particles
are inside a box. To figure this out, I have a detector that goes
<em>ping</em> every time a particle passes through it. I set up my detector
inside the box and count the number of times that it goes <em>ping</em> in a
certain amount of time. I can then use that count to guess at the number
of particles that I have in my box. My measurement will let me estimate
N to within some margin of error. This process is perhaps unnecessary if
I have only five particles in my box (in which case, I might just open
the box and count what I see inside), but if I have 300 million
particles in my box, it would be totally impractical for me to reach
into the box 300 million times and count each one individually.
We can consider the Census to be just like this physics experiment. I
have N inhabitants (particles) living in my country (box), and I can use
my detector (census replies) to count a certain number of people. In
principle, using well-understood statistical techniques of regression
and error analysis, I can estimate to within a very good margin of error
how many people live in each region of the country. Instead, what the
Census requires is that we reach inside the box (send representatives to
every household that doesn’t reply by mail) and count every single
person. The whole process ignores the fact that even if we send a
representative to every single household there will still be some margin
of error in our counting measurements. No such measurement can be made
without errors.
The consequences of ignoring these errors, says Seife, can be that we
waste money in attempting the impossible and trying to count everybody.
From a civic-minded perspective, this attitude towards the perfection of
the Census can backfire. For example, if undercounting occurs (i.e.,
certain households do not respond for some reason), the Census has no
mechanism for correcting that miscount. Counter-intuitively, the Census
laws actually prohibit the use of any statistical techniques to correct
miscounting. The result is that those slow to respond are ignored and
not taken into account when allotting seats in the legislature to
represent them.
<em>Proofiness</em> is a fascinating book and a fun read, and I recommend you
all look it up. In addition, it serves as an excellent example of
science writing that helped me to rethink how scientific ideas relate to
everyday life. I hope to invite consideration of these topics here and
in future posts. If you want to know more about the inspiration for this

  This is picture of a watch. (Source: Wikipedia)</p>
<hr>
<p>A couple of months ago, the Virtuosi Action Team (VAT) assembled for
lunch and the discussion quickly and unexpectedly turned to watches. As
Nic and Alemi argued over the finer parts of fancy-dancy watch
ownership, I looked down at my watch: the lowly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_F91W">Casio
F-91W</a>. Though it certainly
isn't fancy, it is inexpensive, durable, and could potentially win me an
all-expense paid trip to the
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/25/guantanamo-files-casio-wristwatch-alqaida">Caribbean</a>.
But how <em>good</em> of a watch is it? To find out, I decided to time it
against the official U.S. time for a couple of months. Incidentally,
about half-way in I found out that Chad over at <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/principles/">Uncertain
Principles</a> had done essentially
the same thing
<a href="http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2011/05/the_testing_of_time_measuring.php">already</a>.
No matter, science is still fun even if you aren't the first person to
do it. So here's my "new-to-me" analysis. Alright, so how do we go about
quantifying how "good" a watch is? Well, there seem to be two main
things we can test. The first of these is accuracy. That is, how close
does this watch come to the <em>actual</em> time (according to some time
system)? If the official time is 3:00 pm and my watch claims it is 5:00
am, then it is not very accurate. The second measure of "good-ness" is
precision or, in watch parlance, stability. This is essentially a
measure of the consistency of the watch. If I have a watch that is
consistently off by 5 minutes from the official time, then it is not
accurate but it is still stable. In essence, a very consistent watch
would be just as good as an accurate one, because we can always just
subtract off the known offset. To test any of the above measures of how
"good" my cheap watch is, we will need to know the actual time. We will
adopt the official U.S. time as provided on the <a href="http://nist.time.gov/timezone.cgi?Eastern/d/-5/java">NIST
website</a>. This time
is determined and maintained by a collection of really impressive atomic
clocks. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST-F1">One of these</a> is in
Colorado and the other is secretly guarded by an ever-vigilant Time Lord
(see Figure 1).</p>

<hr>
<p>At 9:00:00 am EST on November 30th, I synchronized my watch with the
time displayed on the NIST website. For the next 54 days, I kept track
of the difference between my watch an the NIST time. On the 55th day, I
forgot to check the time and the experiment promptly ended. The results
are plotted below in Figure 2 (and, as with all plots, click through for
a larger version).</p>

  Figure 2: Best-fit to time difference</p>
<hr>
<p>As you can see from Figure 2, the amount of time the watch lost over the
timing period appears to be fairly linear. There does appear to be a
jagged-ness to the data, though. This is mainly caused by the fact that
both the watch and the NIST website only report times to the nearest
second. As a result, the finest time resolution I was willing to report
was about half a second. Adopting an uncertainty of half a second, I did
a least-squares fit of a straight line to the data and found that the
watch loses about 0.35 seconds per day. As far as accuracy goes, that's
not bad! No matter what, I'll have to set my watch at least twice a year
to appease the Daylight Savings Gods. The longest stretch between
resetting is about 8 months. If I synchronize my watch with the NIST
time to "spring forward" in March, it will only lose about $$ t_{loss}
= 8\~\mbox{months} \times 30\frac{\mbox{days}}{\mbox{month}}
\times 0.35 \frac{\mbox{sec}}{\mbox{day}} = 84\~\mbox{sec} $$
before I have to re-synchronize to "fall back" in November. Assuming the
loss rate is constant, I'll never be more than about a minute and a half
off the "actual" time. That's good enough for me. Furthermore, if the
watch is <em>consistently</em> losing 0.35 seconds per day and I know how long
ago I last synchronized, I can always correct for the offset. In this
case, I can always know the official time to within a second (assuming I
can add). But <em>is</em> the watch consistent? That's a good question. The
simplest means of finding the stability of the watch would be to look at
the timing residuals between the data and the model. That is, we will
consider how "off" each point is from our constant rate-loss model. A
plot of the results is shown below in Figure 3.</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-13ULtvOlXuU/TzCpp6LGvfI/AAAAAAAAATM/8rybD1lxZOo/s1600/residuals.png"><img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-13ULtvOlXuU/TzCpp6LGvfI/AAAAAAAAATM/8rybD1lxZOo/s400/residuals.png"></a>
  Figure 3: Timing residuals</p>
<hr>
<p>From Figure 3, we see that the data fit the model pretty well. There's a
little bit of a wiggle going on there and we see some strong short-term
correlations (the latter is an artifact of the fact that I could only
get times to the nearest second). To get some sense of the timing
stability from the residuals, we can calculate the standard deviation,
which will give us a figure for how "off" the data typically are from
the model. The standard deviation of the residuals is $$ \sigma_{res}
= 0.19\~\mbox{sec}. $$ A good guess at the fractional stability of the
watch would then just be the standard deviation divided by the sampling
interval, $$ \frac{\sigma_{res}}{T} = 0.19\~\mbox{sec} \times
\frac{1}{1\~\mbox{day}} \times
\frac{1\~\mbox{day}}{24\times3600\~\mbox{sec}} \approx
2\times10^{-6}.$$ In words, this means that each "tick" of the watch
is consistent with the average "tick" value to about 2 parts in a
million. That's nice...but isn't there something <em>fancier</em> we could be
doing? Well, I have been wanting to learn about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_variance">Allan
variance</a> for some time
now, so let's try that. The Allan variance (refs: <a href="http://www.ino.it/~azavatta/References/Allan.pdf">original
paper</a> and a
<a href="http://tf.boulder.nist.gov/general/pdf/118.pdf">review</a>) can be used to
find the fractional frequency stability of an oscillator over a wide
range of time scales. Roughly speaking, the Allan variance tells us how
averaging our residuals over different chunks of time affects the
stability of our data. The square root of the Allan variance,
essentially the "Allan standard deviation," is plotted against various
averaging times for our data below in Figure 4.</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_zhCroHDoNE/TzC7XYkDZ1I/AAAAAAAAATU/mCaspxYhlxA/s1600/allan_variance.png"><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_zhCroHDoNE/TzC7XYkDZ1I/AAAAAAAAATU/mCaspxYhlxA/s400/allan_variance.png"></a>
  Figure 4: Allan variance of our residuals</p>
<hr>
<p>From Figure 4, we see that as we increase the averaging time from one
day to ten days, the Allan deviation decreases. That is, the averaging
reduces the amount of variation in the frequency of the data, making it
more stable. However, at around 10 days of averaging time it seems as
though we hit a floor in how low we can go. Since the error bars get
really big here, this may not be a real effect. If it is real, though,
this would be indicative of some low-frequency noise in our oscillator.
For those who prefer colors, this would be
"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colors_of_noise">red</a>" noise. Since the
Allan deviation gives the fractional frequency stability of the
oscillator, we have that $$\sigma_A = \frac{\delta f}{f} =
\frac{\delta(1/t)}{1/t} = \frac{\delta t}{t}. $$ Looking at the
plot, we see that with an averaging time of one day, the fractional time
stability of the watch is $$\frac{\delta t}{t} \approx
2\times10^{-6}, $$ which corresponds nicely to our previously
calculated value. If we average over chunks that are ten days long
instead, we get a fractional stability of $$\frac{\delta t}{t}
\approx 10^{-7}, $$ which would correspond to a deviation from our
model of about 0.008 seconds. Not bad. The initial question that started
this whole ordeal was "How good is my watch?" and I think we can safely
answer that with "as good as I'll ever need it to be." Hooray for cheap
and effective electronics!</p>

  The 1833 Leonids (Source: Wikipedia)</p>
<hr>
<p>Word on the street is there's a meteor shower set for late Tuesday
night, peaking at 2 am EST on January 4th <a href="posts/old/the-stars-fell-on-abe-and-frederick/#footnote-1">[1]</a><a href="posts/old/the-stars-fell-on-abe-and-frederick/"></a>. The
meteors in question are the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrantids">Quadrantids</a>, which often go
unnoticed for two good reasons. Reason the first: apparently
<a href="posts/old/the-stars-fell-on-abe-and-frederick/#footnote-2">[2]</a><a href="posts/old/the-stars-fell-on-abe-and-frederick/"></a>, they are usually pretty awful. Unlike the "good"
meteor showers, the Quadrantids are bright and pretty for only a few
hours (instead of a few days). This means that a lot of the time, we
just miss them. Reason the second: they have a lame name
<a href="posts/old/the-stars-fell-on-abe-and-frederick/#footnote-3">[3]</a><a href="posts/old/the-stars-fell-on-abe-and-frederick/"></a>. But this year, they should be pretty good if the
weather is right. Now, there's lots of neat physics to talk about with
meteors, but that's not why I bring it up. This has all just been flimsy
pretext so I could share a historical anecdote about a meteor shower.
Trickery, indeed. Those who feel cheated are free to leave now with
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apu_585SW18">heads held high</a>. Those
still around (Hi, Mom!) will hear about the night in 1833 when the stars
fell on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ibV3tCDvd8">Alabama</a> (and the
rest of the country, too). The
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonids">Leonids</a> typically put on a
pretty good show, but their showing in 1833 was so dramatic that the
term "meteor shower" was coined to describe what was happening. The 1833
Leonids were truly one for the ages and made such an impression that
people were often able to remember when events happened by their
relation to the night when "the stars fell." It was in this use as a
"calendar anchor" that I first heard of this particular meteor shower.
While home for the holiday I was reading <em>Life and Times of Frederick
Douglass</em>, one of the later autobiographies written by the former slave
and noted abolitionist. Recounting when he was moved from Baltimore to a
plantation on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, Douglass writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I went to St. Michaels to live in March, 1833. I know the year,
because it was the one succeeding the first cholera in Baltimore, and
was also the year of that strange phenomenon when the heavens seemed
about to part with their starry train. I witnessed this gorgeous
spectacle, and was awe-struck. The air seemed filled with bright
descending messengers from the sky. It was about daybreak when I saw
this sublime scene. I was not without the suggestion, at the moment,
that it might be the harbinger of the coming of the Son of Man; and in
my then state of mind I was prepared to hail Him as my friend and
deliverer. I had read that the "stars shall fall from heaven," and
they were now falling. I was suffering very much in my mind. It did
seem that every time the young tendrils of my affection became
attached they were rudely broken by some unnatural outside power; and
I was looking away to heaven for the rest denied me on earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Douglass wrote these words almost 50 years after the fact and it is
evident that the meteor shower clearly had an effect on him. By this
time (at age 15), Douglass had already made up his mind to escape from
slavery. Three years later, he made a failed attempt. Two years after
that, in 1838, Frederick Douglass escaped to the North and became an
influential abolitionist. After reading the above passage from Douglass,
I wondered who else may have seen the 1833 Leonids. After a bit of
research, I found a paper by <a href="http://ecommons.txstate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&amp;context=physfacp&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fsa%3Dt%26rct%3Dj%26q%3Dolson%2Blincoln%2Bleonids%26source%3Dweb%26cd%3D1%26ved%3D0CB4QFjAA%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fecommons.txstate.edu%252Fcgi%252Fviewcontent.cgi%253Farticle%253D1004%2526context%253Dphysfacp%26ei%3DaogCT_2TB4rv0gGZ_5HoBw%26usg%3DAFQjCNE8HE4-k_Zcl2PzK2shdtMCi6ZyEQ#search=%22olson%20lincoln%20leonids%22">Olson &amp; Jasinski
(1999)</a>
which provides an excerpt from Walt Whitman recounting a story told by
Abraham Lincoln. Whitman writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the gloomiest period of the war, he [Lincoln] had a call from a
large delegation of bank presidents. In the talk after business was
settled, one of the big Dons asked Mr. Lincoln if his conﬁdence in the
permanency of the Union was not beginning to be shaken — whereupon the
homely President told a little story. “When I was a young man in
Illinois,” said he, “I boarded for a time with a Deacon of the
Presbyterian church. One night I was roused from my sleep by a rap at
the door, &amp; I heard the Deacon’s voice exclaiming ‘Arise, Abraham, the
day of judgment has come!’ I sprang from my bed &amp; rushed to the
window, and saw the stars falling in great showers! But looking back
of them in the heavens I saw all the grand old constellations with
which I was so well acquainted, ﬁxed and true in their places.
Gentlemen, the world did not come to an end then, nor will the Union
now."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Abraham Lincoln witnessed the 1833 meteor shower and was still telling
stories about it 30 years later.</p>
<p>So what's the point of this whole story? Is there any significance to
the fact that the man who escaped slavery to tell the world of its evils
and "The Great Emancipator" both saw the same meteor shower? Probably
not. Tons of people saw it.</p>
<p>Regardless, it is interesting to think about. Though these men would
cross paths several times over the next 30 years, the earliest memory
they shared was of a night in 1833, when a 15 year old slave in Maryland
and a 24 year old boarder in Illinois watched the stars fall from the
sky.</p>

<p>[3] Like other meteor showers, the Quadrantids take their name from the
constellation from which the meteors seem to emerge. In this case,

  Buzz Aldrin's bootprint (source: Wikipedia)</p>
<hr>
<p>A couple of months ago, I stumbled across a bunch of
<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/revisited/index.html">pictures</a>
of Apollo landing sites taken by one of the cameras onboard the Lunar
Reconnaissance Orbiter. The images have a resolution high enough that
you can resolve features on the surface down to about a meter. Looking
at the Apollo 17 <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/584392main_M168000580LR_ap17_area.jpg">landing
site</a>,
you can see the trails of both astronauts and a moon buggy. It's pretty
cool. It also got me thinking about how long the landing sites would be
preserved. More specifically, I want to know how long Buzz Aldrin's
right bootprint (shown, incidentally, to the left) will last on the
Moon. Since the Moon has no atmosphere, the wind and rain that would
weather away a similar bootprint here on Earth are not present and it
seems as though the print would last a really long time. But how long?
Let's try to quantify it <a href="posts/old/how-long-will-a-bootprint-last-on-the-moon-/#footnote-yariv">[1]</a><a href="posts/old/how-long-will-a-bootprint-last-on-the-moon-/"></a>. Pick Your Poison
Before we get going, we need to figure out what physical process would
be most important in erasing a bootprint from the Moon. Although the
Moon lacks the conventional "weathering" we experience on Earth (due to
wind, rain, etc), it does experience something called "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_weathering">space
weathering</a>." Space
weathering is the changing of the lunar surface due to cosmic rays,
micrometeorite collisions, regular meteorite collisions, and the solar
wind <a href="posts/old/how-long-will-a-bootprint-last-on-the-moon-/#footnote-wind">[2]</a><a href="posts/old/how-long-will-a-bootprint-last-on-the-moon-/"></a>. Of these phenomena, the most apparent
and well-studied would be the meteorites which have covered the Moon in
craters. We adopt the meteorite impact as our primary means of wiping
out a bootprint and restate our question as follows: "How long would it
take for a meteorite to hit the Moon such that the resulting crater
wipes out Aldrin's right bootprint?" Background As it is currently
stated, we can answer our question if we knew the rate of formation and
size distribution of the craters on the Moon. We could count up all the
craters on the Moon (or a particular region of interest) and tabulate
their sizes. This would give us the size distribution. It would also
give us a headache and potentially drive us to lunacy
<a href="posts/old/how-long-will-a-bootprint-last-on-the-moon-/#footnote-forced">[3]</a><a href="posts/old/how-long-will-a-bootprint-last-on-the-moon-/"></a>. Luckily, someone has beat us to it. <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1966MNRAS.134..245C">Cross
(1966)</a> used images
from the Ranger 7 and 8 missions to count craters and determine the size
distribution of craters in three regions of the Moon. The data for the
crater distribution in the Sea of Tranquility (where Apollo 11 landed)
are given in the figure below. Cross found that in the Sea of
Tranquility, the number of craters with diameters greater than X meters
(per million square kilometers) is given by: $$ N(d&gt;X) =
10^{10}\left(\frac{X}{1\~\mbox{m}}\right)^{-2}, $$ which holds for
craters with diameters between 1 meter and 10 kilometers (see figure
below).</p>

  Figure 2 from Cross (1966)</p>
<hr>
<p>We can also estimate the rate at which craters are formed from this
data. If we assume that the craters formed at a constant rate over the
age of the Moon (about 4 billion years), then we get about 2.5 craters
with diameters above 1 meter formed in a million square kilometer area
every year. This is a "crater flux" for the Moon. Written another way,
the crater flux in the Sea of Tranquility is $$F \approx
1\~{\mbox{km}}^{-2} \frac{1}{4\times10^5\~\mbox{yr}}, $$ so we get
that roughly one crater with diameter greater than 1 meter is formed on
a square kilometer of the Moon once every 400,000 years or so. We now
have enough information to do some simulations. Simulation I wrote up a
code that simulates craters being formed on a 1 square kilometer patch
of the Moon. A crater is randomly placed in the 1 square kilometer
region with a diameter pulled from the above distribution. The bootprint
is placed at the center of the grid and craters are formed until we get
a "hit." At that point, the time is recorded and the run stops. As a
sanity check, I thought it would be fun to just let the simulation run
without caring if the boot was hit or not. By simulating the craters in
this way for 4 billion years, I should get something that looks like the
Moon at the present day. Here's a 200 m square from my simulation:

<p>Just eyeballing it, things look pretty good. Now it's time for the
actual simulation. I ran the simulation 10,000 times and tabulated the
amount of time needed before the bootprint was hit. The figure below
gives the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function">CDF</a> for
the hit times in the simulation. That is, for each time T, we find the
fraction of simulations in which the bootprint got hit in a time less
than or equal to T. The dashed lines in the plot indicate the amount of
time needed to pass for half of the simulations to have recorded a hit.
This time turns out to be about 24 billion years.</p>

<p>Conclusions and Caveats Based on the simulations, the bootprint on the
Moon would have about even odds of lasting at least 20 billion years
<em>if</em> the primary means of destruction is through the formation of a
crater from a meteorite. However, there are a few caveats that should be
addressed. These deal with either the details of the simulation or the
assumptions we have made. In the simulation, we just took at 1 km square
patch of the moon and scaled back the "crater flux" accordingly.
However, this does not fully account for all possible craters that can
form. For example, our simulation would miss an event that hit 50 km
away from the target, but had a diameter of 100 km. Obviously this would
hit the target, but we are only seeding craters in the 1 square km
region. This would mean that the actual lifetime of the bootprint would
be less than our 24 billion year figure. Re-running with a 10km by 10km
square region, we find a lifetime of 18 billion years. Thus, an increase
in area by a factor of 100 only reduces the age by 25%. Considering
areas much larger than this makes the simulation prohibitively slow, but
the order unity effect does not seem too significant. Additionally, we
have made a number of assumptions. The big one is that we have assumed
that the craters currently seen on the Moon were formed uniformly in
time. In fact, a large fraction of the craters may have been formed when
the Moon was still very young (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Heavy_Bombardment">Late Heavy
Bombardment</a>). If
this were the case, we would have greatly overestimated the rate of
crater formation and thus underestimated the time needed to hit the
bootprint. In spite of these caveats, let's take our value of 20 billion
years to be accurate. What else can we say? Well, if we are right then
we are wrong because the Moon may not last that long (and it's hard to
have bootprints on the Moon without a Moon). Current
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun#Life_cycle">estimates</a> have that the
Sun will expand into a red giant and (potentially) destroy the Earth
(and the Moon) in about 5 billion years. So a record of the Apollo
astronauts' boot sizes could potentially last as long as the Moon

Hi folks. It's been an embarrassingly long time since I last posted, but
today's news on the Higgs boson has brought me out of hiding. I want to
share my thoughts on today's announcement from the CMS and ATLAS
collaborations on their searches for the Higgs boson. I'm a member of
the CMS collaboration, but these are my views and don't represent those
of the collaboration. The upshot is that ATLAS sees a 2.3 sigma signal
for a Higgs boson at 126 GeV. CMS sees a 1.9 sigma excess around 124
GeV. CERN is being wishy-washy about whether or not this is actually a
discovery. After all the media hype leading up to the announcement, this
is somewhat disappointing, but maybe not too surprising. First of all,
what does a 2 sigma signal mean? The significance corresponds to the
probability of seeing a signal as large or larger than the observed one
given only background events. That is, what's the chance of seeing what
we saw if there is no Higgs boson? You can think of the significance in
terms of a Normal distribution. The probability of the observation
corresponds to the integral of the tails of the Normal distribution from
the significance to infinity. For those of you in the know, this is just
1 minus the CDF evaluated at the significance. For a 2 sigma
observation, this corresponds to about 5%. For both experiments, there
was a 5% chance of observing the signal they observed or bigger if the
Higgs boson doesn't exist. In medicine, this would be considered an
unqualified success. So why is CERN being so cagey? In particle physics
we require at least 3 sigma before we even consider something
interesting, and 5 sigma to consider it an unambiguous discovery. The
reasons why the burden of proof is so much higher in particle physics
than in other fields aren't entirely clear to me. I suspect is has to do
with the relative ease of running the collider a little longer compared
to recruiting more human test subjects, to use medicine as an example.
Given what I've just told you that we need a 3 sigma significance in
particle physics, why is everyone so excited about a couple of 2 sigma
results? Well, the first reason is that both results show bumps at
approximately the same Higgs mass. Although it's not rigorous, you can
get a rough idea of what the significance of the combined results are by
adding the significances in quadrature. This gives us about 2.8 sigma.
Higher, but still not up to the magic number of 3. The explanation for
the excitement that is most compelling brings us to Bayesian statistics.
The paradigm of Bayesian statistics says that our belief in something
given new information is the product of our prior beliefs and a term
which updates them based on the new information. Physicists have long
expected to find a Higgs boson with a mass around 120 GeV. So our prior
degree of belief is pretty high. Thus, it doesn't take as much to
convince us (or me anyway) that we have observed the Higgs boson. In
contrast, consider the OPERA collaboration's measurement of neutrinos
going faster than the speed of light. This claims to be a 6 sigma
result, but no one expected to find superluminal neutrinos, so our (or
at least my) prior for this is much lower. (Aside: If the OPERA result
is wrong, it is likely due to a systematic effect rather than a
statistical one. Nevertheless, I stand by my point.) The final thing
that excites me about this observation is that what we've seen is
completely consistent with what we would expect to see from the Standard
Model. Forgetting about significances for the moment, when the CMS
experiment fits for the Higgs boson mass, they find a cross section that
agrees very well with that predicted by the Standard Model. In the plot
below, you're interested in the masses where the black line is near 1.
The ATLAS experiment actually sees more signal than one would expect.
This is likely just a statistical fluctuation, and explains why the
ATLAS result has a higher significance. <img alt="GUIDO HIGGS CERN SEMINAR pdf

In conclusion, while CERN is being non-committal, in my opinion, we have
seen the first hints of the Higgs boson. This is mostly due to my high
personal prior that there the Higgs boson exists around the observed
mass. Unfortunately, Bayesian priors are for the most part a qualitative
thing. Thus, ATLAS and CMS are sticking to the hard numbers, which say
that what we have looks promising, but is not yet anything to get
excited about. I'll close by reminding you all to take this all with a
grain of salt. There is every possibility that this is just a
fluctuation. I'll remind you that at the end of last summer, CMS and
ATLAS both showed a <a href="http://resonaances.blogspot.com/2011/07/higgs-wont-come-out-of-closet.html">3 sigma
excess</a>
around 140 GeV, which went away just a month later at the next
conference. So let's cross our fingers that next year's data will give
us a definitive answer on this question. By the way, if anyone wants to
know more, fire away in the comments. I'll do my best.</p>

  Not a DeLorean. You're doing it wrong.</p>
<hr>
<p>[<em>Update: Prize Update / Added link to full solutions</em>] Welcome to the
second Physics Challenge Award show!
[APPLAUSE]
Our judges have deliberated for several units of time and I now have in
my hands the envelope holding our list of winners. I could easily just
tell you who won right now and save everyone some time, but award shows
need some suspense to work effectively, so let's first give some tedious
background information!
[APPLAUSE]
You may recall that the winner of the first <a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2011/03/physics-challenge-award-show.html">Physics
Challenge</a>
contest won a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRC_Handbook_of_Chemistry_and_Physics">CRC
Handbook</a>.
We will not be giving out CRCs this time around. We felt that such a
prize was far too <del>expensive</del> impersonal, so we have opted this year
for something <del>much cheaper</del> from the heart. The following prizes will
be awarded to our top three solutions:
<strong>First Prize:</strong> Our first prize winner will receive an actual
back-of-an-envelope used in one of our posts (gasp!) signed by all the
of the members of the Virtuosi that I can find at colloquium tomorrow.
But that's not all! Alemi will also salute in your general direction.
<strong>Second Prize:</strong> For our second prize winner, we appear to have run out
of envelopes... but Alemi will still salute in your general direction.
You will not see him do this, but you will feel a major disturbance in
the Awesome Force (mediated, of course, through the midi-chlorian
boson).
<strong>Third Prize:</strong> You will receive no material prize, but on your
deathbed you will receive <em>total consciousness</em>. So you've got that
going for you, which is nice.
Let's first remind everyone what the Challenge problem was. The full
text of the problem can be found
<a href="http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~aalemi/challenge/timemachine.php">here</a>,
but the gist is basically this: You've created a time machine and you're
biggest fear is that you'll be stuck back in the past without any way to
communicate to the future that your design worked and you deserve all
kinds of Nobel prizes. The solution should be able to last long periods
of time (who knows how far back in time you'll go?), should maximize the
chances of modern people finding it, and be able to convince people that
you have in fact gone back in time.
Alright, let's get to some solutions already!
<strong>First Place:</strong> The first place solution comes from Christian, who uses
some biological wrangling to solve the time traveller conundrum. With
some information from the
<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/craig_venter_unveils_synthetic_life.html">announcement</a>
of "synthetic life" and some bio how-to from an entity known only as
"steve," Christian plans to implant a message into the DNA of bacteria.
The message will contain his name, identifying information, and the url
of a website which will (presumably) contain a video of him with one
hand outstretched saying "Nobel prize please."
Let's see how this solution satisfies our criteria for a successful
solution. <em>Does it work for an arbitrary amount of time?</em> It appears to,
so long as the bacteria manage to survive and the message doesn't become
too garbled over time (perhaps some error-correction might be useful).
Additionally, if one is worried about introducing non-native bacteria to
the wild you could bring back a bunch of bacteria that were known to
exist over wide periods of time and just release those alive at the
time. <em>Will modern humans find it?</em> It seems that geneticists are
decoding just about any genome they can get their hands on, so this is a
strong possibility. <em>Would it convince people that someone travelled in
time?</em> If the bacteria has dispersed enough, shows enough variation over
geographic regions, and contains specific identifying information about
a missing person who has allegedly created a time machine, I think
that's pretty strong evidence. Neato, gang!
<strong>Second Place:</strong> The second place solution comes from Kyle, who offers
a space-based answer. Kyle suggests etching detailed plans of the time
travel mechanism (flux capacitor) onto a durable metal and putting that
bad boy into space. He suggests that anyone capable of building a fully
functional time machine should have no problem launching a small
satellite. Fair enough. Additionally, the satellite would use some kind
of solar power or the like to produce a low-power radio signal. In fact,
this signal would only need to spit something out once every year or ten
years or something. Since radio communication precedes space
exploration, the detection of an artificial satellite sending a message
would attract a fair deal of attention. The plans and successful
reproduction of the time machine would then seal the deal.
Does this solution satisfy the necessary conditions? I think so.
Assuming all goes according to plan, this would easily be detected by
modern people and, assuming the time machine plans are accurate, would
provide indisputable proof. My main concern would be that the satellite
could be launched and survive to the present. Modern satellites need
constant boosts to stay in orbit, without which they fall back onto
Earth and burn up. One potential solution would be to put it on the
Moon. This is technically much more difficult, but hey, you just created
a time machine! Also, putting it on the moon then allows for a totally
rad recreation of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolith_(Space_Odyssey)">Monolith</a> scene
in <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>.
<strong>Third Place:</strong> The third place solution comes from Yariv. Though Yariv
did not submit a solution through the proper channels (he follows no
one's rules, not even his own), he was overheard to give a solution.
While the Physics Challenge planning committee was discussing the
problem over lunch, Yariv flippantly dismissed the entire premise as
"trivial" and suggested a two-word solution: "radioactive paint."
Personally, I like the idea of bewildered archaeologists finding a cave
painting of Yariv riding a dinosaur done using a variety of radioactive
paints which all date back 200 million years. For this amusement, I
award Yariv the third place prize for this contest. As a member of the
Virtuosi, however, Yariv is ineligible to receive a prize and instead
receives 5 demerits on his record for his willful disregard of our
institution's rules and excessive flippancy. One more slip-up and you'll
lose your badge!

  A very cold person points out Betelgeuse</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Betelgeuse is a massive star at the very end of its life and could
explode any second now!</em> Every time I hear that I get really <em>really</em>
excited. Like a kid in a candy store that's about to see a star blow up
like nobody's business. This giddiness will last for a solid minute
before I realize that "any second now" is taken on astronomical
timescales and roughly translates to "sometime in the next million years
maybe possibly." Then I feel sad. But you know what always cheers me up?
Calculating things! Hooray! So let's take a look at the ways Betelgeuse
could end its life (even if it's not going to happen tomorrow) and how
these would affect Earth. First, a little background. Betelgeuse is the
bright orangey-red star that sits at the head/armpit of Orion. It is one
of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_brightest_stars">brightest</a>
stars in the night sky. Its distance has been measured by the
<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipparcos">Hipparcos</a></em>satellite to be
about 200 parsecs [1] from Earth (about 600 light years). Betelgeuse is
at least 10 times as massive as our Sun and has a diameter that would
easily accomodate the orbit of Mars. In fact, the star is big enough and
close enough that it can actually be spatially resolved by the Hubble
Space Telescope! Being so big and bright, Betelgeuse is destined to die
young, going out with a bang as a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova#Core_collapse">core-collapse</a>
supernova. This massive explosion ejects a good deal of "star stuff"
into interstellar space [2] and leaves behind either a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star">neutron
star</a> or a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole">black
hole</a>. Alright, now that we're
all caught up, let's turn our focus on this "massive explosion" bit.
What kind of energy scale are we talking about if Betelgeuse blows up?
Well, a pretty good upper bound would be if all of the star's mass (10
solar masses worth!) were converted directly to energy, so $$ E_{max} =
mc^2 =
10M_{\odot}\times\left(\frac{2\times10^{30}\~\mbox{kg}}{1\~M_{\odot}}\right)\times
\left(3\times10^8\~\mbox{m/s}\right)^2 $$ which is about $$
E_{max} \sim 10^{48}\~\mbox{J} $$ and that's nothing to shake a
stick at. But remember, this is if the <em>entire star</em> were converted
directly to energy, and that would be hard to do. Typical fusion
efficiencies are about \~1% [3], so let's say a reasonable estimate for
the total nuclear energy available is $$ E_{nuc} \sim \eta_{f}
\times E_{max} \sim 10^{-2} \times 10^{48}\~\mbox{J} \sim
10^{46}\~\mbox{J}. $$ This is the total energy released by a typical
supernova. As it turns out though, 99% of this energy is carried away in
the form of neutrinos and only about 1% is carried away in photons.
Since we are mainly concerned with how this explosion will affect Earth,
and the neutrinos will just pass on by, we will only consider the 1% of
energy released in photons that would reasonably interact with Earth.
That gives us $$ E_{ph} \sim 0.01 \times E_{nuc} \sim
10^{44}\~\mbox{J}. $$ Neato, so that's the total amount of energy
released in a supernova in the form of photons. How much of this energy
would be deposited at the Earth if Betelgeuse exploded? Well, if the
energy is deposited isotropically (that is, the same in all directions),
then the fluence (or time integrated energy flux) is given by $$ F_{ph}
= \frac{E_{ph}}{4\pi d^2}. $$ All this is saying is that the total
energy release by the supernova spreads out uniformly over a sphere of
radius d, so the fluence will give us the amount of energy deposited in
each square meter of that sphere (the units of fluence here are J/m^2).
The total energy deposited on Earth is then $$ E_{\oplus} = F_{ph}
\times \pi R^2_{\oplus}. $$ Hot dog! Let's plug in some numbers,
already. The total energy deposited on the Earth by a symmetrically
exploding Betelgeuse at a distance of d = 200 pc (where 1 pc = 3 <em>
10^16 m) is $$E_{\oplus}=\frac{E_{ph}}{4\pi d^2}\times\pi
R^2_{\oplus}\sim
10^{19}\~\mbox{J}\left(\frac{E_{ph}}{10^{44}\~\mbox{J}}\right)\left(\frac{d}{200\~\mbox{pc}}\right)^{-2}.$$
Well, 10^19 J certainly </em>seems* like a lot of energy. In fact, it is
roughly the amount of energy contained in the entire nuclear arsenal of
the United States [4]. But it is spread over the entire atmosphere. Is
there a way to gauge how this would affect life on Earth? We could see
how much it would heat up the atmosphere using specific heats: $$ E =
m_{atm}c_{air}\Delta T $$ where c is the specific heat of air
(\~10^3 J per kg per K). Oops, looks like we need to know the mass of
the atmosphere. But we can figure this out, the answer is pushing right
down on our heads! We know the pressure at the surface of the Earth (1
atm = 101 kPa) and that pressure is just the result of the weight of the
atmosphere pushing down on us. Since pressure is just force / area, we
have $$ P = F/A = m_{atm}g / A_{\oplus} $$ So $$ m_{atm} =
\frac{P\times4\pi
R^2_{\oplus}}{g}=\frac{10^5\~\mbox{Pa}\times4\pi
(6\times10^6\~\mbox{m})^2}{9.8\~\mbox{m/s}^2}\approx4\times10^{18}\~\mbox{kg}.$$
Neato, gang. So we could see a temperature rise of about $$ \Delta T =
\frac{E_{ph}}{m_{atm}c_{air}}=\frac{10^{19}\~\mbox{J}}{4\times10^{18}\~\mbox{kg}\times10^3\~\mbox{J/
kg K}}\approx0.003\~\mbox{K}, $$ or three one-thousandths of a degree.
Remember, too, that this will be an upper bound since we are assuming
that all this energy is deposited into the atmosphere before it has a
chance to cool. In fact, if the energy is deposited over the course of
hours or days, this value will be much less. So it looks like we've
wrapped this thing up: Betelgeuse exploding will most certainly not put
the Earth in any danger. Or did we? We have considered the case of a
symmetric supernova, but there's more than one way to blow up a star.
Massive stars can also end their lives in a fantastic explosion called a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-ray_burst">gamma-ray burst</a> (GRBs to
the hep cats that study them, some fun facts relegated to [5]). GRBs are
still an intense area of current study, but the current picture (for one
type of GRB, at least) is that they are the result of a star blowing up
with the energy of the explosion focussed into two narrow beams (see
picture below). Since the flux isn't distributed over the whole sphere,
GRBs can be seen at much greater distances than a typical supernova.</p>

  Example of a gamma-ray burst, with the explosion in two beams.</p>
<hr>
<p>So how will this change our answer? Well, it's going to change the
fluence we calculated above. Instead of spreading the energy out over
the whole sphere, it's only going to go to some fraction of the 4pi
steradians. So we get $$ F_{ph} = \frac{E_{ph}}{4\pi f_{\Omega}
d^2}, $$ where f_{omega} is called the "beaming fraction" and tells us
what fraction of the sphere the energy goes through. Typical GRB beams
range from 1 to 10 degrees in radius. Converting this to radians, we can
find the beaming fraction as $$ f_{\Omega} = \frac{2 \times \pi
\theta^2}{4\pi} \approx
10^{-4}\left(\frac{\theta}{1^\circ}\right)^2,$$ so the beaming
fraction is 10^-4 and 10^-2 for a beam angle of 1 degree and 10
degrees, respectively. Alright, so now we can redo the calculations we
did for the supernova case, but keeping this beaming fraction around.
The total amount of energy that would hit Earth is then about
$$E_{\oplus}=\frac{E_{ph}}{4\pi f_{\Omega} d^2}\times\pi
R^2_{\oplus}\sim
10^{23}\~\mbox{J}\left(\frac{E_{ph}}{10^{44}\~\mbox{J}}\right)\left(\frac{d}{200\~\mbox{pc}}\right)^{-2}\left(\frac{\theta}{1^\circ}\right)^{-2}.$$
Holy sixth-of-a-moley! Continuing as we did above, we find that this
could potentially heat up the atmosphere by $$ \Delta T =
\frac{E_{ph}}{m_{atm}c_{air}}=\frac{10^{23}\~\mbox{J}}{4\times10^{18}\~\mbox{kg}\times10^3\~\mbox{J/
kg
K}}\approx3\~\mbox{K}\left(\frac{\theta}{1^\circ}\right)^{-2},
$$ which is certainly non-negligible. Now, this won't destroy the planet
[6], but it could make things really uncomfortable. This will be
especially true when you realize that a fair amount of the energy
carried away from a gamma-ray burst is in the form of (wait for it...)
gamma-rays, which will wreck havoc on your DNA. Remember, though, that
this is an absolute worst-case scenario since we have assumed the
smallest beaming angle. But this may still make us a little nervous, so
is there anyway to figure out if Betelgeuse could, in fact, beam a
gamma-ray burst towards Earth? Yes, yes there is. Jets and beams like
those in GRBs typically point along the rotation axis of the star [7].
If we could determine the rotational axis of Betelgeuse, then we could
say whether or not there's a chance it's pointed towards us. It just so
happens that Betelgeuse is the only star (aside from our Sun) that is
spatially resolved. If you could measure spectra along the star, you
could look for Doppler shifting of absorption lines and say something
about the velocity at the surface of the star. Luckily, this has already
been done for us (see, for example <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998AJ....116.2501U">Uitenbroek et al.
1998</a>). These
measurements are hard to do since the star is only a few pixels wide,
but it appears as though the rotation axis is inclined to the
line-of-sight by about 20 degrees (see figure below). That means this
would require a beam with at least a 20 degree radius to hit the Earth.
This appears to be outside the typical ranges observed. So even if
Betelgeuse were to explode in a gamma-ray burst, the beam would miss
Earth and hit some dumb other planet nobody cares about.</p>

<p>Alright, so the moral of the story is that Betelgeuse is completely
harmless to people on Earth. When it does explode, it will be a
brilliant supernova that would likely be visible at least a little bit
during the day. It will be the coolest thing that anyone alive (if there
are people...) will ever see. Sadly, this explosion could take place at
just about any time during the next million years. Assuming a uniform
distribution over this time period and a human lifetime of order 100
years, there is something like a 1 in 10,000 chance you'll see this in
your life. Feel free to hope for a spectacular astronomical sight, but
don't lose sleep worrying about being hurt by Betelgeuse!

Run. For a description of the actual distance unit see

how anything heavier than helium gets distributed throughout the
universe. The hydrogen and helium formed after the Big Bang gets fused
into heavier elements in stars and then dispersed out through
supernovae. In fact, most things heavier than Iron actually <em>require</em>
supernovae to even exist. If you have any gold on you right now (I'm
looking at you Mr. T), that only exists <em>because a star exploded!</em> [3]
Let's consider the case of turning 4 protons into a Helium nucleus.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium-4">Helium-4</a> has a binding energy
of about 28 MeV, which means that the total energy of a bound He-4
nucleus is 28 MeV less than its free protons and neutrons (in other
words, we need to put in 28 MeV to break it up). So the process of
turning 4 protons into a Helium nucleus gives off 28 MeV worth of
energy. But we had a total of 4 times 1000 MeV worth of matter we could
have turned into energy. Thus, the process was 28 MeV/4000 MeV \~ 0.7%
efficient at turning matter into energy. [4] Sometime last year, the
United States
<a href="http://www.defense.gov/npr/docs/10-05-03_Fact_Sheet_US_Nuclear_Transparency__FINAL_w_Date.pdf">disclosed</a>
that its nuclear arsenal as of Sept 2009 was something like 5000
warheads. Assume these to be Megaton warheads. A Megaton is about 4 <em>
10^15 J, so the total energy in the US arsenal is about 5000 * 4 </em>
10^15 J = 2 * 10^19 J. [5] A fun fact about GRBs: They were
discovered by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vela_(satellite)">military
satellite</a> looking for
illegal nuclear tests, which would emit some gamma-rays. Instead of
seeing a signal on Earth, they saw bursts coming from space. I really
really hope that someone's first thought was that the Russians were
testing nukes on the Moon or something. <em>We must not allow a moon-nuke
gap!</em> [6] We here at the Virtuosi are contractually obligated to only
destroy the Earth in our posts on Earth day. I apologize for any
inconvenience this may cause. [7] I am not exactly sure why this is the
case. It is certainly observed to be the case and I thought there was a
straightforward explanation for why this was the case, but I don't
really have a good explanation. Although, maybe there just <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_jet">isn't a good
one yet.</a> [8] For comparison,
there is about a 1 in 3000

you'll be struck by lightning in your lifetime.</p>
