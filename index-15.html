<p><a href="http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/how-cold-is-the-ground-.html">Last week</a> 
(ok, it was a little more than a few days ago...) I used
dimensional analysis to figure out how the ground's temperature changes
with time. But although dimensional analysis can give us information
about the length scales in the problem, it doesn't tell us what the
solution looks like. From dimensional analysis, we don't even know what
the solution does at large times and distances. (Although we can usually
see the asymptotic behavior directly from the equation.) So let's go
ahead and solve the the heat equation exactly: </p>
<p>$$ \frac {\partial T}{\partial t} = a \frac {\partial ^2 T}{\partial x^2} \quad (1)$$ </p>
<p>Well, what type of solution do we want to this equation? We want the
temperature at the Earth's surface $x=0$ to change with the days or the
seasons. So let's start out modeling this with a sinusoidal dependence
-- we'll look for a solution of the form </p>
<p>$$ T(x,t) = A(x)e^{i wt} $$</p>
<p>for some function $A(x)$, then we can take the real part for our
solution. Plugging this into Eq. (1) gives 
$A^{\prime\prime} = i\omega/a \times A$, or </p>
<p>$$ A(x) = e^{ \pm \sqrt{w/2a } (1+i) x} $$ </p>
<p>Since we have a second-order
ordinary differential equation for $A$, we have two possible solutions,
which are like $\exp(+x)$ or $\exp(-x)$. Which one do we choose? </p>
<p><a id="note1"></a>
Well, we want the temperature very far away from the surface of the ground to be
constant, so we need the solution that decays with distance,
$A\exp(-x)$. Taking the real part of this solution, we 
find<a href="posts/old/how-cold-is-the-ground-ii/#fnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> </p>
<p>$$ T(x,t) = T_0 \cos (wt + \sqrt{w/2a}\times x ) e^{-\sqrt{w/2a}x} \quad (2) $$ </p>
<p>Well, what does this solution <em>say</em>?
As we expected from our scaling arguments last week, the distance scale
depends on the <em>square root</em> of the time scale -- if we decrease our
frequency by 4 (say, looking at changes over a season vs over a month),
the ground gets cooler only $2{\times}$ deeper. We also see that the temperature
oscillation drops off quite rapidly as we go deeper into the ground, and
that there is a "lag" the farther you go into the ground. In particular,
we see that at distances deep into the ground, the temperature drops to
its average value at the surface. You can see this all in the pretty
plot below (generated with Python):</p>
<div style="float: center;">
<figure><img src="images/how-cold-is-the-ground-ii/SingleFrequency.png" alt="GAH!" width="60%"><figcaption style="text-align=center;">
  Single frequency plot
  </figcaption></figure>
</div>

<p>Let's recap. To model the temperature of the ground, we looked for a
solution to the heat equation which had a sinusoidally oscillating
temperature at $x=0$, and decayed to 0 at large $x$. We found a solution
such a solution, and it shows that the temperature decays rapidly as we
go far into the ground. At this point, there are two questions that pop
into mind: </p>
<p>1) Is the solution that we found <em>unique</em>? Or are there other
possible solutions? </p>
<p>2) This is all well and good, but what if our days
or seasons <em>aren't perfect sines</em>? Can we find a solution that describes
this behavior? </p>
<p><a id="note2"></a>
I'll give one (1) VirtuosiPoint to the first commenter
who can prove to what extent the above solution is 
unique<a href="posts/old/how-cold-is-the-ground-ii/#fnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. But how about the second point? Can we solve this
for non-sinusoidal time variations? Well, at this point most of the
readers are rolling their eyes and shouting "Use a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series">Fourier series</a> and move on." So I
will. Briefly, it turns out that (more or less) <em>any</em> periodic function
can be written as a sum of sines &amp; cosines. So we can just add a bunch
of sines and cosines together and construct our final solution. So just
for fun, here is a plot of the temperature of the ground in Ithaca (data
from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ithaca,_New_York">Wikipedia</a>) over a
year. (I used a discrete Fourier transform to compute the coefficients.)</p>
<div style="float: center;">
<figure><img src="images/how-cold-is-the-ground-ii/IthacaTemp.png" alt="ithaca temp!" width="60%"><figcaption style="text-align=center;">
  The temperature (colorbar) is in degrees C, assuming a=0.5 mm^2/s from <a href="http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/how-cold-is-the-ground-.html">before</a>.
  </figcaption></figure>
</div>

<p>Looks pretty boring, but I swear that all the frequencies are in that
plot. It just turns out that the seasons in Ithaca are pretty
sinusoidal. So about 20 meters below Ithaca, the temperature is a pretty
constant 8 C. While I was postponing writing this, I wondered what the
temperature on Mercury's rocks would be. If we dig deep enough, can we
find an area with habitable temperatures? Some
<a href="http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2000/OlesyaNisanov.shtml">quick</a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_%28planet%29#Surface_conditions_and_.22atmosphere.22_.28exosphere.29">Googlin</a>'
shows that the daytime and nighttime temperatures on Mercury are
${\sim}550-700~{\rm K}$ and ${\sim}110~{\rm K}$ at the "equator." 
While I don't think that Mercury's temperature varies symmetrically, let's assume so for lack of
better data.<a href="posts/old/how-cold-is-the-ground-ii/#fnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Then we'd expect that deep into the
surface, the temperature would be fairly constant in time, at the
average of these two extremes. Plugging in the numbers 
(assuming $a\approx0.52~{\rm mm}^2 / s$ and using a Mercurial solar day as 176 days), we get</p>
<p>$T=94~{\rm C}$ at 2.75 meters into the surface.</p>
<p><a id="fnote1"></a>
1. <a href="posts/old/how-cold-is-the-ground-ii/#note1">^</a> More precisely, since the heat equation is linear and real, if
$T(x,t)$ is a solution to the equation, then so are $\frac{1}{2}(T+T^{<em>})$ or
$\frac{1}{2i}(T-T^{</em>})$.</p>
<p><a id="fnote2"></a>
2. <a href="posts/old/how-cold-is-the-ground-ii/#note2">^</a> Hint: It's not unique. For instance, here is another solution that
satisfies the constraints, with no internal heat sources or sinks 
(I'll call it the "freshly buried" solution):</p>

<p>It snowed in Ithaca a few weeks ago. Which sucked. But fortunately, it
had been warm for the previous few days, and the ground was still warm
so the snow melted fast. Aside from letting me enjoy the absurd
arguments against global warming that snow in April birthed, this got me
thinking: How cold is the ground throughout the year? At night vs.
during the day? And the corollary: How cold is my basement? If I dig a
deeper basement, can I save on heating and cooling? (I'm very cheap.)</p>
<p>Well, we want to know the temperature distribution $T$ of the ground as
a function of time $t$ and position $x$. So some googlin' or previous
knowledge shows that we need to solve the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation">heat equation</a>. </p>
<p>For our purposes,
we can treat the Earth as flat (I don't plan on digging a basement deep
enough to see the curvature of the Earth), so we can assume the
temperature only changes with the depth into the ground $x$: </p>
<p>$$ \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = a \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2}\qquad (1) $$ </p>
<p>where $a$ is the thermal diffusivity of the material, in
units of square meters per second. It looks like we're going to have to
solve some partial differential equations! Or will we? We can get a very
good estimate of how much the temperature changes with depth just by
dimensional analysis. </p>
<p>Let's measure our time $t$ in terms of a
characteristic time of our problem $w$ 
(it could be 1 year if we were trying to see the change in the ground's temperature from summer to winter, 
or 1 day if we were looking at the change from day to night).
Then we can write: </p>
<p>$$ \frac{\partial T }{\partial t} = \frac{1}{w} \frac {\partial T} {\partial t/w} $$ </p>
<p>plugging this in Eq. (1),
rearranging, and calling $l= \sqrt{wa}$ gives.... </p>
<p>$$ \frac{\partial T}{\partial (t/w)} = \frac{\partial ^2 T}{\partial (x/l )^2} $$ </p>
<p>Now let's say we didn't know how to or didn't want to solve
this equation. (Don't worry, we do &amp; we will). From rearranging this
equation, we see right away there is only one "length scale" in the
problem, $l$. So if we had to guess, we could guess that the ground
changes temperature a distance $l$ into the ground. A quick look at
Wikipedia for 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_diffusivity">thermal diffusivities</a> 
gives us the following table, for materials we'd find in the ground:</p>

<p>So we would expect that the temperature of the ground doesn't change
much on a daily basis a foot or so below the ground, and doesn't change
ever about 15-20 feet into the ground. Just to pat ourselves on the back
for our skills at dimensional analysis, a quick check shows that
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permafrost#Time_to_form_deep_permafrost">permafrost</a>
penetrates 14.6 feet into the ground after 1 year. So our dimensional
estimates looks pretty good! In the next few days I'll solve this
equation exactly and throw up a few pretty graphs, and maybe talk a
little about PDE's and Fourier series in the process.</p>

We also are making secret plans for our volcano lair and death ray.
However, since it is earth day, we will only share with you the plans
for the total doom of the earth, not the cybernetically enhanced guard
dogs we're building for our <a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2012/04/earth-day-2012-escape-to-moon.html">moon
base</a>.
The plan I reveal today is elegant in its simplicity. I intend to alter
the orbit of the earth enough to cause the earth to freeze, thus ending
life as we know it. According to the internet at large, the average
surface temperature of the earth is \~15 C. This average surface
temperature is directly related to the power output of the sun. More
precisely, it is directly related to the radiated power from the sun
that the earth absorbs. Assuming that the earth's temperature is not
changing (true enough for our purposes), the then power radiated by the
earth must be equal to the power absorbed from the sun. More precisely
$$ P_{rad,earth}=P_{abs,sun}$$ Now, the radiated power goes as
$$P_{rad}=\epsilon \sigma A_{earth} T^4 $$ where A_earth is the
surface area of the earth, T is the temperature of the earth, and
epsilon and sigma are constants. I'll be conservative and say that I
want to cool the temperature of the earth down to 0 C. The ratio of the
power the earth will emit is
$$\frac{P_{new}}{P_{old}}=\frac{T_{new}^4}{T_{old}^4} \approx
.81$$ Note that the temperature ratio must be done in Kelvin. The power
radiated by the sun (or any star) drops off as the inverse square of the
distance from the sun to the point of interest: $$P_{sun} \sim
\frac{1}{r^2} $$ To reduce the power the earth receives from the sun
to 81% of the current value would require
$$\frac{P_{sun,new}}{P_{sun,old}}=\frac{r_{old}^2}{r_{new}^2}=.81
$$ This tells us that the new earth-sun distance must be larger than the
old (a good sanity check). In fact, it gives $$r_{new}=1.11 r_{old} $$
So I'll need to move the earth by 11% of the current distance from the
earth to the sun. No small task! The earth is in a circular orbit (or
close enough). To change to a circular orbit of larger radius requires
two applications of thrust at opposite points in the orbit It turns out
that the required boost in speed (the ratio of the speeds just before
and after applying thrust) for the first boost of an object changing
orbits is given by
$$\frac{v_{f}}{v_{i}}=\sqrt{\frac{2R_{f}}{R_i+R_f}}=1.026$$ To
move from the transfer orbit to the final circular orbit requires
$$\frac{v_{f}}{v_{i}}=\sqrt{\frac{R_{i}+R_f}{2R_i}}=1.027$$ Note
that despite the fact that we boost the velocity at both points, the
velocity of the final orbit is less than that of the initial. Now, how
could we apply that much thrust? Well, the change in momentum for the
earth from each stage is roughly (ignoring the slight velocity increase
of the transfer orbit) $$\Delta p = .03M_E v_E $$ The mass of the
earth is \~6<em>10^24 kg, the orbital velocity is \~30 km/s, so $$\Delta
p = 5\cdot 10^{27} kg</em>m/s$$ A solid rocket booster (the booster
rocket used for shuttle launches, when those still happened) can apply
about 12 MN of force for 75 s (thank you wikipedia). That's a net
momentum change of \~900 <em>10^9 kg</em>m/s (900 billion!). So we would
only need $$\frac{2*5\cdot 10^{27}}{9\cdot 10^{11}}=12 \cdot
10^{15}$$ That's right, only 12 million billion booster rockets! With
those I can freeze the earth. I assure you that this plan is proceeding
on schedule, and will be ready shortly after we have constructed our
volcano lair.</p>

                    <p>It is now Earth Day 2012, and, according to the Mayan predictions, <a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/search/label/end%20of%20the%20earth">The
Virtuosi will destroy the
earth</a>.
In a futile attempt to fight my own mortality, I decided to send
something to the Moon. It seems, for a poor graduate student trying to
get to the Moon, the most difficult part is the Earth holding me back.
So first I'll focus on escaping the Earth's gravitational potential
well, and if that's possible, then I'll worry about more technical
problems, such as actually hitting the moon. Moreover, in honor of the
destructive spirit of The Virtuosi near Earth Day, I'll try to do this
in the most Wiley-Coyote-esque way possible. <strong>Preliminaries</strong> If we
want to get to the Moon, we need to first figure out how much energy
we'll need to escape the Earth's gravitational pull. "That's easy!" you
say. "We need to escape a gravitational well, and we know from Newton's
law that the potential from a spherical mass <em>ME</em> 's gravity for a test
mass <em>m</em> is : \begin{equation} \Phi = - \frac {G M_{E} m}{r}
\label{eqn:gravpot} \end{equation} We're currently sitting at the
radius of the Earth <em>RE</em>, so we simply need to plug this value in and
we'll find out how much energy we need." This is all well and good, but
i) I can never remember what the gravitational constant <em>G</em> is, and ii)
I have no idea what the mass of the Earth <em>ME</em> is. So let's see if we
can recast this in a form that's easier to do mental arithmetic in.
Well, we know that the force of gravity is the related to the potential
by: $$ \vec{F}(r) = - \vec{\nabla} \Phi = - \frac {d\Phi}{dr}
\hat{r} \ \vec{F} = - \frac {G m M_E } {r^2}
\label{eqn:gravforce} $$ Moreover, we all know that the force of
gravity at the Earth's surface is <em>F(r=RE)=-mg</em>. Substituting this in
gives: $$ \frac {G m M_E} {R_E^2} = m g \quad \textrm{, or} $$
\begin{equation} \frac {G m M_E}{R_E} = m g {R_E} \quad .
\label{eqn:betterDef} \end{equation} So the depth of the Earth's
potential well at the Earth's surface is <em>mgRE</em>. If we use <em>g</em> = 9.8
m/s^2 \~ 10 m/s^2 and <em>RE</em> = 6378 km \~ 6x10^6 m, then we can write
this as \begin{equation} \Delta \Phi = m g {R_E} \approx m \times
6 \times 10^7 \textrm{m}^2/\textrm{s}^2 \quad \textrm{(1)},
\end{equation} give or take. How fast do we need to go if we're going
to make it to the Moon? Well, at the minimum, we need the kinetic energy
of our object to be equal to the depth of the potential well
<a href="posts/old/earth-day-2012-escape-to-the-moon/#footnote-1">[1]</a>, or $$ \frac 1 2 m v^2 = 6 m \times 10^7
\textrm{m}^2/\textrm{s}^2 \quad \textrm{or} \ v \approx 1.1
\times 10^4 \textrm{ m/s (2)} . $$ So we need to go pretty fast --
this is about Mach 33 (33 times the speed of sound in air). At this
speed, we'd get from NYC to LA in under 7 minutes. Looks difficult, but
let's see just how difficult it is. <strong>Attempt I: Shoot to the Moon</strong>
What goes fast? Bullets go fast. Can we shoot our payload to the moon?
Let's make some quick estimates. First, can we shoot a regular bullet to
the moon? Well, we said that we need to go about Mach 33, and a fast
bullet only goes about Mach 2, so we won't even get close. Since energy
is proportional to velocity squared, we'll only have (2/33)^2 \~ 0.4 %
of the necessary kinetic energy. <a href="posts/old/earth-day-2012-escape-to-the-moon/#footnote-2">[2]</a> So let's make a
bigger bullet. How big does it need to be? Well, loosely speaking, we
have the chemical potential energy of the powder being converted into
kinetic energy of the bullet. Let's assume that the kinetic energy
transfer ratio of the powder is constant. If a bullet receives kinetic
energy <em>1/2mbvb^2</em> from a mass <em>mP</em> of powder, then for our payload to
have kinetic energy <em>1/2 M V^2</em>, we need a mass of powder <em>MP</em> such
that \begin{equation} \frac {M_P} {m_P} = \frac M {m_b} \times
\frac {V^2}{v_b^2} \end{equation} A quick reference to Wikipedia
for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.62%C3%9751mm_NATO">7.62x51mm NATO
bullet</a> shows that
\~25 grams of powder propels a \~10 gram bullet at a speed of \~Mach
2.5. We need to get our payload moving at Mach 33, so (<em>V/vb</em>)^2 \~
175. If we send a 10 kg payload to the Moon, we have <em>M/mb</em> \~ 1000. So
we'll need about 1.75 x 10^5 the amount of powder of a bullet to get us
to the Moon, or about 4400 kg, which is 4.8 tons (English) of powder.
That's a lot of gunpowder to get us to the Moon. For comparison, if we
are going to construct a tube-like "case" for our 10 kg
bullet-to-the-Moon, it will have to be about half a meter in diameter
and 17 feet tall. So I'm not going to be able to shoot anything to the
Moon anytime soon. <strong>Attempt II: Charge to the Moon</strong> OK, shooting
something to the Moon is out. Can we use an electric field to propel
something to the Moon? Well, we would need to pass a charged object
through a potential difference such that \begin{equation} q \Delta
\Phi_E = m g R_E = 6 m \times 10^7 \textrm{m}^2/\textrm{s}^2
\quad . \label{eqn:chargepot} \end{equation} After the humiliation of
the last section, let's start out small. Can we send an electron to the
Moon? We could plug numbers into this equation, but I'm too lazy to look
up all those values. Instead, we know that we need to get our electron
(rest mass 511 keV) to a speed which is (Eq. 2) $$v \approx 1.1 \times
10^4 \textrm{m/s} \approx 4 \times 10^{-5} c. $$ So an electron
moving at this velocity will have a kinetic energy of $$ \textrm{KE} =
m c^2 \times \frac 1 2 \frac {v^2}{c^2} = 511 \textrm{ keV}
\times \frac 1 2 \frac {v^2}{c^2} \ \qquad \approx 511
\textrm{ keV} \times 0.8 \times 10^{-9} \approx 0.4 \times
10^{-3} eV. $$ So we can give an electron enough kinetic energy to get
to the moon with a voltage difference of 0.4 mV, assuming it doesn't hit
anything on the way up (it will). We can send an electron to the Moon!
How about a proton? Well, the mass of a proton is 1836x that of an
electron, but with the same charge, so we'd need 1836 * 0.4 mV \~ 0.73
V to get a proton to the Moon -- again, pretty easy. Continuing this
logic, we can send a singly-charged ion with mass 12 amu (<em>i.e.</em> C-)
with a 9V battery, and a singly-charged ion with mass 150 amu (something
like caprylic acid) using a 110V voltage drop. (Again, assuming these
don't hit anything on the way up.) How about our 10 kg object? Let's say
we can miraculously charge it with 0.01 C of charge. <a href="posts/old/earth-day-2012-escape-to-the-moon/#footnote-3">[3]</a>
Then from Eq. (1), we'd need $$ 0.01 C \times \Delta \Phi_E \approx
6 \times 10^8 \textrm{ J ,} $$ or a potential difference of $$
\Delta \Phi_E = 6 \times 10^{10} \textrm{ V. } $$ That is a HUGE
potential drop. For comparison, if we have 2 parallel plates with a
surface charge of 0.01 C/m^2 (again, a huge charge density), they'd
have to be a distance $$ d = 6 \times 10^{10} \textrm{V} \times
\epsilon_0 / (0.01 \textrm{C/m}^2) \approx 53 \textrm{ meters
apart} $$ It looks like I won't be able to send something to the Moon
using tools from my basement anytime soon.
[1] We'll ignore both air resistance and the Moon's gravitational
attraction for simplicity.
[2] Since the potential <em>U \~ - 1/r</em>, if we increase our potential
energy by 0.4%, this is (to 1st order) the same as increasing <em>r</em> by
0.4%. So we'll get 0.004 * 6378 km \~ 25 km above the Earth's surface.
Of course <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/dotphysics/2009/09/how-high-does-a-bullet-go.php">air resistance slows it down a
lot</a>.
[3] According to Wikipedia, this is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_%28charge%29">0.04% of the total charge of a
thundercloud</a>.
And if our object is uniformly charged with a radius of 1 m, it will
have an electrical self-energy of ** $$ U = \frac 1 2 \int
\epsilon_0 E^2 dV \approx 36 \textrm{kJ} $$</p>

  Five Hundred Mega Dollars, to be precise. (Image from Wikipedia)</p>
<hr>
<p>I am not typically interested in lotteries. They seem silly and I am
seriously beginning to question their usefulness in bringing about a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lottery">good harvest</a>. But this
morning I read in the news that the Mega Millions lottery currently has
a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Millions#Record_jackpots_.28listed_by_cash_value.29">world
record</a>
jackpot up for grabs. In fact, the jackpot is so big...</p>
<p>Tonight Show Audience: <em>HOW BIG IS IT?</em></p>
<p>**</p>
<p>It is <em>so big</em> that I decided to do a little bit of analysis on the
expected returns. Zing!</p>
<h3>Some Background</h3>
<p>First, a little background. The Mega Millions lottery is an aptly named
lottery in which numbered ping pong balls are pulled from a giant
rotating tub of randomization. Five of these are drawn from one tub of
56 balls, with no replacement. The sixth ball (the so-called "Mega
Ball") is drawn from a <em>separate</em>tub of 46 balls. To play, one picks 5
different numbers (1-56) for the regular draws and one number (1-46) for
the Mega Ball. The first five can match in any order, but the last ball
has to match with the Mega Ball. Prizes are given out based on how many
numbers you match. Stolen from the Mega Millions website, the prizes and
odds are given in the table below. The current jackpot is listed at $500
million (if taken in annuity) or $359 million if taken in an up-front
lump sum. It costs $1 dollar to play.</p>

<hr>
<p>Hot diggity daffodil, we're ready to get going!</p>
<h3>Expected Winnings</h3>
<p>Alright, so it costs $1 to play and we could potentially win $500
million. It sure <em>feels</em> like it is worth it to play (what's the harm?).
But we can do better than feelings, we have... MATH!</p>
<p>Since we have an exhaustive list of outcomes and their probabilities
(which is just the inverse of the big number in the "chances" column),
we can calculate the expectation value for our winnings. The expectation
value is just the sum over all the possible prize values times the
probability of winning that prize. In other words,</p>
<p>$$\langle W \rangle = \sum_i W_i \times p_i, $$</p>
<p>where we denote our expected winnings in angled brackets.</p>
<p>In essence, this value represents the average prize you would win if you
played this lottery over and over and over again (or played all the
combinations of numbers).</p>
<p>Setting the jackpot to $500 million, we can now compute the expected
winnings as</p>
<p>$$ \langle W \rangle = \frac{\$ 500,000,000}{175,711,536} +
\frac{\$ 250,000}{3,904,701} +\frac{\$ 10,000}{689,065} + \frac{\$
150}{15,313} + \frac{\$ 150}{13,781} $$</p>
<p>$$+ \frac{\$ 10}{844} + \frac{\$ 7}{306} + \frac{\$ 3}{141} +
\frac{\$ 2}{75}$$</p>
<p>A few flicks of the abacus later, we find that the expectation value of
our prize is</p>
<p>$$\langle W \rangle = \$ 3.02,$$</p>
<p>which means that after we subtract the dollar we paid for the ticket,
our expected return is $2.02.</p>
<p>But what if we had chosen to take our winnings as a lump sum of $359
million instead of the $500 million paid out over a span of 26 years? In
that case we find</p>
<p>$$\langle W \rangle = \$ 2.22,$$</p>
<p>which results in a $1.22 gain when we subtract the dollar we paid for
the ticket.</p>
<p>At least in a statistical sense for this particular jackpot, one is
better off playing than not playing. But are we forgetting anything?</p>
<h3>The Taxman</h3>
<p>If you win a $500 million jackpot, do you <em>really</em> get a $500 million
jackpot? Well, no. For winnings in a lottery over $5000, the IRS
<a href="http://www.irs.gov/instructions/iw2g/ar02.html#d0e401">withholds</a> 25%
in federal income taxes. Additionally, the winnings are subject to state
taxes as well. For example, if I were to win, the great state of New
York would be entitled to about 6.8% (apparently also just for winnings
above $5000).</p>
<p>After applying federal and state taxes to the prizes above $5000, we now
have an expected winnings of</p>
<p>$$ \langle W \rangle = \left[1-(0.25 +
0.068)\right]\times\left(\frac{\mbox{Jackpot}}{175,711,536} +
\frac{\$ 250,000}{3,904,701} +\frac{\$ 10,000}{689,065}\right) $$</p>
<p>$$+ \frac{\$ 150}{15,313} + \frac{\$ 150}{13,781}+ \frac{\$
10}{844} + \frac{\$ 7}{306} + \frac{\$ 3}{141} + \frac{\$
2}{75},$$</p>
<p>which gives an expected net win (minus the $1 for the ticket) of $1.10
for the $500 million annuity prize and $0.55 for the $359 million
up-front lump sum.</p>
<p>We're still in the black, but it's slowly slipping away. Is there
anything else we need to factor in? Well, yes. For one thing, winning
the jackpot qualifies us for the top tax bracket, so most of the
winnings would be taxed at the top marginal tax rate of 35%. Welcome to
the 1%, kids! <a href="posts/old/money-for-almost-nothing/#note">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>Changing the federal tax rate on the jackpot from 25% to 35% and
recalculating, we find net expected winnings of $0.81 for the $500
million annuity and $0.34 for the $359 million lump sum. Surprisingly,
it is still worth it in a statistical sense.</p>
<h3>Is it always like this?</h3>
<p>One thing to keep in mind as we make these estimates is that this is a
<em>historically large</em> jackpot. So even though it may be favorable to play
this time, this will not always be the case. In fact, we can find the
minimum jackpot value for which this is the case.</p>
<p>The condition in which our expected return is a gain (rather than a
loss) is</p>
<p>$$ \langle W \rangle - \$1.00 &gt; 0. $$</p>
<p>For simplicity, let's ignore the top marginal tax rate and just factor
in the 25% withholding and the 6.8% state tax. Solving for the minimum
jackpot using the expression for we found in the last section, we see
that</p>
<p>$$ \mbox{Jackpot}_{min} = \$217\~\mbox{million}.$$</p>
<p>Technically, this would have to be the amount actually awarded by the
payment method of your choice. The <em>stated</em> jackpot is always the
annuity method (because it looks higher). The lump sum offering is <em>at
most</em> about 70% of the stated jackpot. So if you want to take the lump
sum offering the <em>stated</em> jackpot will need to be</p>
<p>$$ \mbox{Jackpot}_{min} = \$217\~\mbox{million} / 0.7 =
\$310\~\mbox{million}.$$</p>
<p>In fact, these values are likely a bit low, since we have not included
the increase to the marginal tax rate, nor have we included other
effects like having to split a prize (which seems to happen a lot) or
inflation effects if you take the prize in yearly installments.</p>
<p>In any case, a quick look through the <a href="http://www.megamillions.com/winners/jackpothistory.asp">jackpot
history</a> shows
that these threshold values are only met occasionally. An eyeball
estimate puts about one jackpot per year that exceeds the (absolute)
minimum $217 million threshold.</p>
<h3>So am I going to win?</h3>
<p>No. No, you will not. BUT if you played record setting lotteries
hundreds of millions of times, you might see decent (\~10%) returns.
Although, it may just be easiest to, you know, <em>invest</em> that money.</p>
<h5>Only One Useless Footnote</h5>
<p>[1] Although, to be fair, the top marginal tax rate is currently at
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:MarginalIncomeTax.svg">historical
lows</a>. It could
always be worse... <a href="posts/old/money-for-almost-nothing/#back">[back]</a></p>

<p>Let me share my worst "best idea ever" moment. Sometime during my
undergraduate I thought I had solved all the world's problems. You see,
on this fateful day, my hard drive was full. I hate it when my hard
drive fills up, it means I have to go and get rid of some of my stuff. I
hate getting rid of my stuff. But what can someone do? And then it hit
me, I had the bright idea:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What if we didn't have to <em>store</em> things, what if we could just
<em>compute</em> files whenever we wanted them back?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like an awesome idea, right? I know. But how could we compute our
files? Well, as you may know pi is conjectured to be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_number">normal
number</a>, meaning its digits
are probably random. We also know that it is irrational, meaning pi
never ends.... Since its digits are random, and they never end, in
principle any sequence you could ever imagine should show up in pi
eventually. In fact there is a nifty website
<a href="http://pi.nersc.gov/">here</a> that will let you search for arbitrary
strings (using a 5-bit format) in first 4 billion digits, for example
"alemi" <a href="http://pi.nersc.gov/cgi-bin/pi.cgi?word=alemi&amp;format=char">seems to show
up</a> at around
digit 3149096356. So in principle, I could send you just an index, and a
length, and you could compute the resulting file. But wait you cry,
isn't computing digits of pi hard, don't people work really hard to
compute pi farther and farther? Hold on I claim, first of all, I'm
imagining a future where computation is cheap. Secondly, there is a
really neat algorithm, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey%E2%80%93Borwein%E2%80%93Plouffe_formula">BBP
algorithm</a>,
that enables you to compute the kth binary digit of pi without knowing
any of the preceding digits. In other words, in principle if you wanted
to know the 4 billionth digit of pi, you can compute it without having
to first compute the first 4 billion other digits. Cool, this is
beginning to sound like a really good idea. What's the catch? Perhaps
you've already gotten a taste of it. Let's try to estimate just how far
along in pi we would have to look before our message of interest shows
up. Let's assume we have written our file in binary, and are computing
pi in binary e.g.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>00100100 00111111 01101010 10001000 10000101 10100011 00001000
11010011</li>

<p>etc. So, if the sequence is random, there is a 1/2 chance that at any
point we get the right starting bit of our file, and then a 1/2 chance
we get the next one, etc. So the chance that we would create our file if
we were randomly flipping coins would be $$ P = \left( \frac{1}{2}
\right)^N = 2^{-N} $$ if our file was N bits long. So where do we
expect this sequence to first show up in the digits of pi? Well, this
turns out to be a <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CoinTossing.html">subtle
problem</a>, but we can get
a feel for it by assuming that we compute N digits of pi at a time and
see if its right or not. If its not, we move on to the next group of N
digits, if its right, we're done. If this were the case, we should
expect to have to draw about $$ \frac{1}{P} = 2^N $$ times until we
have a success, and since each trial ate up N digits, we should expect
to see our file show up after about $$ N 2^N $$ digits of pi. Great, so
instead of handing you the file, I could just hand you the index the
file is located. But how many bits would I need to tell you that index.
Well, just like we know that 10^3 takes 4 digits to express in decimal,
and 6 x 10^7 takes 8 digits to express, in general it takes $$ d =
\log_b x + 1 $$ digits to express a number in base b, in this case it
takes $$ d = \log_2 ( N 2^N ) + 1= \log_2 2^N + \log_2 N + 1 = N
+ \log_2 N + 1 $$ digits to express this index in binary. And there's
the rub. Instead of sending you N bits of information contained in the
file, all my genius compression algorithm has manged to do is replace N
bits of information in the file, with a number that takes ( \~ N +
\log_2 N ) bits to express. I've actually managed to make the files
larger not smaller! You may have noticed above, that even for the simple
case of "alemi", all I managed to do was swap the binary message</p>
<blockquote>
<p>alemi -&gt; 0000101100001010110101001 with the index 3149096356 -&gt;
10111011101100110110010110100100</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which is longer in binary! As an aside, you may have felt uncomfortable
with my estimation for how long we have to wait to see our message, and
you would be right. Just because all N digits I draw at a time don't
match up doesn't mean that the second half isn't useful. For instance if
I was looking for 010, lets say some of the digits are 101,010. While
both of those sequences didn't match, if I was looking at every digit at
a time, I would have found a match. And you'd be right. <a href="http://www.cs.elte.hu/~mori/cikkek/Expectation.pdf">Smarter people
than I</a> have
computed just how long you should have to wait, and end up with the
better estimation $$ \text{wait time} \sim 2^N N \log 2 $$ which is
pretty darn close to our silly estimate.</p>

<p>There is a very fast converging algorithm for computing pi that you can
do on a desktop calculator.</p>
<ul>
<li>Set x = 3</li>
<li>Now set x = x + sin(x)</li>
<li>Repeat</li>
</ul>
<p>This converges ridiculously fast, after 1 step you get 4 digits right,
after 2 steps you get 11 correct, in general we find:</p>
<hr>
<p># steps   Digits right
  1          4
  2          11
  3          33
  4          100
  5          301

  8          8124</p>
<hr>
<p>of course on a pocket calculator, you only need to do 2 steps to have an
accuracy greater than the calculator can display. To make this chart I
had to trick a computer into doing high precision arithmetic, the code
is <a href="https://gist.github.com/2038329">here</a>. Granted, this approximation
is really cheating, since sin is a hard function to compute, and
basically being able to compute sin means you know what pi is already.
Really, this is just <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_method">Newton's

root of sin(x) in disguise</p>

<p>Fun fact: pi squared is very close to 10. How close? Well, <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%2810+-pi%5E2+%29%2Fpi%5E2">Wolfram
Alpha</a>
tells me that it is only about 1% off. I first realized this fact when
looking at my slide rule, pictured to the left (click to embiggen), just
another reason why slide rules are awesome. It turns out I use this fact
all of the time. How's that you ask? Well, I use this fast to enable me
to do very quick mental arithmetic. It goes like this. For every number
you come across in a calculation, drop all of the information save two
parts, first, what's its order of magnitude, that is, how many digits
does it have, and second, is it closest to 1, pi, or 10? The first part
amounts to thinking of every number you come across as it looks in
scientific notation, so a number like 2342 turns into 2.342 x 10^3, so
that I've captured its magnitude in a power of 10. As for the next part,
the rules I usually use are:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the remaining bit is between 1 and 2, make it 1</li>
<li>If its between 2 and 6.5 make it pi</li>
<li>if its bigger than 6.5, make it another 10</li>
</ul>
<p>Another way to think of this is to estimate every number to be a power
of ten, and then either 1, a few, or 10. The reason I choose pi is
because if I use pi, I know how the rest of the arithmetic should work,
namely, I only need to know a few rules, plus when I use this to
estimate answers of physics formulae, making a bunch of pis show up
tends to help me cancel other natural pis that are in the formulae.</p>
<p>$$ \pi \times \pi \sim10 \qquad \frac{1}{\pi} \sim
\frac{\pi}{10} \qquad \sqrt{10} \sim \pi $$</p>
<p>Which you might notice is just the same approximation written in 3
different ways.</p>
<p>Let's work an example</p>
<p>$$ \begin{align<em>} 23 \times 78 / 13 \times 2133 &amp;= ? \ \pi
\times 10 \times 100 / 10 \times \pi \times 10^3 &amp;= ? \ \pi^2
\times 10^5 &amp;\sim 10^6 \ \end{align</em>}$$</p>
<p>of course the <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=23+*+78%2F13+*+2133">real
answer</a> is
294,354, so you'll notice I got the answer wrong, but I only got it
wrong by a factor of 3, which is pretty good for mental arithmetic, and
in particular mental arithmetic that takes no time flat.</p>
<p>In fact, the average error I introduce by using this approximation is
just 30% or so for each number, which I've shown below [the script that
produced this plot for those interested is
<a href="https://gist.github.com/2037431">here</a>].</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uwGlV6y_pps/T2C90lPhmQI/AAAAAAAAAbA/k_Hl8H-y2ys/s1600/pierr.png"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uwGlV6y_pps/T2C90lPhmQI/AAAAAAAAAbA/k_Hl8H-y2ys/s320/pierr.png"></a></p>
<p>So, there you go, now you can impress all of your friends with a simple
mental arithmetic that gets you within a factor of 3 or so on average.</p>

  My TV celebrates without me.</p>
<hr>
<p>Today, as I'm sure you're aware, is Pi Day - a day for the festive
consumption of pies and quiet self-reflection. In the spirit of the
holiday, I'd like to present a point for discussion: <em>Everyone has a
great talent for at least one thing.</em> That this is true for at least
<em>some</em> people is seen through even a cursory glance at a history book:
George Washington was really good at leading revolutions, Michelangelo
was an outstanding ceiling painter <a href="posts/old/moving-pi-ctures/#note1">[1]</a>, and Batman was the
best at solving complex riddles (especially in English, pero
<em>especialmente</em> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RY1U_pXUxUo&amp;feature=related">en
español</a>).
But I'm certain that this holds for everyone. What's your talent? Mine,
as those of you who read this blog should know very well by now, is
certainly <em>not</em> doing physics. Nope, my talent is watching TV. Seriously
guys, I watch TV like a boss <a href="posts/old/moving-pi-ctures/#note2">[2]</a>. In light of this talent, I
thought I would describe a few instances in which I have seen pi
represented (for better or for worse) in TV and movies. Over the last
few months, I have been re-watching a lot of the TV show
<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psych">Psych</a></em> with my good friend and
fellow Virtuosi contributor, Matt "TT" Showbiz <a href="posts/old/moving-pi-ctures/#note3">[3]</a>. For the
uninitiated, <em>Psych</em> is a detective show where the main characters
(Shawn and Gus) run a (fake) psychic detective agency, which allows them
to solve mysteries, engage in various shenanigans, and make an
inordinate number of references to <em>Tears for Fears</em> frontman Curt Smith
<a href="posts/old/moving-pi-ctures/#note4">[4]</a>. In one of the episodes, Shawn and Gus enter a room where
a long train of digits is written across the top of the wall. It soon
becomes evident that these are the digits of pi and the camera is sure
to zoom in on the famous first few digits to reassure us. But there are
hundreds of digits written out and I have very little faith in TV prop
people when it comes to background mathematical expressions. So I
decided to check it out.</p>
<hr>

  Pi on the Wall (click to enhance for texture)</p>
<hr>
<p>Using a neat little pi <a href="http://www.angio.net/pi/piquery">searcher</a>, I
checked to see if (and where) this sequence appeared in pi. Turns out
it's legit and (almost!) correct. The first 105 digits of pi (counting
after the three) are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510582097494459230781640628620899862803482534211706<strong>798</strong>2148</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where I have underlined the 99th, 100th, and 101st digits. Looking back
at the writing on the wall, we see that the 100th digit has been
duplicated.</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6vQ2gmfNULw/T17Nb29jAvI/AAAAAAAAAWA/2hMW9vdU3S0/s1600/pi_psych.png"><img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6vQ2gmfNULw/T17Nb29jAvI/AAAAAAAAAWA/2hMW9vdU3S0/s400/pi_psych.png"></a>
  Very Almost Pi</p>
<hr>
<p>So close! Oh well, nobody is perfect. Even though there is an error
here, I very much appreciate that whoever was doing the set design
decided to use the <em>actual</em> digits of pi. All too often I see
nonsensical equations in the background of TV shows and movies when it
would take <em>exactly the same</em> amount of work to put real equations
there. So congratulations to you, O nameless prop-making intern!, for
giving an accurate (well, to a part in 10^100) value of pi. Neat, so
are there any other TV shows or movies that have pi in them? Well,
there's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo18VIoR2xU">Pi</a>. <em>Pi</em> is film
by Darren Aronofsky (<em>Requiem for a Dream</em>, etc) about a mathematician
looking for patterns in the stock market. It's a pretty good movie with
a really cool
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cq_QO_4Cx4&amp;feature=player_embedded">soundtrack</a>
by Clint Mansell. It also appears to display the digits of pi in the
opening credits. But does it? To the Youtube-mobile! You can watch the
opening credits <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L61x5mbE-jc">here</a> if
you like and here is a still image of the relevant section.</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pEbkgRx-PFw/T17UHYdfhwI/AAAAAAAAAWI/vsyzWd139pg/s1600/sad_pi.png"><img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pEbkgRx-PFw/T17UHYdfhwI/AAAAAAAAAWI/vsyzWd139pg/s400/sad_pi.png"></a>
  Pi?</p>
<hr>
<p>Looks pretty cool, huh? But once we get past the slick aesthetics, we
see that something doesn't seem right. This number they are showing
appears at first glance to be our good friend pi, but after the 8th
digit the cover is blown and we see that this is actually some impostor
number!</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5afmhwZOhWk/T17U-d1okrI/AAAAAAAAAWQ/KB7NHwwOvQg/s1600/verysadpi.png"><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5afmhwZOhWk/T17U-d1okrI/AAAAAAAAAWQ/KB7NHwwOvQg/s400/verysadpi.png"></a>
  More like Darren Aron-wrong-sky.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now, I fully understand that this has no bearing whatsoever on the film
and, in the grand scheme of things, is not a Big Deal. But it would have
been just as easy to put the <em>real</em> digits of pi here instead of just
random filler. The only way that this could possibly be better than the
real deal would be if it is actually a secret code. I have not yet ruled
this out, as the movie is entirely about looking for meaning in
seemingly random numbers. Unfortunately, the difficulty in transcribing
the numbers from the screen greatly outweighs the very small chance that
this isn't just gibberish. Four hundred Quatloos to anyone who can tell
me if this is a code or not!</p>
