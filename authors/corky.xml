&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In less than two days, NASA's Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) / &lt;em&gt;Curiosity&lt;/em&gt; 
rover will begin its harrowing descent to the Martian
surface. If everything goes according to the
kind-of-crazy-what-the-heck-is-a-sky-crane plan, this process will be
referred to as "landing" (otherwise, more crashy/explodey gerunds will
no doubt be used). The MSL mission is run through NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory where, by coincidence, I happen to be at the moment. Now, I'm
not working on this project, so I don't have a lot to add that
&lt;a href="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/index.cfm"&gt;isn't&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2012/08/02/curiositys-chem-lab-on-mars/"&gt;available&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2012/07/20/43-years-later-were-seven-minutes-away-from-a-second-great-step-forward/"&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;.
BUT I do feel an authority-by-proximity kind of fallacy kicking in, so
how about a post why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Preliminaries&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get started, I feel obligated to link to NASA's 
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ki_Af_o9Q9s"&gt;Seven Minutes of Terror&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
video. If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend watching it right now (my
favorite part is the subtitles). It has over a million views on YouTube
and seems to have done a pretty good job at generating interest in the
mission. Although, it's a shame they had to interview the first guy in
what appears to be a police interrogation room. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;About the Rover&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thing is &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt;. It's the size of a car and is jam-packed with
&lt;a href="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/mission/instruments/"&gt;scientific equipment&lt;/a&gt;. 
There's a couple different spectrometers, a bunch of cameras, a drill for
collecting rock samples, and radiation detectors. Probably the coolest
instrument onboard &lt;em&gt;Curiosity&lt;/em&gt; is called the ChemCam. The ChemCam uses a
laser to vaporize small regions of rock, which allows it to study the
composition of things about 20 feet away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the scientific payload, &lt;em&gt;Curiosity&lt;/em&gt; also needs some way
to generate power. Previous rovers had been powered by solar panels, but
there don't appear to be any here. Instead, &lt;em&gt;Curiosity&lt;/em&gt; is
&lt;a href="http://www.ne.doe.gov/pdfFiles/MMRTG_Jan2008.pdf"&gt;powered&lt;/a&gt; 
by the heat released from the radioactive decay of about 10 pounds of plutonium
dioxide. This source will power the rover for 
&lt;strike&gt;about a Martian year&lt;/strike&gt;
well beyond the currently planned mission duration of one Martian year
(about 687 Earth days) [Thanks to Nathan in the comments for pointing
this out!].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize, the rover is a nuclear-powered lab-on-wheels that 
&lt;em&gt;shoots lasers out of its head&lt;/em&gt;. This is pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure style="width:70%"&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/images/a-curious-footprint/msl2.jpg" width="100%" alt="msl laser 2" align="center" style="margin:0px 0px 0px 0px"&gt;

   &lt;figcaption&gt;In non-SI units, the MSL is roughly one handsome man (1 hm) tall&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;A Curious Footprint&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's been a lot of preparation at JPL this week for the upcoming
landing. All the shiny rover models have been taken out of the visitor's
center and put in a tent outside, presumably so there will be a pretty
backdrop for press reports and the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I was out taking pictures of the rovers at the end of the day
today when someone pointed out something cool about the tires on
&lt;em&gt;Curiosity&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a close-up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure style="width:70%"&gt;
  &lt;img src="https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/images/a-curious-footprint/MSL_tire.jpg" width="100%" alt="msl tire" align="center" style="margin:0px 0px 0px 0px"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt; Hole-y Tires &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each tire on the rover is has "JPL" punched out in 
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:International_Morse_Code.svg"&gt;Morse code&lt;/a&gt;!
Makes sense, though. If you're going to spend $2.5 billion on something,
you might as well put your name on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Watch the Landing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to watch the landing, check out the 
&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/index.html"&gt;NASA TV stream&lt;/a&gt;. 
The landing is scheduled for Sunday night at 10:31 pm PDT (1:31 am EDT). Until then,
it looks like they are showing a lot of interviews and other cool
behind-the-scenes kind of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>curiosity</category><category>mars</category><category>MSL</category><category>scott bakula</category><guid>https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/old/a-curious-footprint/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 04 Aug 2012 04:56:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Tales from the Transit of Venus</title><link>https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/old/tales-from-the-transit-of-venus/</link><dc:creator>Corky</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div style="float: center;"&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Sad Old Sun&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is the transit of Venus, which, aside from being a totally rad
astronomical event, is also the perfect excuse to tell my favorite story
of an unlucky Frenchman (I have many). This is by no means new and, if
you've ever taken an astronomy course, you've probably already heard it.
It is perhaps the closest thing Astronomy has to a ghost story, told
though the glow of a flashlight on moonless nights to scare the
children. This is the story of Guillaume Le Gentil, a dude that just
couldn't catch a break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guillaume Joseph Hyacinthe Jean-Baptiste Le Gentil de la Galaisière was
a Frenchman with an incredibly long name. He was also an astronomer,
though he hadn't started out that way. Monsieur Le Gentil (as his
friends called him and so, then, shall we) had originally intended to
enter the priesthood. However, he soon began sneaking away to hear
astronomy lectures and quickly switched from studies of Heaven to those
heavens more readily observed in a telescope. Le Gentil happened to get
into the astronomy game at a very exciting time. The next pair of Venus
transits was imminent and astronomers were giddy with anticipation.
Though the previous transit of 1639 had been predicted, it was met with
little fanfare and only a few measurements. But the transits of 1761 and
1769 would be different. People would be ready. And the stakes were
higher this time, too. Soon after the 1639 transit, Edmund Halley (he of
the-only-comet-people-can-name fame) calculated that with enough
simultaneous measurements, the distance from the Earth to the Sun (the
so-called astronomical unit, or AU) could be measured fairly accurately.
Since almost all other astronomical distances were known in terms of the
AU, knowing its precise value would essentially set the scale for the
cosmos. Brand new telescopes in hand, the astronomers of Europe set sail
for locations all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le Gentil had been assigned to observe the transit from Pondicherry, a
French holding on the eastern side of India. On March 26th, 1760, he
began his long sea voyage around the Cape of Good Hope towards India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The voyage from France to India was a bit too long for the ship Le
Gentil hitched a ride on and he only made it as far as Mauritius (a
small island off Madagascar). Dropped off with all his equipment, Le
Gentil was left waiting for any ship at all to take him to Pondicherry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it was the Curse of the
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodo"&gt;Dodo&lt;/a&gt; or perhaps it was just bad
luck, but while he was waiting, Le Gentil learned that
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Years'_War"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; had broken out
between the French and the British, making a trip to British India very
difficult for a Frenchman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the monsoon season started, meaning that even if he could find a
ship, it would have to take a much longer route to India than initially
planned and that it would be very difficult to make the journey before
the transit occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, he caught dysentery for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, after months of waiting, Le Gentil (barely recovered from his
illness) left Mauritius for India in February of 1761. Though time
appeared to be running out, the captain of the ship he was on promised
he would be there to observe the transit in June. About halfway to
India, the winds switched directions and the ship was forced to turn
back to Mauritius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le Gentil dutifully observed the transit of Venus in 1761 from a rocky
ship in the middle of the Indian Ocean. The data were useless and he
never attempted any analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although he missed the first transit, these things come in pairs
separated by eight years. There was still another chance. And with all
this time to prepare, there was no way he was going to miss the second
one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, there was a bit &lt;em&gt;too much&lt;/em&gt; time. But as a world-traveling 18th
century man of science, Le Gentil had plenty of other interests to fill
his days. He was particularly interested in surveying the region around
Madagascar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So he made a really nice map of Madagascar. And then he ate some bad
kind of some kind of animal and came down with a terrible sickness. He
describes this illness and its "cure" in his journals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This sickness was a sort of violent stroke, of which several very
copious blood-lettings made immediately on my arm and my foot, and
emetic administered twelve hours afterwards, rid me of it quite
quickly. But there remained for seven or eight days in my optic nerve
a singular impression from this sickness; it was to see two objects in
the place of one, beside each other; this illusion disappeared little
by little as I regained my strength...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After recovering from both his sickness and the treatment, Le Gentil
decided to begin his preparations for the 1769 transit of Venus. He
calculated that either Manila or the Mariana Islands would be the ideal
spot to observe. The Sun would be relatively high in the sky at both
places when Venus passed by, meaning that the view would be through less
atmosphere with a reduced chance of clouds passing through the line of
sight. Le Gentil packed up his stuff and headed off to Manila, where he
could catch another ship to get to the Mariana Islands. Arriving in
Manila in 1766, the astronomer found himself exhausted from months of
sickness and sea-voyage. So, when he was offered passage on a ship
heading to the Mariana Islands, he quickly declined. That he chose not
to depart Manila at that time was perhaps his one stroke of good luck in
the entire journey. The ship sunk. Writing in his journal, Le Gentil
appears to have developed that particular sense of humor that generally
accompanies constant disappointment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is true that only three or four people were drowned, those who
were the most eager to save themselves, which is what almost always
happens in shipwrecks. I cannot answer that I would not have
increased the number of persons eager to save themselves.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, Le Gentil was in Manila with plenty of time to prepare for
the next transit. Unfortunately, the astronomer may have over-prepared.
Having arrived three years before the event, he now had three years to
worry and second-guess his decision. It didn't help that the Spanish
governor of Manila was kind of a crazy person. Not wanting to miss the
observation of a lifetime owing to the whims of mildly insane strong
man, Le Gentil packed up his stuff and headed to Pondicherry. Finally in
Pondicherry, Le Gentil worked tirelessly to construct his observatory
and make plenty of astronomical observations in preparation for the
event. He had state of the art equipment and had fully calibrated and
double checked everything. It was now nine years since his journey began
and only a few days until the transit was scheduled to occur at sunrise
on June 4th. The entire month of May was beautiful weather and pristine
observing conditions, as were the first few days of June. Le Gentil
likely went to bed on the 3rd of June fully confident that the next
morning would be no different. He woke up early in the morning to begin
preparations for his sunrise observations only to find clouds on the
horizon. The clouds remained, obscuring the sun, all through the
duration of the transit. A few hours after the end of the transit, the
sun broke through the clouds and remained visible for the rest of the
day. Le Gentil had missed his second transit in Pondicherry. He sums it
up in his journal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That is the fate which often awaits astronomers. I had gone more
than ten thousand leagues; it seemed that I had crossed such a great
expanse of seas, exiling myself from my native land, only to be the
spectator of a fatal cloud which came to place itself before the sun
at the precise moment of my observation, to carry off from me the
fruits of my pains and of my fatigues&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Manila, the Sun rose in perfectly clear skies. Distraught, Le Gentil
remained in bed for some weeks afterward. He soon caught a fever and
missed the ship that was supposed to take him home. He recovered, but
then came down with dysentery again. Barely recovered from his various
illnesses, he managed to get a ride back to Mauritius. He caught a ship
leaving the island in November of 1770. The ship was struck by a
hurricane and almost completely destroyed. It managed to limp back to
Mauritius. The second attempt proved more successful and Le Gentil
finally "set foot on France at nine o'clock in the morning, after eleven
years, six months and thirteen days of absence." Though he had finally
made it home, he was not out of the woods quite yet. In his absence, Le
Gentil's heirs had tried to declare him dead to gain their inheritance,
his accountant had mishandled (and lost) a large chunk of his holdings,
and the Academy of Sciences, which had sent him on his 11 year mission,
had given his seat to someone else. It was not quite the welcome home he
had hoped for. Despite his seemingly never-ending misfortune, things did
turn around for Le Gentil. He married, had a daughter, and was
reinstated into the Academy of Sciences. Presumably, he lived out the
rest of his days in relative happiness. Le Gentil died in 1792. Keeping
true to his style, this man who missed two of the most important
astronomical events of his time fortunately managed to also miss the
most important (and violent) &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reign_of_Terror"&gt;political
event&lt;/a&gt; of his time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have mainly used a very nice series of historical papers of Le
Gentil's misadventures with the transit of Venus written by Helen Sawyer
Hogg. The papers were originally published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the Royal
Astronomical Society of Canada&lt;/em&gt; and can be accessed through NASA's ADS

  Five Hundred Mega Dollars, to be precise. (Image from Wikipedia)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not typically interested in lotteries. They seem silly and I am
seriously beginning to question their usefulness in bringing about a
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lottery"&gt;good harvest&lt;/a&gt;. But this
morning I read in the news that the Mega Millions lottery currently has
a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Millions#Record_jackpots_.28listed_by_cash_value.29"&gt;world
record&lt;/a&gt;
jackpot up for grabs. In fact, the jackpot is so big...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight Show Audience: &lt;em&gt;HOW BIG IS IT?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is &lt;em&gt;so big&lt;/em&gt; that I decided to do a little bit of analysis on the
expected returns. Zing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Some Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a little background. The Mega Millions lottery is an aptly named
lottery in which numbered ping pong balls are pulled from a giant
rotating tub of randomization. Five of these are drawn from one tub of
56 balls, with no replacement. The sixth ball (the so-called "Mega
Ball") is drawn from a &lt;em&gt;separate&lt;/em&gt;tub of 46 balls. To play, one picks 5
different numbers (1-56) for the regular draws and one number (1-46) for
the Mega Ball. The first five can match in any order, but the last ball
has to match with the Mega Ball. Prizes are given out based on how many
numbers you match. Stolen from the Mega Millions website, the prizes and
odds are given in the table below. The current jackpot is listed at $500
million (if taken in annuity) or $359 million if taken in an up-front
lump sum. It costs $1 dollar to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Zi3rSfNqtuI/T3PHTEaXmvI/AAAAAAAAAXE/y9Hs7fqWrgs/s1600/crummy_table.gif"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Zi3rSfNqtuI/T3PHTEaXmvI/AAAAAAAAAXE/y9Hs7fqWrgs/s320/crummy_table.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  Don't worry about the asterisk. It just says CA is lame. (Source: &lt;a href="http://www.megamillions.com/howto/"&gt;Mega Millions&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hot diggity daffodil, we're ready to get going!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Expected Winnings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, so it costs $1 to play and we could potentially win $500
million. It sure &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; like it is worth it to play (what's the harm?).
But we can do better than feelings, we have... MATH!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we have an exhaustive list of outcomes and their probabilities
(which is just the inverse of the big number in the "chances" column),
we can calculate the expectation value for our winnings. The expectation
value is just the sum over all the possible prize values times the
probability of winning that prize. In other words,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\langle W \rangle = \sum_i W_i \times p_i, $$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where we denote our expected winnings in angled brackets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, this value represents the average prize you would win if you
played this lottery over and over and over again (or played all the
combinations of numbers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting the jackpot to $500 million, we can now compute the expected
winnings as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$ \langle W \rangle = \frac{\$ 500,000,000}{175,711,536} +
\frac{\$ 250,000}{3,904,701} +\frac{\$ 10,000}{689,065} + \frac{\$
150}{15,313} + \frac{\$ 150}{13,781} $$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$+ \frac{\$ 10}{844} + \frac{\$ 7}{306} + \frac{\$ 3}{141} +
\frac{\$ 2}{75}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few flicks of the abacus later, we find that the expectation value of
our prize is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\langle W \rangle = \$ 3.02,$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which means that after we subtract the dollar we paid for the ticket,
our expected return is $2.02.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if we had chosen to take our winnings as a lump sum of $359
million instead of the $500 million paid out over a span of 26 years? In
that case we find&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\langle W \rangle = \$ 2.22,$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which results in a $1.22 gain when we subtract the dollar we paid for
the ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least in a statistical sense for this particular jackpot, one is
better off playing than not playing. But are we forgetting anything?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Taxman&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you win a $500 million jackpot, do you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; get a $500 million
jackpot? Well, no. For winnings in a lottery over $5000, the IRS
&lt;a href="http://www.irs.gov/instructions/iw2g/ar02.html#d0e401"&gt;withholds&lt;/a&gt; 25%
in federal income taxes. Additionally, the winnings are subject to state
taxes as well. For example, if I were to win, the great state of New
York would be entitled to about 6.8% (apparently also just for winnings
above $5000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After applying federal and state taxes to the prizes above $5000, we now
have an expected winnings of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$ \langle W \rangle = \left[1-(0.25 +
0.068)\right]\times\left(\frac{\mbox{Jackpot}}{175,711,536} +
\frac{\$ 250,000}{3,904,701} +\frac{\$ 10,000}{689,065}\right) $$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$+ \frac{\$ 150}{15,313} + \frac{\$ 150}{13,781}+ \frac{\$
10}{844} + \frac{\$ 7}{306} + \frac{\$ 3}{141} + \frac{\$
2}{75},$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which gives an expected net win (minus the $1 for the ticket) of $1.10
for the $500 million annuity prize and $0.55 for the $359 million
up-front lump sum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're still in the black, but it's slowly slipping away. Is there
anything else we need to factor in? Well, yes. For one thing, winning
the jackpot qualifies us for the top tax bracket, so most of the
winnings would be taxed at the top marginal tax rate of 35%. Welcome to
the 1%, kids! &lt;a href="https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/old/money-for-almost-nothing/#note"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing the federal tax rate on the jackpot from 25% to 35% and
recalculating, we find net expected winnings of $0.81 for the $500
million annuity and $0.34 for the $359 million lump sum. Surprisingly,
it is still worth it in a statistical sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Is it always like this?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing to keep in mind as we make these estimates is that this is a
&lt;em&gt;historically large&lt;/em&gt; jackpot. So even though it may be favorable to play
this time, this will not always be the case. In fact, we can find the
minimum jackpot value for which this is the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The condition in which our expected return is a gain (rather than a
loss) is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$ \langle W \rangle - \$1.00 &amp;gt; 0. $$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For simplicity, let's ignore the top marginal tax rate and just factor
in the 25% withholding and the 6.8% state tax. Solving for the minimum
jackpot using the expression for we found in the last section, we see
that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$ \mbox{Jackpot}_{min} = \$217\~\mbox{million}.$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically, this would have to be the amount actually awarded by the
payment method of your choice. The &lt;em&gt;stated&lt;/em&gt; jackpot is always the
annuity method (because it looks higher). The lump sum offering is &lt;em&gt;at
most&lt;/em&gt; about 70% of the stated jackpot. So if you want to take the lump
sum offering the &lt;em&gt;stated&lt;/em&gt; jackpot will need to be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$ \mbox{Jackpot}_{min} = \$217\~\mbox{million} / 0.7 =
\$310\~\mbox{million}.$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, these values are likely a bit low, since we have not included
the increase to the marginal tax rate, nor have we included other
effects like having to split a prize (which seems to happen a lot) or
inflation effects if you take the prize in yearly installments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, a quick look through the &lt;a href="http://www.megamillions.com/winners/jackpothistory.asp"&gt;jackpot
history&lt;/a&gt; shows
that these threshold values are only met occasionally. An eyeball
estimate puts about one jackpot per year that exceeds the (absolute)
minimum $217 million threshold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So am I going to win?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. No, you will not. BUT if you played record setting lotteries
hundreds of millions of times, you might see decent (\~10%) returns.
Although, it may just be easiest to, you know, &lt;em&gt;invest&lt;/em&gt; that money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Only One Useless Footnote&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] Although, to be fair, the top marginal tax rate is currently at
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:MarginalIncomeTax.svg"&gt;historical
lows&lt;/a&gt;. It could
always be worse... &lt;a href="https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/old/money-for-almost-nothing/#back"&gt;[back]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>lottery</category><category>MEGABUCKS</category><category>scott bakula</category><guid>https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/old/money-for-almost-nothing/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Mar 2012 01:27:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Moving Pi-ctures</title><link>https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/old/moving-pi-ctures/</link><dc:creator>Corky</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

  My TV celebrates without me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, as I'm sure you're aware, is Pi Day - a day for the festive
consumption of pies and quiet self-reflection. In the spirit of the
holiday, I'd like to present a point for discussion: &lt;em&gt;Everyone has a
great talent for at least one thing.&lt;/em&gt; That this is true for at least
&lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; people is seen through even a cursory glance at a history book:
George Washington was really good at leading revolutions, Michelangelo
was an outstanding ceiling painter &lt;a href="https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/old/moving-pi-ctures/#note1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;, and Batman was the
best at solving complex riddles (especially in English, pero
&lt;em&gt;especialmente&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RY1U_pXUxUo&amp;amp;feature=related"&gt;en
español&lt;/a&gt;).
But I'm certain that this holds for everyone. What's your talent? Mine,
as those of you who read this blog should know very well by now, is
certainly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; doing physics. Nope, my talent is watching TV. Seriously
guys, I watch TV like a boss &lt;a href="https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/old/moving-pi-ctures/#note2"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;. In light of this talent, I
thought I would describe a few instances in which I have seen pi
represented (for better or for worse) in TV and movies. Over the last
few months, I have been re-watching a lot of the TV show
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psych"&gt;Psych&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; with my good friend and
fellow Virtuosi contributor, Matt "TT" Showbiz &lt;a href="https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/old/moving-pi-ctures/#note3"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;. For the
uninitiated, &lt;em&gt;Psych&lt;/em&gt; is a detective show where the main characters
(Shawn and Gus) run a (fake) psychic detective agency, which allows them
to solve mysteries, engage in various shenanigans, and make an
inordinate number of references to &lt;em&gt;Tears for Fears&lt;/em&gt; frontman Curt Smith
&lt;a href="https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/old/moving-pi-ctures/#note4"&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;. In one of the episodes, Shawn and Gus enter a room where
a long train of digits is written across the top of the wall. It soon
becomes evident that these are the digits of pi and the camera is sure
to zoom in on the famous first few digits to reassure us. But there are
hundreds of digits written out and I have very little faith in TV prop
people when it comes to background mathematical expressions. So I
decided to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sIqwUS9wlog/T17KQ7mU7nI/AAAAAAAAAV4/1hiiMuN-yxA/s1600/pi_psych1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sIqwUS9wlog/T17KQ7mU7nI/AAAAAAAAAV4/1hiiMuN-yxA/s400/pi_psych1.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  Pi on the Wall (click to enhance for texture)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a neat little pi &lt;a href="http://www.angio.net/pi/piquery"&gt;searcher&lt;/a&gt;, I
checked to see if (and where) this sequence appeared in pi. Turns out
it's legit and (almost!) correct. The first 105 digits of pi (counting
after the three) are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510582097494459230781640628620899862803482534211706&lt;strong&gt;798&lt;/strong&gt;2148&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where I have underlined the 99th, 100th, and 101st digits. Looking back
at the writing on the wall, we see that the 100th digit has been
duplicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6vQ2gmfNULw/T17Nb29jAvI/AAAAAAAAAWA/2hMW9vdU3S0/s1600/pi_psych.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6vQ2gmfNULw/T17Nb29jAvI/AAAAAAAAAWA/2hMW9vdU3S0/s400/pi_psych.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  Very Almost Pi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So close! Oh well, nobody is perfect. Even though there is an error
here, I very much appreciate that whoever was doing the set design
decided to use the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; digits of pi. All too often I see
nonsensical equations in the background of TV shows and movies when it
would take &lt;em&gt;exactly the same&lt;/em&gt; amount of work to put real equations
there. So congratulations to you, O nameless prop-making intern!, for
giving an accurate (well, to a part in 10^100) value of pi. Neat, so
are there any other TV shows or movies that have pi in them? Well,
there's &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo18VIoR2xU"&gt;Pi&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Pi&lt;/em&gt; is film
by Darren Aronofsky (&lt;em&gt;Requiem for a Dream&lt;/em&gt;, etc) about a mathematician
looking for patterns in the stock market. It's a pretty good movie with
a really cool
&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cq_QO_4Cx4&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded"&gt;soundtrack&lt;/a&gt;
by Clint Mansell. It also appears to display the digits of pi in the
opening credits. But does it? To the Youtube-mobile! You can watch the
opening credits &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L61x5mbE-jc"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; if
you like and here is a still image of the relevant section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pEbkgRx-PFw/T17UHYdfhwI/AAAAAAAAAWI/vsyzWd139pg/s1600/sad_pi.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pEbkgRx-PFw/T17UHYdfhwI/AAAAAAAAAWI/vsyzWd139pg/s400/sad_pi.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  Pi?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks pretty cool, huh? But once we get past the slick aesthetics, we
see that something doesn't seem right. This number they are showing
appears at first glance to be our good friend pi, but after the 8th
digit the cover is blown and we see that this is actually some impostor
number!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5afmhwZOhWk/T17U-d1okrI/AAAAAAAAAWQ/KB7NHwwOvQg/s1600/verysadpi.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5afmhwZOhWk/T17U-d1okrI/AAAAAAAAAWQ/KB7NHwwOvQg/s400/verysadpi.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  More like Darren Aron-wrong-sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I fully understand that this has no bearing whatsoever on the film
and, in the grand scheme of things, is not a Big Deal. But it would have
been just as easy to put the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; digits of pi here instead of just
random filler. The only way that this could possibly be better than the
real deal would be if it is actually a secret code. I have not yet ruled
this out, as the movie is entirely about looking for meaning in
seemingly random numbers. Unfortunately, the difficulty in transcribing
the numbers from the screen greatly outweighs the very small chance that
this isn't just gibberish. Four hundred Quatloos to anyone who can tell
me if this is a code or not!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[2] Yes, I am putting my TV watching skills on par with the talents of
George Washington. In fact, the stoic way in which I persevered through
the entirety of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator:_The_Sarah_Connor_Chronicles"&gt;The Sarah Connor
Chronicles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;in
under two weeks was described by historian David McCullough as
"Washingtonian." These are simply facts. &lt;a href="https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/old/moving-pi-ctures/#back2"&gt;[back]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people know a &lt;em&gt;suspiciously&lt;/em&gt; large number of the digits of pi.
Perhaps you have met one of these people. They can typically be found
hiding behind bushes and under the counters at pastry shops, just...
&lt;em&gt;waiting&lt;/em&gt;. At the slightest hint of a mention of pi, they will jump out
and start reciting the digits like there's a prize at the end. After
rattling off numbers for a few minutes they abruptly come to an end,
grin like an idiot, and walk away. It is an unpleasant encounter. The
sheer uselessness of this kind of thing has always bothered me, so I'd
like to set a preliminary upper bound on the number of digits of pi that
could ever possibly potentially kind of be useful (maybe). For those
following along at home, now would be a good time to put on your
numerology hats. Alright, so I hear this thing pi is fairly useful when
dealing with circles. Let's say we want to make a really big circle and
have its diameter only deviate by a very small amount from the correct
value. To do this successfully, we will have to know pi fairly well.
Let's take this to extremes now. Suppose I want to put a circle around
the &lt;em&gt;entire visible universe&lt;/em&gt; such that the uncertainty in the diameter
is the size of a &lt;em&gt;single proton&lt;/em&gt;. What would be the fractional
uncertainty in the circumference in this case? If we know pi exactly,
then we have that $$\delta C = \frac{\partial C}{\partial d} \delta
d = \pi \delta d = C \frac{\delta d}{d}, $$ where d is the diameter
and C is the circumference. In other words, the fractional uncertainty
in the circumference is just $$\frac{\delta C}{C} = \frac{\delta
d}{d}. $$ Using a femtometer for the size of a proton and 90 billion
light years for the size of the Universe &lt;a href="https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/old/a-very-small-slice-of-pi/#note"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;, we get
$$\frac{\delta C}{C} = \frac{\delta d}{d} =
\frac{10^{-15}\mbox{m}}{(90\times10^9)(3\times10^7\mbox{s})(3\times10^8\mbox{m
s}^{-1})} \sim\frac{10^{-15}}{10^{27}}\sim10^{-42}.$$ Alright, so
how well do we need to know pi to get a similar fractional uncertainty?
Well, we have that $$\frac{\delta \pi}{\pi} = \frac{\delta C}{C} =
10^{-42}, $$ so we can afford an uncertainty in pi of $$ \delta \pi =
\pi \times 10^{-42}$$ and thus we'll need to know pi to about 42
digits. How's that for an
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Answer_to_the_Ultimate_Question_of_Life.2C_the_Universe.2C_and_Everything_.2842.29"&gt;answer&lt;/a&gt;?
So if we have a giant circle the size of the &lt;em&gt;entire visible universe&lt;/em&gt;,
we can find its diameter to within the size of a &lt;em&gt;single proton&lt;/em&gt; using
pi to 42 digits. Therefore, I adopt this as the maximal number of digits
that could ever prove useful in a physical sense (albeit under a
somewhat bizzarre set of circumstances). If reciting hundreds of digits
is what makes you happy, go for it. But 42 digits is more than enough pi
for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] "But I thought the Universe was only 13.7 billion years! What voodoo
is this!?" Yeah, I know. See

  Farmer Uncle Sam...with a rifle. (Image Credit: Wikipedia)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was a sunny exception to the grey overcast rule of weather in
Ithaca. I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be overjoyed by this anomaly, spending the day
outside flying a kite or playing frisbee with a border collie in a
bandanna. Unfortunately, today was also the beginning of Daylight
Savings Time (DST) - my least favorite day of the year. For my
colleagues unfamiliar with this temporal travesty (I'm looking at you
Arizona), let me briefly explain DST. Once a year, the time lords steal
a single hour from us and place it in an escrow account for future
disbursement, presumably in some elaborate scheme to gain the favor of
hat-throwing farmer-clock hybrids (see image left). The details are a
bit murky, but the net result is that today I had one less hour to do my
very favorite thing in the whole wide world - sleep. It also means that
I have to set my watch, so I figured I'd check in and see how well my
&lt;a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2012/02/time-keeps-on-slippin.html"&gt;previous
model&lt;/a&gt;
for time-loss in my watch has held up. About a month ago, I looked at
how my watch slowly deviated from the &lt;a href="http://nist.time.gov/timezone.cgi?Eastern/d/-5/java"&gt;official
time&lt;/a&gt; (the original
post can be found
&lt;a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2012/02/time-keeps-on-slippin.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
and a helpful clarification by Tom can be found
&lt;a href="http://blogs.scienceforums.net/swansont/archives/11014"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Based
on a little over 50 days worth of data, I found that my watch lost about
0.35 seconds per day against the official time. About 50 days have
passed since my last measurement and today when I set the watch, so I
thought it would be interesting to see how well my model fit the new
data. The old data are presented in Figure 1 in blue, the old best fit
line is in red, and the new data point (taken this morning) is in green.
As always, click through the plot for a larger version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HqpuhvxXl8M/T1115Tz6lnI/AAAAAAAAAVQ/I1AUjQLXres/s1600/dst_update_long.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HqpuhvxXl8M/T1115Tz6lnI/AAAAAAAAAVQ/I1AUjQLXres/s400/dst_update_long.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  Figure 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new data point appears to be in fair agreement with the old best-fit
model, but it's a little hard to see here. Zooming in a bit, though, we
see that the model lies outside the error bar of the new data point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1euutOYSIrs/T1125Hi_XNI/AAAAAAAAAVY/tnWZ6N3mJJs/s1600/dst_update_short.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1euutOYSIrs/T1125Hi_XNI/AAAAAAAAAVY/tnWZ6N3mJJs/s400/dst_update_short.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  Figure 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So is this a big deal? Not really. But if it will help you sleep at
night, we can redo the fitting with the new data point included to see
how much things change. The the plots with the updated model to include
all data points are provided below with the old data in blue and the new
point in green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oIeLFmzJgKI/T115TGf3laI/AAAAAAAAAVg/RHPJuP9UrKk/s1600/dst_newfit_long.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oIeLFmzJgKI/T115TGf3laI/AAAAAAAAAVg/RHPJuP9UrKk/s400/dst_newfit_long.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  Figure 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new model looks a whole lot like the old one, except the best fit
line now appears to go through the new data point. Zooming in a little,
we see that it does indeed fall within the error bars of our new point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EUf50O2-jjQ/T11514CpS_I/AAAAAAAAAVo/Ryt2v1LOeVk/s1600/dst_newfit_short.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EUf50O2-jjQ/T11514CpS_I/AAAAAAAAAVo/Ryt2v1LOeVk/s400/dst_newfit_short.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  Figure 4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, so the new model fits with our new point, but how much did the
model have to change? Well, the fit to just the old data gave an offset
of 0.36 seconds and a loss rate of 0.35 seconds per day. The new model
has an offset of 0.40 seconds and a loss rate of 0.348 seconds per day.
Overall, not a significant change.
It looks as though I may continue to not worry about the accuracy of my
watch. I have set it to match the official time and have no intention of
fiddling with it until I have to set it again at the end of Daylight
Savings Time - my favorite day of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>casio</category><category>daylight savings time</category><category>scott bakula</category><guid>https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/old/f-91-revisited/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Mar 2012 00:57:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Time Keeps On Slippin'</title><link>https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/old/time-keeps-on-slippin-/</link><dc:creator>Corky</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

  This is picture of a watch. (Source: Wikipedia)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago, the Virtuosi Action Team (VAT) assembled for
lunch and the discussion quickly and unexpectedly turned to watches. As
Nic and Alemi argued over the finer parts of fancy-dancy watch
ownership, I looked down at my watch: the lowly &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_F91W"&gt;Casio
F-91W&lt;/a&gt;. Though it certainly
isn't fancy, it is inexpensive, durable, and could potentially win me an
all-expense paid trip to the
&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/25/guantanamo-files-casio-wristwatch-alqaida"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt;.
But how &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; of a watch is it? To find out, I decided to time it
against the official U.S. time for a couple of months. Incidentally,
about half-way in I found out that Chad over at &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/principles/"&gt;Uncertain
Principles&lt;/a&gt; had done essentially
the same thing
&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2011/05/the_testing_of_time_measuring.php"&gt;already&lt;/a&gt;.
No matter, science is still fun even if you aren't the first person to
do it. So here's my "new-to-me" analysis. Alright, so how do we go about
quantifying how "good" a watch is? Well, there seem to be two main
things we can test. The first of these is accuracy. That is, how close
does this watch come to the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; time (according to some time
system)? If the official time is 3:00 pm and my watch claims it is 5:00
am, then it is not very accurate. The second measure of "good-ness" is
precision or, in watch parlance, stability. This is essentially a
measure of the consistency of the watch. If I have a watch that is
consistently off by 5 minutes from the official time, then it is not
accurate but it is still stable. In essence, a very consistent watch
would be just as good as an accurate one, because we can always just
subtract off the known offset. To test any of the above measures of how
"good" my cheap watch is, we will need to know the actual time. We will
adopt the official U.S. time as provided on the &lt;a href="http://nist.time.gov/timezone.cgi?Eastern/d/-5/java"&gt;NIST
website&lt;/a&gt;. This time
is determined and maintained by a collection of really impressive atomic
clocks. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST-F1"&gt;One of these&lt;/a&gt; is in
Colorado and the other is secretly guarded by an ever-vigilant Time Lord
(see Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EXMf5o9a4GI/TzCRcaMjjVI/AAAAAAAAASs/FlqyjHbJS9Q/s1600/flavor_flav.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EXMf5o9a4GI/TzCRcaMjjVI/AAAAAAAAASs/FlqyjHbJS9Q/s320/flavor_flav.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  Figure 1: Flavor Flav, Keeper of the Time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 9:00:00 am EST on November 30th, I synchronized my watch with the
time displayed on the NIST website. For the next 54 days, I kept track
of the difference between my watch an the NIST time. On the 55th day, I
forgot to check the time and the experiment promptly ended. The results
are plotted below in Figure 2 (and, as with all plots, click through for
a larger version).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hscjUIehrHQ/TzCYqNhcsYI/AAAAAAAAATE/eAz3O5KlAcY/s1600/time_fit_short.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hscjUIehrHQ/TzCYqNhcsYI/AAAAAAAAATE/eAz3O5KlAcY/s400/time_fit_short.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  Figure 2: Best-fit to time difference&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see from Figure 2, the amount of time the watch lost over the
timing period appears to be fairly linear. There does appear to be a
jagged-ness to the data, though. This is mainly caused by the fact that
both the watch and the NIST website only report times to the nearest
second. As a result, the finest time resolution I was willing to report
was about half a second. Adopting an uncertainty of half a second, I did
a least-squares fit of a straight line to the data and found that the
watch loses about 0.35 seconds per day. As far as accuracy goes, that's
not bad! No matter what, I'll have to set my watch at least twice a year
to appease the Daylight Savings Gods. The longest stretch between
resetting is about 8 months. If I synchronize my watch with the NIST
time to "spring forward" in March, it will only lose about $$ t_{loss}
= 8\~\mbox{months} \times 30\frac{\mbox{days}}{\mbox{month}}
\times 0.35 \frac{\mbox{sec}}{\mbox{day}} = 84\~\mbox{sec} $$
before I have to re-synchronize to "fall back" in November. Assuming the
loss rate is constant, I'll never be more than about a minute and a half
off the "actual" time. That's good enough for me. Furthermore, if the
watch is &lt;em&gt;consistently&lt;/em&gt; losing 0.35 seconds per day and I know how long
ago I last synchronized, I can always correct for the offset. In this
case, I can always know the official time to within a second (assuming I
can add). But &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the watch consistent? That's a good question. The
simplest means of finding the stability of the watch would be to look at
the timing residuals between the data and the model. That is, we will
consider how "off" each point is from our constant rate-loss model. A
plot of the results is shown below in Figure 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-13ULtvOlXuU/TzCpp6LGvfI/AAAAAAAAATM/8rybD1lxZOo/s1600/residuals.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-13ULtvOlXuU/TzCpp6LGvfI/AAAAAAAAATM/8rybD1lxZOo/s400/residuals.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  Figure 3: Timing residuals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Figure 3, we see that the data fit the model pretty well. There's a
little bit of a wiggle going on there and we see some strong short-term
correlations (the latter is an artifact of the fact that I could only
get times to the nearest second). To get some sense of the timing
stability from the residuals, we can calculate the standard deviation,
which will give us a figure for how "off" the data typically are from
the model. The standard deviation of the residuals is $$ \sigma_{res}
= 0.19\~\mbox{sec}. $$ A good guess at the fractional stability of the
watch would then just be the standard deviation divided by the sampling
interval, $$ \frac{\sigma_{res}}{T} = 0.19\~\mbox{sec} \times
\frac{1}{1\~\mbox{day}} \times
\frac{1\~\mbox{day}}{24\times3600\~\mbox{sec}} \approx
2\times10^{-6}.$$ In words, this means that each "tick" of the watch
is consistent with the average "tick" value to about 2 parts in a
million. That's nice...but isn't there something &lt;em&gt;fancier&lt;/em&gt; we could be
doing? Well, I have been wanting to learn about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_variance"&gt;Allan
variance&lt;/a&gt; for some time
now, so let's try that. The Allan variance (refs: &lt;a href="http://www.ino.it/~azavatta/References/Allan.pdf"&gt;original
paper&lt;/a&gt; and a
&lt;a href="http://tf.boulder.nist.gov/general/pdf/118.pdf"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;) can be used to
find the fractional frequency stability of an oscillator over a wide
range of time scales. Roughly speaking, the Allan variance tells us how
averaging our residuals over different chunks of time affects the
stability of our data. The square root of the Allan variance,
essentially the "Allan standard deviation," is plotted against various
averaging times for our data below in Figure 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_zhCroHDoNE/TzC7XYkDZ1I/AAAAAAAAATU/mCaspxYhlxA/s1600/allan_variance.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_zhCroHDoNE/TzC7XYkDZ1I/AAAAAAAAATU/mCaspxYhlxA/s400/allan_variance.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  Figure 4: Allan variance of our residuals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Figure 4, we see that as we increase the averaging time from one
day to ten days, the Allan deviation decreases. That is, the averaging
reduces the amount of variation in the frequency of the data, making it
more stable. However, at around 10 days of averaging time it seems as
though we hit a floor in how low we can go. Since the error bars get
really big here, this may not be a real effect. If it is real, though,
this would be indicative of some low-frequency noise in our oscillator.
For those who prefer colors, this would be
"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colors_of_noise"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt;" noise. Since the
Allan deviation gives the fractional frequency stability of the
oscillator, we have that $$\sigma_A = \frac{\delta f}{f} =
\frac{\delta(1/t)}{1/t} = \frac{\delta t}{t}. $$ Looking at the
plot, we see that with an averaging time of one day, the fractional time
stability of the watch is $$\frac{\delta t}{t} \approx
2\times10^{-6}, $$ which corresponds nicely to our previously
calculated value. If we average over chunks that are ten days long
instead, we get a fractional stability of $$\frac{\delta t}{t}
\approx 10^{-7}, $$ which would correspond to a deviation from our
model of about 0.008 seconds. Not bad. The initial question that started
this whole ordeal was "How good is my watch?" and I think we can safely
answer that with "as good as I'll ever need it to be." Hooray for cheap
and effective electronics!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>allan variance</category><category>casio</category><category>scott bakula</category><guid>https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/old/time-keeps-on-slippin-/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 12 Feb 2012 22:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Stars Fell on Abe and Frederick</title><link>https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/old/the-stars-fell-on-abe-and-frederick/</link><dc:creator>Corky</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

  The 1833 Leonids (Source: Wikipedia)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Word on the street is there's a meteor shower set for late Tuesday
night, peaking at 2 am EST on January 4th &lt;a href="https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/old/the-stars-fell-on-abe-and-frederick/#footnote-1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/old/the-stars-fell-on-abe-and-frederick/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The
meteors in question are the
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrantids"&gt;Quadrantids&lt;/a&gt;, which often go
unnoticed for two good reasons. Reason the first: apparently
&lt;a href="https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/old/the-stars-fell-on-abe-and-frederick/#footnote-2"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/old/the-stars-fell-on-abe-and-frederick/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, they are usually pretty awful. Unlike the "good"
meteor showers, the Quadrantids are bright and pretty for only a few
hours (instead of a few days). This means that a lot of the time, we
just miss them. Reason the second: they have a lame name
&lt;a href="https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/old/the-stars-fell-on-abe-and-frederick/#footnote-3"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/old/the-stars-fell-on-abe-and-frederick/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But this year, they should be pretty good if the
weather is right. Now, there's lots of neat physics to talk about with
meteors, but that's not why I bring it up. This has all just been flimsy
pretext so I could share a historical anecdote about a meteor shower.
Trickery, indeed. Those who feel cheated are free to leave now with
&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apu_585SW18"&gt;heads held high&lt;/a&gt;. Those
still around (Hi, Mom!) will hear about the night in 1833 when the stars
fell on &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ibV3tCDvd8"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt; (and the
rest of the country, too). The
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonids"&gt;Leonids&lt;/a&gt; typically put on a
pretty good show, but their showing in 1833 was so dramatic that the
term "meteor shower" was coined to describe what was happening. The 1833
Leonids were truly one for the ages and made such an impression that
people were often able to remember when events happened by their
relation to the night when "the stars fell." It was in this use as a
"calendar anchor" that I first heard of this particular meteor shower.
While home for the holiday I was reading &lt;em&gt;Life and Times of Frederick
Douglass&lt;/em&gt;, one of the later autobiographies written by the former slave
and noted abolitionist. Recounting when he was moved from Baltimore to a
plantation on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, Douglass writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to St. Michaels to live in March, 1833. I know the year,
because it was the one succeeding the first cholera in Baltimore, and
was also the year of that strange phenomenon when the heavens seemed
about to part with their starry train. I witnessed this gorgeous
spectacle, and was awe-struck. The air seemed filled with bright
descending messengers from the sky. It was about daybreak when I saw
this sublime scene. I was not without the suggestion, at the moment,
that it might be the harbinger of the coming of the Son of Man; and in
my then state of mind I was prepared to hail Him as my friend and
deliverer. I had read that the "stars shall fall from heaven," and
they were now falling. I was suffering very much in my mind. It did
seem that every time the young tendrils of my affection became
attached they were rudely broken by some unnatural outside power; and
I was looking away to heaven for the rest denied me on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Douglass wrote these words almost 50 years after the fact and it is
evident that the meteor shower clearly had an effect on him. By this
time (at age 15), Douglass had already made up his mind to escape from
slavery. Three years later, he made a failed attempt. Two years after
that, in 1838, Frederick Douglass escaped to the North and became an
influential abolitionist. After reading the above passage from Douglass,
I wondered who else may have seen the 1833 Leonids. After a bit of
research, I found a paper by &lt;a href="http://ecommons.txstate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&amp;amp;context=physfacp&amp;amp;sei-redir=1&amp;amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fsa%3Dt%26rct%3Dj%26q%3Dolson%2Blincoln%2Bleonids%26source%3Dweb%26cd%3D1%26ved%3D0CB4QFjAA%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fecommons.txstate.edu%252Fcgi%252Fviewcontent.cgi%253Farticle%253D1004%2526context%253Dphysfacp%26ei%3DaogCT_2TB4rv0gGZ_5HoBw%26usg%3DAFQjCNE8HE4-k_Zcl2PzK2shdtMCi6ZyEQ#search=%22olson%20lincoln%20leonids%22"&gt;Olson &amp;amp; Jasinski
(1999)&lt;/a&gt;
which provides an excerpt from Walt Whitman recounting a story told by
Abraham Lincoln. Whitman writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the gloomiest period of the war, he [Lincoln] had a call from a
large delegation of bank presidents. In the talk after business was
settled, one of the big Dons asked Mr. Lincoln if his conﬁdence in the
permanency of the Union was not beginning to be shaken — whereupon the
homely President told a little story. “When I was a young man in
Illinois,” said he, “I boarded for a time with a Deacon of the
Presbyterian church. One night I was roused from my sleep by a rap at
the door, &amp;amp; I heard the Deacon’s voice exclaiming ‘Arise, Abraham, the
day of judgment has come!’ I sprang from my bed &amp;amp; rushed to the
window, and saw the stars falling in great showers! But looking back
of them in the heavens I saw all the grand old constellations with
which I was so well acquainted, ﬁxed and true in their places.
Gentlemen, the world did not come to an end then, nor will the Union
now."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham Lincoln witnessed the 1833 meteor shower and was still telling
stories about it 30 years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what's the point of this whole story? Is there any significance to
the fact that the man who escaped slavery to tell the world of its evils
and "The Great Emancipator" both saw the same meteor shower? Probably
not. Tons of people saw it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, it is interesting to think about. Though these men would
cross paths several times over the next 30 years, the earliest memory
they shared was of a night in 1833, when a 15 year old slave in Maryland
and a 24 year old boarder in Illinois watched the stars fall from the
sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] I use "Tuesday night" here to mean, of course, "Wednesday morning."
&lt;a href="https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/old/the-stars-fell-on-abe-and-frederick/#back-1"&gt;[back]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2] I say "apparently" because I have never heard of these guys before,
so this is all Wikipedia, baby! &lt;a href="https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/old/the-stars-fell-on-abe-and-frederick/#back-2"&gt;[back]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3] Like other meteor showers, the Quadrantids take their name from the
constellation from which the meteors seem to emerge. In this case,
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrans_Muralis"&gt;Quadrans Mural&lt;/a&gt;: The
Mural Quadrant. Unfortunately for Quadrans Mural, the constellations
dumped it like the planets dumped Pluto. &lt;a href="https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/old/the-stars-fell-on-abe-and-frederick/#back-3"&gt;[back]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/old/the-stars-fell-on-abe-and-frederick/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2012 20:02:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>How Long Will a Bootprint Last on the Moon?</title><link>https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/old/how-long-will-a-bootprint-last-on-the-moon-/</link><dc:creator>Corky</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

  Buzz Aldrin's bootprint (source: Wikipedia)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago, I stumbled across a bunch of
&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/revisited/index.html"&gt;pictures&lt;/a&gt;
of Apollo landing sites taken by one of the cameras onboard the Lunar
Reconnaissance Orbiter. The images have a resolution high enough that
you can resolve features on the surface down to about a meter. Looking
at the Apollo 17 &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/584392main_M168000580LR_ap17_area.jpg"&gt;landing
site&lt;/a&gt;,
you can see the trails of both astronauts and a moon buggy. It's pretty
cool. It also got me thinking about how long the landing sites would be
preserved. More specifically, I want to know how long Buzz Aldrin's
right bootprint (shown, incidentally, to the left) will last on the
Moon. Since the Moon has no atmosphere, the wind and rain that would
weather away a similar bootprint here on Earth are not present and it
seems as though the print would last a really long time. But how long?
Let's try to quantify it &lt;a href="https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/old/how-long-will-a-bootprint-last-on-the-moon-/#footnote-yariv"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/old/how-long-will-a-bootprint-last-on-the-moon-/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Pick Your Poison
Before we get going, we need to figure out what physical process would
be most important in erasing a bootprint from the Moon. Although the
Moon lacks the conventional "weathering" we experience on Earth (due to
wind, rain, etc), it does experience something called "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_weathering"&gt;space
weathering&lt;/a&gt;." Space
weathering is the changing of the lunar surface due to cosmic rays,
micrometeorite collisions, regular meteorite collisions, and the solar
wind &lt;a href="https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/old/how-long-will-a-bootprint-last-on-the-moon-/#footnote-wind"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/old/how-long-will-a-bootprint-last-on-the-moon-/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Of these phenomena, the most apparent
and well-studied would be the meteorites which have covered the Moon in
craters. We adopt the meteorite impact as our primary means of wiping
out a bootprint and restate our question as follows: "How long would it
take for a meteorite to hit the Moon such that the resulting crater
wipes out Aldrin's right bootprint?" Background As it is currently
stated, we can answer our question if we knew the rate of formation and
size distribution of the craters on the Moon. We could count up all the
craters on the Moon (or a particular region of interest) and tabulate
their sizes. This would give us the size distribution. It would also
give us a headache and potentially drive us to lunacy
&lt;a href="https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/old/how-long-will-a-bootprint-last-on-the-moon-/#footnote-forced"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://thephysicsvirtuosi.com/posts/old/how-long-will-a-bootprint-last-on-the-moon-/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Luckily, someone has beat us to it. &lt;a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1966MNRAS.134..245C"&gt;Cross
(1966)&lt;/a&gt; used images
from the Ranger 7 and 8 missions to count craters and determine the size
distribution of craters in three regions of the Moon. The data for the
crater distribution in the Sea of Tranquility (where Apollo 11 landed)
are given in the figure below. Cross found that in the Sea of
Tranquility, the number of craters with diameters greater than X meters
(per million square kilometers) is given by: $$ N(d&amp;gt;X) =
10^{10}\left(\frac{X}{1\~\mbox{m}}\right)^{-2}, $$ which holds for
craters with diameters between 1 meter and 10 kilometers (see figure
below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kHxcn_PTd5o/TwDg3XGAcqI/AAAAAAAAARg/jl-kb22JD-Y/s1600/fig2.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kHxcn_PTd5o/TwDg3XGAcqI/AAAAAAAAARg/jl-kb22JD-Y/s400/fig2.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  Figure 2 from Cross (1966)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also estimate the rate at which craters are formed from this
data. If we assume that the craters formed at a constant rate over the
age of the Moon (about 4 billion years), then we get about 2.5 craters
with diameters above 1 meter formed in a million square kilometer area
every year. This is a "crater flux" for the Moon. Written another way,
the crater flux in the Sea of Tranquility is $$F \approx
1\~{\mbox{km}}^{-2} \frac{1}{4\times10^5\~\mbox{yr}}, $$ so we get
that roughly one crater with diameter greater than 1 meter is formed on
a square kilometer of the Moon once every 400,000 years or so. We now
have enough information to do some simulations. Simulation I wrote up a
code that simulates craters being formed on a 1 square kilometer patch
of the Moon. A crater is randomly placed in the 1 square kilometer
region with a diameter pulled from the above distribution. The bootprint
is placed at the center of the grid and craters are formed until we get
a "hit." At that point, the time is recorded and the run stops. As a
sanity check, I thought it would be fun to just let the simulation run
without caring if the boot was hit or not. By simulating the craters in
this way for 4 billion years, I should get something that looks like the
Moon at the present day. Here's a 200 m square from my simulation:

&lt;p&gt;Just eyeballing it, things look pretty good. Now it's time for the
actual simulation. I ran the simulation 10,000 times and tabulated the
amount of time needed before the bootprint was hit. The figure below
gives the
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function"&gt;CDF&lt;/a&gt; for
the hit times in the simulation. That is, for each time T, we find the
fraction of simulations in which the bootprint got hit in a time less
than or equal to T. The dashed lines in the plot indicate the amount of
time needed to pass for half of the simulations to have recorded a hit.
This time turns out to be about 24 billion years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusions and Caveats Based on the simulations, the bootprint on the
Moon would have about even odds of lasting at least 20 billion years
&lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; the primary means of destruction is through the formation of a
crater from a meteorite. However, there are a few caveats that should be
addressed. These deal with either the details of the simulation or the
assumptions we have made. In the simulation, we just took at 1 km square
patch of the moon and scaled back the "crater flux" accordingly.
However, this does not fully account for all possible craters that can
form. For example, our simulation would miss an event that hit 50 km
away from the target, but had a diameter of 100 km. Obviously this would
hit the target, but we are only seeding craters in the 1 square km
region. This would mean that the actual lifetime of the bootprint would
be less than our 24 billion year figure. Re-running with a 10km by 10km
square region, we find a lifetime of 18 billion years. Thus, an increase
in area by a factor of 100 only reduces the age by 25%. Considering
areas much larger than this makes the simulation prohibitively slow, but
the order unity effect does not seem too significant. Additionally, we
have made a number of assumptions. The big one is that we have assumed
that the craters currently seen on the Moon were formed uniformly in
time. In fact, a large fraction of the craters may have been formed when
the Moon was still very young (see &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Heavy_Bombardment"&gt;Late Heavy
Bombardment&lt;/a&gt;). If
this were the case, we would have greatly overestimated the rate of
crater formation and thus underestimated the time needed to hit the
bootprint. In spite of these caveats, let's take our value of 20 billion
years to be accurate. What else can we say? Well, if we are right then
we are wrong because the Moon may not last that long (and it's hard to
have bootprints on the Moon without a Moon). Current
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun#Life_cycle"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; have that the
Sun will expand into a red giant and (potentially) destroy the Earth
(and the Moon) in about 5 billion years. So a record of the Apollo
astronauts' boot sizes could potentially last as long as the Moon

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Update: Prize Update / Added link to full solutions&lt;/em&gt;] Welcome to the
second Physics Challenge Award show!
[APPLAUSE]
Our judges have deliberated for several units of time and I now have in
my hands the envelope holding our list of winners. I could easily just
tell you who won right now and save everyone some time, but award shows
need some suspense to work effectively, so let's first give some tedious
background information!
[APPLAUSE]
You may recall that the winner of the first &lt;a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2011/03/physics-challenge-award-show.html"&gt;Physics
Challenge&lt;/a&gt;
contest won a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRC_Handbook_of_Chemistry_and_Physics"&gt;CRC
Handbook&lt;/a&gt;.
We will not be giving out CRCs this time around. We felt that such a
prize was far too &lt;del&gt;expensive&lt;/del&gt; impersonal, so we have opted this year
for something &lt;del&gt;much cheaper&lt;/del&gt; from the heart. The following prizes will
be awarded to our top three solutions:
&lt;strong&gt;First Prize:&lt;/strong&gt; Our first prize winner will receive an actual
back-of-an-envelope used in one of our posts (gasp!) signed by all the
of the members of the Virtuosi that I can find at colloquium tomorrow.
But that's not all! Alemi will also salute in your general direction.
&lt;strong&gt;Second Prize:&lt;/strong&gt; For our second prize winner, we appear to have run out
of envelopes... but Alemi will still salute in your general direction.
You will not see him do this, but you will feel a major disturbance in
the Awesome Force (mediated, of course, through the midi-chlorian
boson).
&lt;strong&gt;Third Prize:&lt;/strong&gt; You will receive no material prize, but on your
deathbed you will receive &lt;em&gt;total consciousness&lt;/em&gt;. So you've got that
going for you, which is nice.
Let's first remind everyone what the Challenge problem was. The full
text of the problem can be found
&lt;a href="http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~aalemi/challenge/timemachine.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;,
but the gist is basically this: You've created a time machine and you're
biggest fear is that you'll be stuck back in the past without any way to
communicate to the future that your design worked and you deserve all
kinds of Nobel prizes. The solution should be able to last long periods
of time (who knows how far back in time you'll go?), should maximize the
chances of modern people finding it, and be able to convince people that
you have in fact gone back in time.
Alright, let's get to some solutions already!
&lt;strong&gt;First Place:&lt;/strong&gt; The first place solution comes from Christian, who uses
some biological wrangling to solve the time traveller conundrum. With
some information from the
&lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/craig_venter_unveils_synthetic_life.html"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt;
of "synthetic life" and some bio how-to from an entity known only as
"steve," Christian plans to implant a message into the DNA of bacteria.
The message will contain his name, identifying information, and the url
of a website which will (presumably) contain a video of him with one
hand outstretched saying "Nobel prize please."
Let's see how this solution satisfies our criteria for a successful
solution. &lt;em&gt;Does it work for an arbitrary amount of time?&lt;/em&gt; It appears to,
so long as the bacteria manage to survive and the message doesn't become
too garbled over time (perhaps some error-correction might be useful).
Additionally, if one is worried about introducing non-native bacteria to
the wild you could bring back a bunch of bacteria that were known to
exist over wide periods of time and just release those alive at the
time. &lt;em&gt;Will modern humans find it?&lt;/em&gt; It seems that geneticists are
decoding just about any genome they can get their hands on, so this is a
strong possibility. &lt;em&gt;Would it convince people that someone travelled in
time?&lt;/em&gt; If the bacteria has dispersed enough, shows enough variation over
geographic regions, and contains specific identifying information about
a missing person who has allegedly created a time machine, I think
that's pretty strong evidence. Neato, gang!
&lt;strong&gt;Second Place:&lt;/strong&gt; The second place solution comes from Kyle, who offers
a space-based answer. Kyle suggests etching detailed plans of the time
travel mechanism (flux capacitor) onto a durable metal and putting that
bad boy into space. He suggests that anyone capable of building a fully
functional time machine should have no problem launching a small
satellite. Fair enough. Additionally, the satellite would use some kind
of solar power or the like to produce a low-power radio signal. In fact,
this signal would only need to spit something out once every year or ten
years or something. Since radio communication precedes space
exploration, the detection of an artificial satellite sending a message
would attract a fair deal of attention. The plans and successful
reproduction of the time machine would then seal the deal.
Does this solution satisfy the necessary conditions? I think so.
Assuming all goes according to plan, this would easily be detected by
modern people and, assuming the time machine plans are accurate, would
provide indisputable proof. My main concern would be that the satellite
could be launched and survive to the present. Modern satellites need
constant boosts to stay in orbit, without which they fall back onto
Earth and burn up. One potential solution would be to put it on the
Moon. This is technically much more difficult, but hey, you just created
a time machine! Also, putting it on the moon then allows for a totally
rad recreation of the
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolith_(Space_Odyssey)"&gt;Monolith&lt;/a&gt; scene
in &lt;em&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;strong&gt;Third Place:&lt;/strong&gt; The third place solution comes from Yariv. Though Yariv
did not submit a solution through the proper channels (he follows no
one's rules, not even his own), he was overheard to give a solution.
While the Physics Challenge planning committee was discussing the
problem over lunch, Yariv flippantly dismissed the entire premise as
"trivial" and suggested a two-word solution: "radioactive paint."
Personally, I like the idea of bewildered archaeologists finding a cave
painting of Yariv riding a dinosaur done using a variety of radioactive
paints which all date back 200 million years. For this amusement, I
award Yariv the third place prize for this contest. As a member of the
Virtuosi, however, Yariv is ineligible to receive a prize and instead
receives 5 demerits on his record for his willful disregard of our
institution's rules and excessive flippancy. One more slip-up and you'll
lose your badge!
