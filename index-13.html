<p>Recently I set out to hold a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)">Battleship</a> programming
tournament here among some of the undergraduates. Naturally, I myself
wanted to win. So, I got to thinking about the game, and developed what
I like to call "the linear theory of battleship". A demonstration of the
fruits of my efforts can be found
<a href="http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~aalemi/battleship/">here</a>. Below, my
aim is to guide you through how I developed this theory, as an exercise
in using physics to solve an interesting unknown problem. This is one of
the things I really love about physics, the fact that obtaining an
education in physics is essentially an education in reasoning and
thinking through complicated problems, along with an honestly short list
of tips and tricks that have proven successful for tackling a wide range
of problems. So, how do we develop the linear theory of battleship?
First we need to quantify what we know, and what we want to know.</p>
<h4>The Goal</h4>
<p>So, how does one win Battleship? Since the game is about sinking your
opponents ships before they can sink yours, it would seem that a good
strategy would be to try to maximize your probability of getting a hit
every turn. Or, if we knew the probabilities of there being a hit on
every square, we could guess each square with that probability, to keep
things a little random. So, let's try to represent what we are after. We
are after a whole set of numbers $$ P_{i,\alpha} $$ where i ranges
from 0 to 99 and denotes a particular square on the board, and alpha can
take the values C,B,S,D,P for carrier, battleship, submarine, destroyer,
and patrol boat respectively. This matrix should tell us the probability
of there being the given ship on the given square. E.g. $$ P_{53,B} $$
would be the probability of there being a battleship on the 53rd square.
If we had such a matrix, we could figure out the probability of there
being at hit on every square by summing over all of the ships we have
left, i.e. $$ P_i = \sum_{\text{ships left}} P_{i, \alpha } $$</p>
<h4>The Background</h4>
<p>Alright, we seem to have a goal in mind, now we need to quantify what we
have to work with. Minimally, we should try to measure the probabilities
for the ships to be on each square given a random board configuration.
Let's codify that information in another matrix $$ B_{i,\alpha} $$
where B stands for 'background', i runs from 0 to 99, and alpha is
either C,B,S,D, or P again, and stands for a ship. This matrix should
tell us the probability of a particular ship being on a particular spot
on the board assuming our opponent generated a completely random board.
This is something we can measure. In fact, I wrote a little code to
generate random Battleship boards, and counted where each of the ships
appeared. I did this billions of times to get good statistics, and what
I ended up with is a little interesting. You can see the results for
yourself over at my <a href="http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~aalemi/battleship/">results exploration
page</a> by changing
the radio buttons for the ship you are interested in, but I have some
screen caps below. Click on any of them to embiggen.</p>
<h5>All</h5>
<p>First of all, lets look at the sum of all of the ship probabilities, so
that we have the probability of getting a hit on any square for any ship
given a random board configuration, or in our new parlance $$ B_i =
\sum_{\alpha={C,B,S,D,P} } B_{i,\alpha} $$ The results:</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-G-vGF0DUOgM/Tokf-JE6AAI/AAAAAAAAAXU/Oyk1qlj3tKQ/s1600/all.png"><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-G-vGF0DUOgM/Tokf-JE6AAI/AAAAAAAAAXU/Oyk1qlj3tKQ/s200/all.png"></a></p>
<p>shouldn't be too surprising. Notice first that we can see that my
statistics are fairly good, because our probabilities look more or less
smooth, as they ought to be, and show nice left/right up/down symmetry,
which it ought to have. But as you'll notice, on the whole there is
greater probability to get a hit near the center of the board than near
the edges, an especially low probability of getting a hit in the
corners. Why is that? Well, there are a lot more ways to lay down a ship
such that there is a hit in a center square than there are ways to lay a
ship so that it gives a hit in a corner. In fact, for a particular ship
there are only two ways to lay it so that it registers a hit in the
corner. But, for a particular square in the center, for the Carrier for
example there are 5 different ways to lay it horizontally to register a
hit, and 5 ways to lay it vertically, or 10 ways total. Neat. We see
entropy in action.</p>
<h5>Carrier</h5>
<p>Next let's look just at the Carrier:</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CPYGjQCZbgA/Tokf-e0oKPI/AAAAAAAAAXk/hjfU3YgFkQk/s1600/carrier.png"><img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CPYGjQCZbgA/Tokf-e0oKPI/AAAAAAAAAXk/hjfU3YgFkQk/s200/carrier.png"></a></p>
<p>Woah. This time the center is very heavily favored versus the edges.
This reflects the fact that the Carrier is a large ship, occupying 5
spaces, basically no matter how you lay it, it is going to have a part
that lies near the center.</p>
<h5>Battleship</h5>
<p>Now for the Battleship:</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6On4gLpSBUM/Tokf-EyNHZI/AAAAAAAAAXc/lp5mxbYeAo0/s1600/battleship.png"><img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6On4gLpSBUM/Tokf-EyNHZI/AAAAAAAAAXc/lp5mxbYeAo0/s200/battleship.png"></a></p>
<p>This is interesting. This time, the most probable squares are not the
center ones, but the not quite center ones. Why is that? Well, we saw
that for the Carrier, the probability of finding it in the center was
very large, and so respectfully, our battleship cannot be in the center
as often, as a lot of the time it would collide with the Carrier. Now,
this is not because I lay down the Carrier first, my board generation
algorithm assigns all of the boards at once, and just weeds out invalid
ones, this is a real entropic effect. So here we begin to see some
interesting Ship-Ship interactions in our probability distributions. But
notice again that on the whole, the battleship should also be found near
the center as it is also a large ship.</p>
<h5>Sub / Destroyer</h5>
<p>Next let's look at the sub / destroyer. First thing to note is that our
plot should be the same for both of these ships as they are both the
same length.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hF3iyCrPVq8/Tokf-p_R5_I/AAAAAAAAAXs/FxaAiGmzq4Q/s1600/sub.png"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hF3iyCrPVq8/Tokf-p_R5_I/AAAAAAAAAXs/FxaAiGmzq4Q/s200/sub.png"></a></p>
<p>Here we see an even more pronounced effect near the center. The Subs and
Destroyers are 'pushed' out of the center because the Carriers and
Battleships like to be there. This is a sort of entropic repulsion.</p>
<h5>Patrol Boat</h5>
<p>Finally, let's look at the patrol boat:</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-i8FNLK7mPII/Tokf-vkEtHI/AAAAAAAAAX0/FcIr6D9zNCo/s1600/patrol.png"><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-i8FNLK7mPII/Tokf-vkEtHI/AAAAAAAAAX0/FcIr6D9zNCo/s200/patrol.png"></a></p>
<p>The patrol boat is a tiny ship. At only two squares long, it can fit in
just about anywhere, and so we see it being strongly affected by the
affection the other ships have for the center. Neat stuff. So, we've
experimentally measured where we are likely to find all of the
battleship ships if we have a completely random board configuration.
Already we could use this to make our game play a little more effective,
but I think we can do better.</p>
<h4>The Info</h4>
<p>In fact, as a game of battleship unfolds, we learn a good deal of
information about the board. In fact on every turn we get a great deal
of information about a particular spot on the board, our guess. Can we
incorporate this information into our theory of battleship? Of course we
can, but first we need to come up with a good way to represent this
information. I suggest we invent another matrix! Let's call this one $$
I_{j,\beta} $$ Where I is for 'information', j goes from 0 to 99 and
beta marks the kind of information we have about a square, let's let it
take the values M,H,C,B,S,D,P, where M means a miss, H means a hit, but
we don't know which ship, and CBSDP mark a particular ship hit, which we
would know once we sink a ship. This matrix will be a binary one, where
for any particular value of j, the elements will all be 0 or 1, with
only one 1 sitting at the spot marking our information about the square,
if we have any. That was confusing. What do I mean? Well, let's say its
the start of the game and we don't know a darn thing about spot 34 on
the board, then I would set $$
I_{34,M}=I_{34,H}=I_{34,C}=I_{34,B}=I_{34,S}=I_{34,D}=I_{34,P}=0
$$ that is, all of the columns are zero because we don't have any
information. Now let's say we guess spot 34 and are told we missed, now
that row of our matrix would be $$ I_{34,M} = 1 \quad
I_{34,H}=I_{34,C}=I_{34,B}=I_{34,S}=I_{34,D}=I_{34,P}=0 $$ so that
we put a 1 in the column we know is right, instead, if we were told it
was a hit, but don't know which ship it was: $$ I_{34,H} = 1 \quad
I_{34,M}=I_{34,C}=I_{34,B}=I_{34,S}=I_{34,D}=I_{34,P}=0 $$ and
finally, lets say a few turns later we sink our opponents sub, and we
know that spot 34 was one of the spots the sub occupied, we would set:
$$ I_{34,S} = 1 \quad
I_{34,M}=I_{34,H}=I_{34,C}=I_{34,B}=I_{34,D}=I_{34,P}=0 $$ This
may seem like a silly way to codify the information, but I promise it
will pay off. As far as my <a href="http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~aalemi/battleship/">Battleship Data
Explorer</a> goes,
you don't have to worry about all this nonsense, instead you can just
click on squares to set their information content. Note: shift-clicking
will let you cycle through the particular ships, if you just regular
click it will let you shuffle between no information, hit, and miss.</p>
<h4>The Theory</h4>
<p>Alright if we decide to go with my silly way of codifying the
information, at this point we have two pieces of data, $$ B_{i,\alpha}
$$ our background probability matrix, and $$ I_{j,\beta} $$ our
information matrix, where what we want is $$ P_{i,\alpha} $$ the
probability matrix. Here is where the linear part comes in. Why don't we
adopt the time honored tradition in science of saying that the
relationship between all of these things is just a linear one? In matrix
language that means we will choose our theory to be $$ P_{i,\alpha} =
B_{i,\alpha} + \sum_{j=[0,..,99],\beta={M,H,C,B,S,D,P}}
W_{i,\alpha,j,\beta} I_{j,\beta} $$ Whoa! What the heck is that!?
Well, that is my linear theory of battleship. What the equation is
trying to say is that I will try to predict the probability of a
particular ship being in a particular square by (1) noting the
background probability of that being true, and (2) adding up all of the
information I have, weighting it by the appropriate factor. So here, P
is our probability matrix, B is our background info matrix, I is our
information matrix, and W is our weight matrix, which is supposed to
apply the appropriate weights. That W guy seems like quite the monster.
It has four indexes! It does, so let's try to walk through what they all
mean. Here: $$ W_{i,\alpha,j,\beta} $$ is supposed to tell us: "the
extra probability of there being ship alpha at location i, given the
fact that we have the situation beta going on at location j" Read that
sentence a few times. I'm sorry its confusing, but it is the best way I
could come up with explaining W in english. Perhaps a visual would help.
Behold the following: (click to embiggen)</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3yG2fZ0Shbw/Tokz-Sj3NHI/AAAAAAAAAYM/dAwvv-d7Fy4/s1600/W1.png"><img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3yG2fZ0Shbw/Tokz-Sj3NHI/AAAAAAAAAYM/dAwvv-d7Fy4/s400/W1.png"></a></p>
<p>That is a picture of $$ W_{i,C,33,M} $$ that is, that is a picture of
the extra probabilities for each square (i is all of them), of there
being a carrier, (alpha=C) given that we got a miss (beta=M) on square
33, (j=33). You'll notice that the fact that we saw a miss affects some
of the squares nearby. In fact, knowing that there was a miss on square
33 means that the probability that the carrier will be found on the
adjacent squares is a little lower (notice on the scale that the nearby
values are negative), because there are now fewer ways the carrier could
be on those squares without it overlapping over into square 33. Let's
try another:</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QyHjW6mNlQY/Tokp1FryPpI/AAAAAAAAAYE/8hXRtZZblE0/s1600/W2.png"><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QyHjW6mNlQY/Tokp1FryPpI/AAAAAAAAAYE/8hXRtZZblE0/s400/W2.png"></a></p>
<p>That is a picture of $$ W_{i,S,65,H} $$ that is, it's showing the extra
probability of there being a submarine (alpha=S), at each square (i is
all of them, since its a picture with 100 squares), given that we
registered a hit (beta=H) on square 65 (j=65). Here you'll notice that
since we marked a hit on square 65, it is very likely that we will also
get hits on the squares just next to this one, as we could have
suspected. In the end, by assuming our theory has this linear form, the
benefit we gain is that by doing the same sort of simulations I did to
generate the background information, I can back out what the proper
values should be for this W matrix. By doing billions and billions of
simulations, I can ask, for any particular set of information, I, what
the probabilities are P, and solve for W. Given that the problem is
linear, this solving step is particularly easy for me to do.</p>
<h4>The Results</h4>
<p>In the end, this is exactly what I did. I had my computer create
billions of different battleship boards, and figure out what the proper
values of B and W should be for every square of the matrix. I put all of
those results together in a way that I hope is easy to explore up at the
<a href="http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~aalemi/battleship/">Fancy Battleship Results
Page</a>, where you
are free to explore all of the results yourself. In fact, the way it's
set up, you can even use the <a href="http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~aalemi/battleship/">Superduper Results
Page</a> as a sort of
Battleship Cheat Sheet. Have it open while you play a game of
battleship, and it will show you the probabilities associated with all
of the squares, helping you make your next guess. I've used the page
while playing a few games of battleship online, and have had some
success, winning 9 of the 10 games I played against the computer player.
Of course, this linear theory isn't everything...</p>
<h4>Why Linear isn't everything</h4>
<p>But at the end of the day, we've made a pretty glaring assumption about
the game of battleship, namely that all of the information on the board
adds in a linear way. Another way to say that is that in our theory of
battleship, we have a principle of superposition. Another way to say
that is that in this theory, what you think is happening in a particular
square is just the sum of the results from all of the squares,
independent of one another. Another way to say that is to show it with
another picture. Consider the following:</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZS2W4c9TfFc/Tok1UPt6OzI/AAAAAAAAAYk/Eia8LvwdAIU/s1600/nonlin.png"><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZS2W4c9TfFc/Tok1UPt6OzI/AAAAAAAAAYk/Eia8LvwdAIU/s400/nonlin.png"></a></p>
<p>Here, I've specified a bunch of misses, and am asking for the
probability of there being a Carrier on all of the positions of the
board. If you look in the center of that cluster of misses, especially
in the inner left of the bunch, you'll see that the linear theory tells
me that there is a small but finite chance that the Carrier is located
on those squares. But if you stop to look at the board a little bit,
you'll notice that I've arranged the misses such that there is a large
swatch of squares in the center of the cluster where the Carrier is
strictly forbidden. There is no way it can fit such that it touches a
lot of those central squares. This is an example of the failure of the
linear model. All the linear model knows is that in the spots nearby
misses there is a lower probability of the ship being there, but what it
doesn't know to do is look at the arrangement of misses and check to see
whether there is any possible way the ship can fit. This is a nonlinear
effect, involving information at more than one square at a time. It is
these kinds of effects that this theory will miss, but as you'll notice,
it still does pretty well. Even though it reports a finite positive
probability of the Carrier being inside the cluster, the value it
reports is a very small one, about 1 percent at most. So the linear
theory will have corrections at the 1 percent level or so, but that's
pretty good if you ask me.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>And so it is. I've tried to develop a linear theory for the game
Battleship, and display the results in a <a href="http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~aalemi/battleship/">Handy Dandy Data
Explorer</a>. I
encourage you to play around with the website, use it to win games of
Battleship, and in the comments, point out interesting effects, things
you think I've missed, or ideas for how to come up with linear theories
of other things.</p>

  Doc Brown didn't have a time-travel backup plan.</p>
<hr>
<p>In light of the incredible success of our last Physics Challenge Problem
(we received <em>several</em> responses), we here at the Virtuosi have decided
to reinstate what was nominally a "monthly" contest. In addition to a
brand-spankin'-new problem (with "prizes", see [1]), we have also tried
to make a nice collaborative environment for discussing interesting
physics problems and posting your own solutions. So I will discuss our
<a href="http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~aalemi/challenge/timemachine.php">new
problem</a>
and then I'll throw it over to Alemi to discuss the goal of our new
Physics Challenge webpage. Our last challenge problem
(<a href="http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~aalemi/challenge/archive.php">here</a>,
with winning solutions) was deemed a bit "unrealistic" by many because
it assumes that you were shipwrecked on a desert island <em>with a CRC
handbook!</em> What a ridiculous situation! Fear not, dear readers, we have
heard your complaints and have adjusted accordingly. Our new problem
relies on a far less ridiculous assumption. Assume you have created a
time machine out of a DeLorean [2]. You are sure it will send you back
in time and, causality-be-damned, you are ready to give it a test drive.
But you are less confident in the machine's ability to take you exactly
<em>when</em> you want. Additionally, the positive tachyonic chrono-coupler is
a bit finicky - meaning, of course, that there is a non-negligible
chance that once you go back in time, you may never be able to come
<em>Back to the Present</em>. Thus, there is a chance that your time machine
will have worked but no one will ever know! As an unabashed narcissist,
you find this totally unacceptable! But first and foremost, you are a
scientist. As a scientist, your challenge is to design a strategy that
would allow you to convince your present-day scientific peers that you
did travel back in the time even if you are stuck in the past. What
could you build/make/leave in the past that would be most likely to
convince modern scientists that it <em>had</em> to be from a time-traveler and
not just some hoaxer? How long would your strategy be effective? Would
it work if you were stuck ten thousand years in the past? What about a
million years in the past? What about 100 million? Though this is an
inherently silly problem, we feel that the idea behind it is a very
interesting one. What could one motivated person do/build/make that
would survive a long time into the future? Also, the winning solution
will be submitted as a policy White Paper for all future time-travelers.
So that's the new problem. You can find the "official" posting
<a href="http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~aalemi/challenge/timemachine.php">here</a>.
I now cede the floor and my remaining time to the gentleman from
Wisconsin.</p>
<h5>A sense of community...</h5>
<p>So, we've had this blog going for a while now, and we get a decent
number of comments on our posts, but felt as though something has been
lacking. A certain sense of community. Over the past year, we've done
some neat things here, and now it's your turn. Step right up, because
we've just launched a google groups:
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/thevirtuosi">TheVirtuosi</a> where
we hope people from all corners of the globe will gather to discuss
their kooky physics projects. Have you recently explored the physics of
cats? Launch a discussion. Do you have an idea but need some help
investigating it? Create a discussion and query us and all of our
fantastic readers. Have an idea for a blog post you want to see? Let us
know. Want to take a stab at solving one of the newly minted <a href="http://bit.ly/physicschallenge">Physics
Challenge</a> problems in public? Go for
it! I know the site is sparse now, but we'd really like to build a
little bit of a community here, so please, post away. You all have
already bookmarked it I'm sure, but a permanent link has been added to
the top of the sidebar as well. That is all. [1] These "prizes" will no
longer be as exciting as the CRC from last time, for several reasons.
First of all, we are all poor grad students and have no money. Secondly,
the winners from last time lived as far away from us as physically
possible and it's expensive to ship heavy things. So what can you expect
to win? Well, you could win a "certificate of accomplishment" which
would just be drawn in crayon by one of this. But it will be made with
love! Or you could win a floppy disk with a recording of my very own
version of the Jurassic Park theme. The surprise is part of the fun (I'm
told). [2] Quoth the most famous chrononaut of our time, Dr. Emmett
Brown: "The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a
car, why not do it with some style?"</p>

<p>So, I recently read <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=fXxde44_0zsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=An+Introduction+to+Information+Theory&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7opdTrjhMMXrOarHmdIC&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">An Introduction to Information Theory: Symbols,
Signals and
Noise</a>.
It is a very nice popular introduction to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Theory">Information
Theory</a>, a modern
scientific pursuit to quantify information started by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon">Claude
Shannon</a> in 1948. This got
me thinking. Increasingly, people try to hold conversations on
<a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, where posts are limited to 140
characters. Just how much information could you convey in 140
characters? After some coding and investigation, I created
<a href="http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~aalemi/twitter/">this</a>, an
experimental twitter English compression algorithm capable of
compressing around 140 words into 140 characters. So, what's the story?
Warning: It's a bit of a story, the juicy bits are at the end. UPDATE:
Tomo in the comments below made <a href="http://www.saigonist.com/b/twitter-decoder-ring">a chrome
extension</a> for the
algorithm</p>
<h4>Entropy</h4>
<p>Ultimately, we need some way to assess how much information is contained
in a signal. What does it mean for a signal to contain information
anyway? Is 'this is a test of twitter compression.' more meaningful than
'歒堙丁顜善咮旮呂'? The first is understandable by any english speaker,
and requires 38 characters. You might think the second is meaningful to
a speaker of chinese, but I'm fairly certain it is gibberish, and takes
8 characters. But, the thing is if you put those 8 characters into <a href="http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~aalemi/twitter/">the
bottom form here</a>,
you'll recover the first. So, in some sense to the messages are
equivalent. They contain the same amount of information. Shannon tried
to quantify how we could estimate just how much information any message
contains. Of course it would be very hard to try to track down every
intelligent being in the universe and ask them if any particular message
had any meaning to them. Instead, Shannon reserved himself to trying to
quantify how much information was contained in a message produced by a
random source. In this regard, the question of how much information a
message contains becomes a more tractable question: How unlike is a
particular message from all other messages produced by the same random
source? This question might sound a little familiar. It is similar to a
question that comes up a lot in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_physics">Statistical
Physics</a>, where we are
interested in just how unlike a particular configuration of a system is
from all possible configurations of a system. In Statistical physics,
the quantity that helps us answer questions like this is the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy">Entropy</a>, where the entropy is
defined as $$ S = -\sum_i p_i \log p_i $$ where p_i stands for the
probability of a particular configuration, and we are supposed to sum
over all possible configurations of the system. Similarly, for our
random message source, we can define the entropy in exactly the same
way, but for convenience, let's replace the logarithm with the logarithm
base 2. $$ S = -\sum_i p_i \log_2 p_i $$ At this point, the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_entropy">Shannon Entropy, or Information
Entropy</a> takes on a real
quantitative meaning. It reflects how many bits of information the
message source produces per character. The result of all of this aligns
quite well with intuition. If we have a source that outputs two symbols
0 or 1 randomly, each with probability 1/2. The shannon entropy comes
out to be 1, meaning each of the symbols of our source is worth one bit,
which we already new. If instead of two symbols, our source can output
16 symbols, 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F say, the shannon entropy
comes out to be 4 bits per symbol, which again we should have suspected
since with four bits we can count up to the number 16 in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_numeral_system">base
2</a> (e.g. 0000 - 0,
0001 - 1, 0010 - 2 , etc ). Where it begins to get interesting is when
all of our symbols don't occur with equal probability. To get a sense of
this situation, I'll show 5 example outputs:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>'000001000100000000010000010000'

'000000000010000000000001000000'

'010100000000000000000000111000'

'010100000000000000000000111000'

'000000000100000000110000000010'
</pre>


<p>looking at these examples, it begins to become clear that since we have
a lot more zeros than ones, each of these messages contain less
information than the case when 0 and 1 occur with equal probability. In
fact, in this case, if 0 occurs 90% of the time, and 1 occurs 10% of the
time, the shannon entropy comes out to be 0.47. Meaning each symbol is
worth just less than half a bit. We should expect our messages in this
case to have to be about twice as long to encode the same amount of
information. In an extreme example, imagine you were trying to transmit
a message to someone in binary, but for some reason, your device had a
sticky 0 key so that every time you pushed 0, it transmitted 0 10 times
in a row. It should be clear in this case that as far as the receiver is
concerned, this is not a very efficient transmission scheme.</p>
<h4>English</h4>
<p>What does this have to do with anything? Well, all of that and I really
only wanted to build up a fact you already know. The fact is, the
English language is not very efficient on a per symbol basis. For
example, I'm sure everyone knows exactly what word will come at the end
of this <strong><em>_</em></strong>. There you go, I was able to express exactly the
same thought with at least 8 fewer characters. n fct, w cn d _ lt bttr
[in fact, we can do a lot better], using 22 characters to express a
thought that normally takes 31 characters. In fact, Shannon has a <a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Shannon1950.pdf">nice
paper</a> where he
attempted to measure the entropy of the english language itself. Using
more sophisticated methods, he concludes that english has an information
entropy of between 0.6 and 1.3 bits per character, let's call it 1 bit
per character. Whereas, if each of the 27 symbols (26 letters + space)
we commonly use each showed up equally frequently, we would have 4.75
bits per character possible. Of course, from a practical communication
standpoint, having redundancies in human language can be a useful thing,
as it allows us to still understand one another even over noisy phone
lines and with very bad handwriting. But, with modern computers and
faithful transmission of information, we really ought to be able to do
better.</p>
<h4>Twitter</h4>
<p>This brings me back to <a href="http://twitter.com/">twitter</a>. If you are
unaware, twitter allows users to post short, 140 character messages for
the rest of the world to enjoy. 140 characters is not a lot to go on.
Assuming 4.5 characters per word, this means that in traditionally
written english you're lucky to fit 25 words in a standard tweet. But,
we know now that we can do better. In fact, if we could come up with
some kind of crazy scheme to compress english in such a way as to use
each of the 27 usual characters so that each of those characters
appeared with roughly equal probability, we've seen that we could get
4.75 bits per character, with 140 characters and 5.5 symbols per word,
this would allow us to fit not 25 words in a tweet but 120 words. A
factor of 4.8 improvement. Of course we would have to discover this
miraculous encryption transformation. Which to my knowledge remains
undiscovered. But, we can do better. It turns out that twitter allows
you to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</a> characters in
your tweets. Beyond enabling you to talk about Lagrangians (ℒ) and play
cards (♣), it enables international communication, by including foreign
alphabets. So, in fact we don't need to limit ourselves to the 27
commonly used English symbols. We could use a much larger alphabet,
Chinese say. I choose Chinese because there are over 20,900 Chinese
alphabet symbols in Unicode. Using all of these characters, we could
theoretically encode 14.3 bits of information per character, with 140
characters, and 1 bit per English character, and 5.5 symbols per English
word, we could theoretically fit over 365 English words in a single
tweet. But alas, we would have to discover some magical encoding
algorithm that could map typed English to the Chinese alphabet such that
each of the Chinese symbols occurred with equal probability. I wasn't
able to do that well, but I did make an attempt.</p>
<h4>My Attempt</h4>
<p>So, I tried to compress the English language, an design an effective
mapping from written English to the Chinese character set of Unicode. We
know that we aim to have each of these Chinese characters occur with
equal probability, so my algorithm was quite simple. Let's just look at
a bunch of English and see which pair of characters occur with the
highest probability, and map these to the first Chinese character in the
Unicode set. Replace their occurring in the text, rinse, and repeat.
This technique is guaranteed to reduce the probability at which the most
common character occurs at every step, by taking some if its occurrences
and replacing them, so it at least aims to achieve our ultimate goal.
That's it. Of course, I tried to bootstrap the algorithm a little bit by
first mapping the most common 1500 words to their own symbols. For
example, consider the first stanza of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_raven">Raven by Edger Allen
Poe</a></p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,

Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore--

While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,

As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.

"'Tis some visiter," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door--

                     Only this and nothing more."
</pre>


<p>The most common character is ' ' (the space). The most common pair is 'e
' (e followed by space), so let's replace 'e ' with the first Chinese
Unicode character '一' we obtain:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>Onc一upon a midnight dreary, whil一I pondered, weak and weary,

Over many a quaint and curious volum一of forgotten lore--

Whil一I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly ther一cam一a tapping,

"'Tis som一visiter," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door--

                     Only this and nothing more.'
</pre>


<p>So we've reduced the number of spaces a bit. Doing one more step, now
the most common pair of characters is 'in', which we replace by '丁'
obtaining:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>Onc一upon a midnight dreary, whil一I pondered, weak and weary,

Over many a qua丁t and curious volum一of forgotten lore--

Whil一I nodded, nearly napp丁g, suddenly ther一cam一a tapp丁g,

"'Tis som一visiter," I muttered, "tapp丁g at my chamber door--

                     Only this and noth丁g more.'
</pre>


<p>etc. The end results of the effort are <a href="http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~aalemi/twitter/">demo-ed
here</a>. Feel free to
play around with it. For the most part, typing some standard English, I
seem to be able to get compression ratios around 5 or so. Let me know
how it does for you. I'll leave you with this final message:</p>

  The rotting corpses of sunbeams cause global warming.</p>
<hr>
<p>Good news, everyone! While rummaging through all my old stuff at home, I
found my long-lost copy of <em>Toto IV</em>. Huzzah for me! This is entirely
unrelated to what I wanted to talk about, but I have it on good
authority that Toto's
<em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azVqekQBK8g">Africa</a></em> syncs up <em>really</em>
well with this post [1]. I'll tell you when to press play. Anyway, what
I really wanted to talk about was a fairly well-posed problem in
<em>Futurama.</em> In the episode "Crimes of the Hot," all of the Earth's
robots vent their various "exhausts" into the sky at the same time,
using the thrust to push the Earth into an orbit slightly further away
from the sun. As a result of this new orbit, the year is made longer by
"exactly one week." Anything that quantitative is pretty much asking to
be analyzed. Let's explore this problem a bit more then, why not? [
<em>Those wishing to get the full aural experience of this post should
press</em>play <em>on their cassette players ... now ]</em> <em><em> First, a little
background. In this episode, it is learned that all the robots
(especially Hedonism Bot) emit the greenhouse gases responsible for
Global Warming. The previous solution (detailed
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2taViFH_6_Y">here</a>) is no longer viable,
so it is decided that all robots must be destroyed (especially Hedonism
Bot). The disembodied head of Richard Nixon rounds up all the world's
robots on the Galapagos [2] to have a "party" so that they may be
destroyed by a giant space-based electromagnetic pulse cannon. In a
last-ditch effort to save the robots, Professor Farnsworth has all the
robots blast their exhausts into the sky, using the thrust to push the
Earth into an orbit further away from the sun, thus solving the problem
of global warming once and for all. As a result of changing the Earth's
orbit, the year is "exactly one week longer." First Pass Through Ok, so
what can we say about the new orbit if all we know is that its orbital
period is exactly one week longer? Well, we know from our good buddy
Kepler that the square of the period of a bound orbit is proportional to
the cube of its semi-major axis [3], so $$\tau^2 \propto a^3.$$ We
already know the Earth's period (1 year) and semi-major axis (1
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit">AU</a>) before the
robo-boost, so we can get rid of the proportionality by writing things
in terms of the initial values. In other words, $$
\left(\frac{\tau}{1\~\mbox{yr}}\right)^2=\left(\frac{a}{1\~\mbox{AU}}\right)^3.$$
Alright, so we know that our new orbital period is 1 year + 1 week, or
since there are 52 weeks in a year, 53/52 years. So our new semi-major
axis is $$ a = \left(\frac{1 +
1/52\~\mbox{yr}}{1\~\mbox{yr}}\right)^{2/3}\mbox{AU}\approx1.013\~\mbox{AU},$$
or a little over 1% larger than it is currently. Fair enough. So would
this fix Global Warming for ever and ever? Let's see. The solar flux at
some distance d is given by $$ S = \frac{L_{\odot}}{4\pi d^2}, $$
where L is the luminosity of the sun. So the ratio of the flux at the
new semi-major axis [4] to that before the orbit was changed is $$
\frac{S}{S_0}=\left(\frac{a_0}{a}\right)^2=\left(\frac{a}{1\~\mbox{yr}}\right)^{-2}.$$
OK, so we have the flux, but how do we relate this to temperature? Well,
we know that the power radiated by a blackbody of temperature T is given
by $$ P = \sigma A T^4, $$ where sigma is the Stefan-Boltzmann
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law">constant</a>, A
is the area of the emitting region and T is the temperature. For a
blackbody in equilibrium, the power coming in is going to be equal to
the power going out. The power coming in is just the solar flux times
the cross-section area of Earth, given by $$ P_{in} = S\times\pi
R^2_{\oplus} $$ and the power going out is just that radiated by the
Earth as a blackbody $$ P_{out} =\sigma \times 4\pi
R^2_{\oplus}\times T^4. $$ Equating the power in to the power out
gives $$ T = \left( \frac{S}{4\sigma}\right)^{1/4}. $$ Now we can
find the ratio of the new average Earth temperature to the temperature
before the orbital move. We have $$ \frac{T}{T_0} =\left(
\frac{S}{S_0}\right)^{1/4}=\left(
\frac{a_0}{a}\right)^{1/2}\approx0.994$$ If we take the initial
average Earth temperature to be something like T = 300 K, then we find a
new temperature of T = 298 K. Huzzah, a whole 2 degrees cooler! That may
not sound like a lot, but remember, that's the mean global temperature.
Apparently, it only takes a few degrees increase in global average
temperatures to make things a bit uncomfortable for people. The IPCC
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming">indicates</a> that the
average global surface temperature on Earth in the next century is
likely to rise by about 1 to 2 degrees under optimistic scenarios or
about 3 to 6 degrees under pessimistic scenarios. So the robo-boost
option is at least in the right ballpark here. Neat! How Big Is The
Push? So how big of a push did the robots need to give the Earth to
boost it out to this new orbit? Is this possible? Let's find out! First
we need to find out how the Earth's velocity has changed. We can do this
by finding the change in energy. The total energy of a bound orbit is
given by $$ E = -\frac{k}{2a}$$ where </em>a</em> is the semi-major axis of the
orbit and <em>k</em>= <em>GMm</em>. So the difference in Earth's energy before and
after the robo-boost is $$ E_f - E_0
=-\frac{k}{2a_f}-\left(-\frac{k}{2a_0}\right)=\frac{k}{2a_0}\left(1-\frac{a_0}{a_f}\right).$$
But we also know that Earth's energy in the orbit is given by $$ E =
-\frac{k}{r} + \frac{1}{2}mv^2, $$ so the difference in energy before
and after is $$ E_f - E_0
=\frac{1}{2}m\left(v^2_f-v^2_0\right), $$ where we have found the
energies immediately before and immediately after the boost so Earth is
pretty much at the same distance from the sun, so the potential energy
terms cancel. Combining our expressions for the change in energy and
solving for the final velocity, we find $$ v_f =
\left[\frac{GM_{\odot}}{a_0}\left(1-\frac{a_0}{a_f}\right)+v^2_0\right]^{1/2}.$$
Taking the initial orbital velocity of the Earth to be 30 km/s, we find
that the final velocity of the Earth immediately after the robo-boost is
$$ v_f = 30.2\~\mbox{km/s}$$ So the robots just need to give a
"little" 200 m/s boost to the Earth, right? Well, we are adding velocity
vectors here, so it depends on which direction the robots are pushing.
The magnitude of the final velocity is given by $$v_f =
\sqrt{\left({\bf v_0}+{\bf \Delta v}
\right)^2}=\sqrt{v^2_0+\Delta v^2-2v_0\Delta v
\cos{\beta}},$$ where delta v is the boost in velocity caused by the
robots and beta is the angle between the initial orbital motion of the
Earth and the velocity boost from the robots. If they wanted to make it
slightly easier on themselves, the robots would have boosted the Earth
in the direction it was already moving. That would make the cosine beta
term equal to one and thus minimize the necessary boost. However, in the
show the robots appear to point their exhaust right at the sun (see
figure below). This is essentially at a 90 degree angle to the Earth's
orbital motion, so the cosine beta term goes to zero in our expression
above. Plugging it all in we find that the magnitude of the robo-boost
is $$\Delta v \approx 3.5\~\mbox{km/s}.$$ We see that this is a fair
bit larger than the 0.2 km/s needed for a boost parallel to Earth's
initial velocity.</p>

  Robots blasting from the Galapagos (which now appear to be in China...)</p>
<hr>
<p>Alright, so how much effort would it take to give that kind of boost to
the Earth? We can quantify this effort in terms of a force or in terms
of the energy difference. Let's do both. For the force, we have $$ F =
\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}=\frac{M_{\oplus}\Delta v}{\Delta t}.$$
Here we are a little stuck unless we can figure out the duration of the
robo-boost. Watching the episode again, the robots are blasting up
exhaust for about a minute but then the show cuts to commercial. So we
don't really know how long they were pushing. Let's just say an hour,
but we'll leave the time in if we want to fiddle with that. Plugging in
numbers, the total force is $$ F =
6\times10^{24}\~\mbox{N}\left(\frac{\Delta
t}{1\~\mbox{hr}}\right)^{-1}.$$ If this force is spread evenly over
the billion robots present [5], then each robot would be applying a
force of $$ F = 6\times10^{15}\~\mbox{N},$$ which is roughly
equivalent to the force it would take to lift up Mount Everest [6]. That
wasn't terribly helpful. Let's look at the work then instead. The total
work done by the robots to move the Earth is $$ W =
\frac{1}{2}M_{\oplus}\left(v^2_f - v^2_0\right) \approx
4\times10^{31}\~\mbox{J}.$$ Well, that's a large number. Could a
billion robots feasibly do that much work? If the robots are each 100
kg, then if the mass of all billion robots were directly converted to
energy, we would get $$ E = mc^2 =
10^9\times10^2\~\mbox{kg}\times\left(3\times10^8\~\mbox{m/s}\right)^2
\approx 10^{28}\~\mbox{J},$$ or less than a thousandth the total
energy needed. So it looks unlikely that the robots would be able to
push the Earth, but that was to be expected. Changes to The Orbit
Let's take a look at how the robo-boost affects the entirety of the
Earth's new orbit. In our first pass through the problem, we ignored the
fact that the shape of the orbit changed and only focused on the new
semi-major axis. To see why we must also consider the changes to the
"shape" of the orbit, take a look at the figure below.
<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3tRZVuztuF0/TlGMMLhegtI/AAAAAAAAAOo/3jzGbWvvM90/s1600/orbits.png"><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3tRZVuztuF0/TlGMMLhegtI/AAAAAAAAAOo/3jzGbWvvM90/s400/orbits.png"></a>
In the figure, the initial orbit is plotted (black dashed line) as well
as two new orbits that each have the appropriate semi-major axis so that
the period of revolution is one year and one week. The difference
between the two final orbits comes from the robots pushing in different
directions. In the blue orbit, the boost was made in a direction
radially outward from the Sun (that is, perpendicular to the orbital
velocity of the Earth). This is the case shown in the <em>Futurama</em>episode.
In the red orbit, the boost was made parallel to the orbital velocity of
the Earth. In each case, the boost was applied at the point labeled with
an "X." One thing that jumps out from this figure is that the Earth is
always further away from the sun on the red orbit than it was on the
initial (dashed black) orbit. But on the blue orbit, the Earth is
further away from the Sun than it was initially for only half the orbit.
On the other half, the blue orbit would actually make the Earth's
temperature <em>higher</em> than it was on the old orbit! The temperature
calculation we made earlier should hold pretty well for the red orbit,
since it is essentially a circle. It would be a little more tricky for
the blue orbit, as one would need to get a time-averaged value of the
flux over the course of the whole orbit. A hundred Quatloos to anyone
that does the calculation. Wrap-Up So what have we found out here? Well,
it seems that there are certain scenarios in which boosting the Earth
out to a new orbit with period of 1 year + 1 week could cool the Earth
by a few degrees. Granted, we have made some simplifications (the Earth
is not a blackbody), but the general idea of the thing should still
hold. I had some fun playing around with this problem and I thought it
was neat that there was a good deal of information to get started with
from the episode. The <em>Futurama</em> people gave an exact period and at
least a visual representation of the direction the robots apply their
push. So 600 Quatloos for the writers! Not Quite As Useless as Usual
Footnotes [1] At least I think it says so if you play this
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUjIA3Rt7gk">song</a> backwards. [2]
According to the Wikipedia page for the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_of_the_Hot#Production">episode</a>,
the location of the Galapagos for the party was chosen because the
writers felt that it would be most convenient to push the Earth near the
equator. [3] The semi-major axis of an ellipse is half of the longest
line cutting through the center of the ellipse. Likewise, the semi-minor
axis is half of the shortest line drawn through the center of the
ellipse. Check <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Ellipse.html">this</a> out for
some more fun stuff on ellipses. [4] This is technically incorrect,
since the semi-major axis is measured from the center of the ellipse,
but the sun is located on one of the foci. However, this requires
information on the eccentricity of the orbit, which we are currently
glossing over right now. Our method is then approximate, but becomes
exact in the case where both orbits are circles. The effect, however, is
minor. At worst, it is semi-minor. Zing! [5] My source for this billion
robots number comes from Professor Farnsworth himself. When it looks
like the robots will all be destroyed the Professor says "A billion
robot lives are about to be extinguished. Oh, the Jedis are going to
feel this one!" [6] Well, sort of. The height of Everest is \~10^4 m,
so this gives a volume of \~10^12 m^3. The density of most metals is
around \~10 g/cm^3, which is \~10^4 kg/m^3. This gives a mass of
\~10^16 kg. The weight is then \~10^17 N. Each robot exerts a force of
\~10^16 N. So not quite, but hey it was the first thing I thought of
and it almost worked out so I'm sticking with it!</p>

The iPhone 3GS has a built-in <a href="http://pdf1.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-pdf/view/236640/STMICROELECTRONICS/LIS302DL.html">accelerometer, the
LIS302DL</a>,
which is primarily used for detecting device orientation. I wanted to
come up with something interesting to do with it, but first I had to see
how it did on some basic tests. It turns out that the tests gave really
interesting results themselves! A drop test gave clean results and a
spring test gave fantastic data; however a pendulum test gave some
problems. You might guess the accelerometer would give a reading of 0 in
all axes when the device is sitting on a desk. However, this
accelerometer measures "proper acceleration," which essentially is a
measure of acceleration relative to free-fall. So the device will read
-1 in the z direction (in units where 1 corresponds to 9.8 m/s^2, the
acceleration due to gravity at the surface of Earth). Armed with this
knowledge, let's take a look at the drop test: To perform this test, I
stood on the couch which was in my office (before it was taken away from
us!), and dropped my phone hopefully into the hands of my officemate. I
suspected that the device would read magnitude 1 before dropping, 0
during the drop, and a large spike for the large deceleration when the
phone was caught.
<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-g8pt_dT0gR8/Tj9D2GTkc6I/AAAAAAAAADw/1iwHCsPixtY/s1600/DropTest.png"><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-g8pt_dT0gR8/Tj9D2GTkc6I/AAAAAAAAADw/1iwHCsPixtY/s400/DropTest.png"></a>
As you can see, the results were basically as expected. The purple line
shows the magnitude of the acceleration relative to free-fall. Before
the drop, the magnitude bounces around 1, which is due to my inability
to hold something steadily. The drop occurred near time 12.6, but I
wasn't able to move my hand arbitrarily quickly so there's not a sharp
drop to 0 magnitude. The phone fell for around 0.4 seconds corresponding
to $$y = \frac{1}{2} g t^2 = \frac{1}{2} (9.8 \frac{m}{s^2})<em>(0.4
s)^2 = 0.784 m = 2.57 feet $$ As for the spike at 13 seconds, the raw
data shows that the catch occurs in $$ t = 0.02 \pm 0.01 s $$. In order
for the device to come to rest in such a short amount of time, there
needs to be a large deceleration provided by my officemate's hands. Now
the pendulum test consisted of taping my phone to the bottom of a 20
foot pendulum.
<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7uO_824O6t4/Tj9Q1crvlUI/AAAAAAAAAD4/uO3YsrXStak/s1600/pendulum.png"><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7uO_824O6t4/Tj9Q1crvlUI/AAAAAAAAAD4/uO3YsrXStak/s400/pendulum.png"></a>
I didn't think enough about this, but the period of a pendulum, assuming
we have a small amplitude, is given by: $$T = 2 \pi
\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$$ which is about 5 seconds. With a relatively small
amplitude, the acceleration in the x direction will be small. Basically
I'm reaching the limit of the resolution of the acceleration device. It
appears that the smallest increment the device can measure is 0.0178 g.
This happens to match the specifications from the spec sheet I linked at
the top of the page, where they specify a minimum of 0.0162 g, and a
typical sensitivity of 0.018 g! Now we come to the most exciting test,
the spring test! Setup: I taped my phone to the end of a spring and let
it go. Ok. Here is the actual acceleration data:
<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3qbU9p2I3sE/Tj9a7-eOk-I/AAAAAAAAAEA/0ByUQ039dio/s1600/springdata.png"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3qbU9p2I3sE/Tj9a7-eOk-I/AAAAAAAAAEA/0ByUQ039dio/s400/springdata.png"></a>
The first thing I see is that the oscillation frequency looks constant,
as it should be for a simple harmonic oscillator. There is also a decay
which looks exponential! Let's see how well the data fits if we have a
frictional term proportional to the velocity of the phone. This gives is
a differential equation which looks like this: $$ m \ddot{x} +
F\dot{x} + k x = 0 $$ Now we can plug in an ansatz (educated guess) to
solve this equation: $$ x(t) = A</em>e^{i b t} $$ $$-b^2 mx(t) + i b
Fx(t) + kx(t) = 0$$ $$-m b^2+iFb+k = 0$$ We can solve this equation for
b with the quadratic equation: $$ b = \frac{\sqrt{4km - F^2}}{2m} +
i\frac{F}{2m} \equiv \omega + i \gamma $$ where I defined two new
constants here. So we see that our ansatz does solve the differential
equation. Now we want acceleration, which is the second time derivative
of position with respect to time. $$a(t) \equiv \ddot{x} = -b^2 A
e^{ibt} $$ Now are only interested in the real part of this solution,
which gives us (adding in a couple of constants to make the solution
more general): $$a(t) = -(\omega^2 - \gamma^2) A e^{-\gamma t}
cos(\omega t + \phi) + C $$ Let's redefine the coefficient of this
acceleration to make things a little cleaner! $$a(t) = B e^{-\gamma t}
cos(\omega t + \phi) + C $$ Ok, with that math out of the way (for
now), we can try to fit this data. I actually used Excel to fit this
data using a not-so-well-known tool called Solver. This allows you to
maximize or minimize one cell while Excel varies other cells. In this
case, I defined a cell which is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_sum_of_squares">Residual Sum of
Squares</a> of my fit
versus the actual data, and I tell Excel to vary the 5 constants which
make the fit! The values jump around for a little while then it gives up
when it thinks it converged to a solution. Using this you can fit
arbitrary functions, neato! With this, I come up with the following
plot:
<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-23lXSPVOwuY/Tj9a8Curm3I/AAAAAAAAAEI/F5Fb9dxdvDs/s1600/springlineardamp.png"><img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-23lXSPVOwuY/Tj9a8Curm3I/AAAAAAAAAEI/F5Fb9dxdvDs/s400/springlineardamp.png"></a>
$$B = 0.633740943$$ $$\gamma = 0.012097581 $$ $$\omega = 8.599670376
$$ $$\phi = 0.693075811 $$ $$C =-1.004454967 $$ with an R^2 value of
0.968! At this point it should be noted that if I discretize my smooth
fit to have the same resolution (0.0178 g) as the accelerometer, then
see what the error is comparing the smooth fit to its own
discretization, I get an R^2 of 0.967! This means that there is a
decent amount of built-in error to these fits due to discretization on
the order of the error we're seeing for our actual fits. Immediately we
can recognize that C should be -1, since this is just a factor relating
"free-fall" acceleration to actual iPhone acceleration. If we wanted, we
could solve for the ratio of the spring constant to the mass, but I'll
leave that as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Classical-Electrodynamics-Third-David-Jackson/dp/047130932X">an exercise for the
reader.</a>
If you look closely, you can see that the frequency appears to match
very well. The two lines don't go out of phase. One problem with the fit
is the decay. The beginning and the end of the data are too high
compared to the fit, which is a problem. This implies that there is some
other kind of friction at work. Some larger objects or faster moving
objects tend to experience a frictional force proportional to the square
of the velocity. I don't think my iPhone is large or fast (compared to a
plane for example), but I'll try it anyway. The differential equation
is: $$ m \ddot{x} + F\dot{x}^2 + k x = 0 $$ yikes. This is a tough
one because of the velocity squared term. <a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/3620747">One trick I found
here</a> attempts a general solution for
a similar equation. They make an approximation in order to solve it, but
the approximation is pretty good in our case. Take a look at the paper
if you're interested. The basic idea is to note that the friction term
is the only one that affects the energy. So, assuming that the energy
losses are small in a cycle, we can look at a small change in energy
with respect to a small change in time due to this force term. This
gives us an equation which can let us solve for the amplitude as a
function of time approximately! Really interesting idea. So I plugged
the following equation into the Excel Solver: $$a(t) = \frac{A
cos(\omega t + \phi)}{\gamma t + 1} + B$$ Here's the fit:
<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fCXr2CkPGE4/Tj9a8pH2KFI/AAAAAAAAAEQ/XaulleF3xK4/s1600/springsqdamp.png"><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fCXr2CkPGE4/Tj9a8pH2KFI/AAAAAAAAAEQ/XaulleF3xK4/s400/springsqdamp.png"></a>
Which uses these values: $$A = 0.772773705 $$ $$\gamma = 0.029745368 $$
$$\omega = 8.600177692 $$ $$\phi = 0.688610161 $$ $$B = -1.004530009
$$ with an R^2 value of 0.964! This fit seems to have the opposite
effect. The middle of the data is too high compared to the fit, while
the beginning and end of the data seems too low. This makes me think
that the actual friction terms involved in this problem are possibly a
sum of a linear term and a squared term. I don't know how to make
progress on that differential equation, so I wasn't able to fit
anything. If you try the same trick I mentioned earlier, you run into a
problem where you can't separate some variables which you need to
separate in the derivation unfortunately. So there you have it, I wanted
to find something neat to do, and I got really cool data from just
testing the accelerometer. Stay tuned for an interesting challenge
involving some physical data from my accelerometer!</p>

has greatly influenced the progress of most sports. There have been
continual improvements in equipment for safety or performance as well as
improvements in technique. I'd like to talk about some physics in sports
over a series of posts. Here I'll talk about a technique improvement in
High Jumping, the Fosbury Flop. The Fosbury Flop came into the High
Jumping scene in the 1968 Olympics, where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Fosbury">Dick
Fosbury</a> used the technique
to win the gold medal. The biggest difference between the Flop and
previous methods is that the jumper goes over the bar upside down
(facing the sky). This allows the jumper to bend their back so that
their arms and legs drape below the bar which lowers the center of mass
(See the picture above). Here is a video of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bgVgFwoQVE">Fosbury
Flop</a> executed very well.
<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UYbUVO1G8JM/TjYpGgCGOxI/AAAAAAAAADQ/wKjdCsuwLB0/s1600/flopdiagram.jpg"><img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UYbUVO1G8JM/TjYpGgCGOxI/AAAAAAAAADQ/wKjdCsuwLB0/s320/flopdiagram.jpg"></a>Let’s
assume Dick Fosbury is shaped like a semi-circle as he moves over the
bar. The bar is indicated as a red circle, as this is a side view. From
this diagram, we can guess his center of mass is probably near the
marked 'x', since most of his mass is below the bar. It is important to
recall the definition of center of mass, which is the average location
of all of the mass in an object. $$ \vec{R} = \frac{1}{M} \int
\vec{r} dm $$ Note that this is a vector equation, and the integral
should be over all of the mass elements. This integral gets easier
because I'm going to assume that Dick Fosbury is a constant density
semi-circle. This means that $$ M = C<em>h $$ where C is a constant equal
to the ratio of the mass to the height, and $$dm = C * dh $$. This is a
vector equation, so in principle we need to solve the x integral and the
y integral; however, due to the symmetry about the y-axis, the x
integral is zero. Finally we'll convert to polar coordinates, leaving us
with: $$ y = \frac{1}{C \pi R} \int_0^\pi R\sin{\theta} C R
d\theta = \frac{1}{C \pi R} R (-\cos{\theta}) C R \bigg|_0^\pi
= \frac{2R}{\pi} $$ Ok, so this is the y-coordinate of the center of
mass of our jumper relative to the bottom of the semi-circle. Now we
need to calculate relative to the top of the bar, which is roughly the
location of the top of the circle. We just need to subtract from R: $$ R
- \frac{2}{\pi} R = R * (1 - \frac{2}{\pi}) = \frac{h}{\pi} * (1
- \frac{2}{\pi}) $$ Now Dick Fosbury was 1.95m tall, which gives us a
distance of 22.6 cm BELOW the bar! Of course he's not a semi-circle, but
this isn't a terrible approximation, as you can see from the video
linked above. Further, wikipedia mentions that some proficient jumpers
can get their center of mass 20 cm below the bar, which matches pretty
well with our guess. A nifty technique in physics is looking at the
point-particle system, which allows us to see the underlying motion of a
system. If you’re not familiar with this method, you collect any given
number of objects and replace them with a single point at the center of
mass of the object. We can use energy conservation now for our
point-mass instead of the entire body of the jumper.<a href="posts/old/physics-in-sports-the-fosbury-flop/#note1">^note^</a> In
this case, we can simply deal with the center of mass motion of the
jumper. All of my kinetic energy will be converted to gravitational
potential energy. Again this is an approximation because some energy is
spent on forward motion, as well as the slight twisting motion which
I'll ignore. $$E = \frac{1}{2} mv^2 = mgh$$ Now let’s look at some
data. Here is a plot of each world record in the high jump.
<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DVfHxJG5b-U/TjY-0WQ1YkI/AAAAAAAAADg/GDFfNr0KiBo/s1600/worldrecords.png"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DVfHxJG5b-U/TjY-0WQ1YkI/AAAAAAAAADg/GDFfNr0KiBo/s400/worldrecords.png"></a>The
blue data show jumps before the Flop, and the red data show records
after the Flop. <strong>Note: In 1978, the straddle technique broke the
world record, being the only non-flop technique to do so since 1968.
Thanks Janne!</strong> The Flop was revealed in 1968, so I’ll assume that all
jumps before this year used a method where the center of mass of the
jumper was roughly even with the bar, while all jumps after this year
used the flop (see the previous note). Clearly something happened just
before the Flop came out, and this is something called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straddle_technique">the Straddle
technique</a>. I want to
know the percent difference in the initial energies required, so I will
calculate $$ 100\% * \frac{E_0-E_f}{E_0} = 100\% </em>
\frac{mgh_0-mgh_f}{mgh_0} = 100\% * \frac{h_0-h_f}{h_0} $$
where $$E_0$$ is the initial energy without the force, err the flop,
and $$ E_f $$ is the initial energy using the flop. Since we are using
the point-particle system, the gravitational potential energy only cares
about the center of mass of the flopper, and we need to know the height
of the center of mass for a 2.45m flop, which is the current world
record. This corresponds to a flop center of mass height of 2.25m, which
gives us an 8.2% decrease in energy using the flop (versus a method
where the center of mass is even with the bar)! The current world record
is roughly 20 cm higher than it was when the flop came out. This could
be due to athletes getting stronger, but this physics tells us that some
of the height increase could have been from the technique change. To sum
up, the high jump competition, along with many other sports, is being
exploited by physics! [note] Here we're relying on the center of mass
being equal to something called the center of gravity of the jumper. The
center of mass is as defined above. The center of gravity is the average
location of the gravitational force on the body. This happens to be the
same as the center of mass if you assume we are in a uniform
gravitational field, which is essentially true on the surface of the
Earth.</p>

<p>Have you ever sat on a beach and wondered how many grains of sand there
were? I have, but I may be a special case. Today we're going to take
that a step further, and figure out how many grains of sand there are on
the entire earth. (Caveat: I'm only going to consider sand above the
water level, since I don't have any idea what the composition of the
ocean floor is). I'm going to start by figuring out how much beach there
is in the world. If you look at a map of the world, there are four main
coasts that run, essentially, a half circumference of the world. We'll
say the total length of coast the world has is roughly two
circumferences. As an order of magnitude, I would say that the average
beach width is 100 m, and the average depth is 10 m. This gives a total
beach volume of $$ (100 m)(10 m)(4 \pi (6500 km) )= 82 km^3$$ That's
not a whole lot of volume. Let's think about deserts. The Sahara desert
is by far the largest sandy desert in the world. Just as a guess, we'll
assume that the rest of the sandy deserts amount to 20% (arbitrary
number picked staring at a map) as much area as the Sahara. According to
wikipedia the area of the Sahara is 9.4 million km^2. We'll take, to an
order of magnitude, that the sand is 100 m deep. 10 m seems to little,
and 1 km too much. That amounts to \~1 million km^3 of sand. We're
going to assume that a grain of sand is about 1 mm in radius The volume
occupied by a grain of sand is then 1 mm^3. Putting that together with
our previous number for the occupied volume gives $$ \frac{1\cdot
10^6 km^3}{1 mm^3}=\frac{1 \cdot 10^{15}}{1\cdot
10^{-9}}=1\cdot 10^{24}$$ That's a lot of grains of sand. Addendum:
Carl Sagan is quoted as saying</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The total number of stars in the Universe is larger than all the
grains of sand on all the beaches of the planet Earth"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we just use our beach volume, that gives a total number of grains of
sand as \~1*10^20, which is large, but not as large as what we found
above. Is that less than the number of stars in in the universe? Well,
that's a question for another day (or google), but the answer is, to our
best estimate/count, yes.</p>

Apologies for the hiatus recently, it's been a busy time (when isn't
it). I hope to get back to talking about experiments soon, but for now I
wanted to write up a quick problem I thought up a while back. The
question is this: how long does a molecule of H2O on earth remain in the
liquid state, on average? I'm going to treat this purely as an order of
magnitude problem. I'm also going to have to start with one assumption
that is almost certainly inaccurate, but makes things a lot easier. I'm
going to assume perfect mixing of all of the water on earth. Given that
assumption, I really only need to figure out two things. The first is
how much liquid water there is on earth. The second is now much liquid
water leaves the liquid phase each year. Let's start with the total
amount of liquid water on earth. This is relatively easy to estimate. I
happen to know that about 70% of the earth's surface is covered in
water. Most all of that is ocean. To an order of magnitude, the average
depth of the ocean must be 1 km, as it is certainly not 100 m or 10 km
[1]. For a thin spherically shell, the volume of the shell is roughly $$
4 \pi r_e^2 \Delta r $$ where r_e is the radius of the earth. Thus,
the total volume of water on the earth is $$.7<em>4 \pi r_e^2 (1 km)$$
Now, we need to figure out how much H20 leaves the liquid phase every
year. To an order of magnitude, it rains 1 m everywhere on earth each
year, it's not .1 m or 10 m [2]. I'm going to ignore any
freezing/melting in the ice caps, assuming that is small fraction of the
water that leaves the liquid phase each year. Since we have a closed
system, all the water that rains must have left the liquid phase. So, on
average, the total volume of water that leaves the liquid phase is $$4
\pi r_e^2 (1 m) $$ Thus, the fraction of liquid water that changes
phase per year is $$ \frac{4 \pi r_e^2 (1m)}{.7</em>4\pi r_e^2 (1
km)} = .0014 $$ This means that, given my assumption of perfect mixing,
in somewhere around 1/.0014 = 700 yr all of the water on earth will have
cycled through the vapor phase. Since we're only operating to an order
of magnitude, I'll call this 1000 years. This is the answer to our
question if every molecule has been in the vapor phase once in 1000
years, then we expect a molecule to stay in the liquid phase for 1000
years [1] According to wikipedia, this is really about 4 km, so we're
underestimating a bit. [2] According to wikipedia, this is spot on (.99
m on average).</p>

  Citizen's Bank Park</p>
<hr>
<p>I like baseball. Well, technically, I like <del>laying</del>[3] lying on the
couch for three hours half-awake eating potato chips and mumbling
obscenities at the television. But let's not split hairs here.
Anyway, out of curiosity and in partial atonement for the sins of my
past [1] I would now like to do a quick calculation to see how much
effect the Coriolis force has on a home-run ball.
The Coriolis force is one of the artificial forces we have to put in if
we are going to pretend the Earth is not rotating. For a nice intuitive
explanation of the Coriolis force see <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/04/coriolis-force-in-a-wipeout-rotating-slide/">this
post</a>
over at Dot Physics.
Let's now consider the following problem. Citizen's Bank Park (home to
the Philadelphia Phillies) is oriented such that the line from home
plate to the foul pole in left field runs essentially South-North.
Imagine now that Ryan Howard hits a hard shot down the third base line
(that is, he hits the ball due North). Assuming it is long enough to be
a home run, how with the Coriolis force effect the ball's trajectory?
This is a well-posed problem and we could solve it as exactly as we
wanted. But please don't <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0Bwd5hrDOxWsrOGZmMWZkYzQtM2M2Ny00NjlmLTgyYmMtNTQwZjI1ODU1NWI4&amp;hl=en_US">make
me</a>.
It's icky and messy and I don't feel like it. So let's do some
dimensional analysis! Hooray for that!
So what are the relevant physical quantities in this problem? Well,
we'll certainly need the angular velocity of the Earth and the speed of
the baseball. We'll also need the acceleration due to gravity. Alright,
so what do we want to get out of this? Well, ideally we'd like to find
the distance the ball is displaced from its current trajectory. So is
there any way we can combine an angular velocity, linear velocity and
acceleration to get a displacement?
Let's see. We can write out the dimensions of each in terms of some
length, L, and some time, T. So:
$$ \left[ \Omega \right] = \frac{1}{T} $$
$$ \left[ v \right] = \frac{L}{T} $$
$$ \left[ g \right] = \frac{L}{T^2} $$
where we have used the notation that [some quantity] = units of that
quantity. Combining these in a general way gives: $$ L = \left[
v^{\alpha} \Omega^{\beta} g^{\gamma} \right] = \left(
\frac{L}{T}\right)^{\alpha}\left(
\frac{1}{T}\right)^{\beta}\left( \frac{L}{T^2}\right)^{\gamma}
= L^{\alpha+\gamma} T^{-(\alpha+\beta+2\gamma)}$$ Since we want
just want a length scale here, we need: $$\alpha+\gamma =
1\~\~\~\mbox{and}\~\~\~\alpha+\beta+2\gamma = 0. $$
We can fiddle around with the above two equations to get two new
equations that are both functions of alpha. This gives: $$\beta =
\alpha - 2\~\~\~\mbox{and}\~\~\~\gamma = 1 - \alpha. $$
Unfortunately, we have two equations and three unknowns, so we have an
infinite number of solutions. I've listed a few of these in the Table
below.</p>

  Ways of getting a length</p>
<hr>
<p>At this point, we have taken Math as far as we can. We'll now have to
use some physical intuition to narrow down our infinite number of
solutions to one. Hot dog! One way we can choose from these expressions
is to see which ones have the correct dependencies on each variable. So
let's consider what we would expect to happen to the deflection of our
baseball by the Coriolis force if we changed each variable. What happens
if we were to "turn up" the gravity and make g larger? If we make g much
larger, then a baseball hit at a given velocity will not be in the air
as long. If the ball isn't in the air as long, then it won't have as
much time to be deflected. So we would expect the deflection to decrease
if we were to increase g. This suggests that g should be in the
denominator of our final expression. What happens if we turn up the
velocity of the baseball? If we hit the ball harder, then it will be in
the air longer and thus we would expect it to have more time to be
deflected. Since increasing the velocity would increase the deflection,
we would expect v to be in the numerator. What happens if we turn up the
rotation of the Earth? Well, if the Earth is spinning faster, it's able
to rotate more while the ball is in the air. This would result in a
greater deflection in the baseball's path. Thus, we would expect this
term to be in the numerator. So, using the above criteria, we have
eliminated everything on that table with alpha less than 3 based on
physical intuition. Unfortunately, we still have an infinite number of
solutions to choose from (i.e. all those with alpha greater than or
equal to 3). But, we DO have a candidate for the "simplest" solution
available, namely the case where alpha = 3. Since we have exhausted are
means of winnowing down our solutions, let's just go with the alpha = 3
case. Our dimensional analysis expression for the deflection of a
baseball is then $$ \Delta x \sim \frac{v^3 \Omega}{g^2} $$
Plugging in typical values of $$ v =
50\~\mbox{m/s}\~\~\~(110\~\mbox{mi/hr}) $$ $$ \Omega = 7 \times
10^{-5}\~\mbox{rad/s} $$ $$ g = 9.8\~\mbox{m/s}^2 $$ we get $$
\Delta x \approx 0.1\~\mbox{m} = 10\~\mbox{cm}. $$ That's all fine
and good, but which way does the ball get deflected? Is it fair or foul?
Well, remembering that the Coriolis force is given by: $$ {\bf F} =
-2m{\bf \Omega} \times {\bf v} $$ and utilizing Ye Olde Right Hand
Rule, we see that a ball hit due north will be deflected to the East. In
the case of Citizen's Bank Park, that is fair territory. But how good is
our estimate? Well, I did the full calculation (which you can find
<a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0Bwd5hrDOxWsrOGZmMWZkYzQtM2M2Ny00NjlmLTgyYmMtNTQwZjI1ODU1NWI4&amp;hl=en_US">here</a>)
and found that the deflection due to the Coriolis force is given by $$
\Delta x =-\frac{4}{3}\frac{\Omega v^3_0}{g^2} \cos \phi
\sin^3 \alpha \left[1 -3 \tan \phi \cot \alpha \right] $$
where phi is the latitude and alpha is the launch angle of the ball. We
see that this is essentially what we found by dimensional analysis up to
that factor of 4/3 and some geometrical terms. Not bad! Plugging in the
same numbers we used before, along with the appropriate latitude and a
45 degree launch angle we find that the ball is deflected by: $$ \Delta
x = 5\~\mbox{cm}. $$ For comparison, we note that the diameter of a
baseball is 7.5 cm. So in the grand scheme of things, this effect is
essentially negligible. [2] That wraps up the calculation, but I'm
certain that many of you are still a little wary of this voodoo
calculating style. And you should be! Although dimensional analysis will
give you a result with the proper units and will <em>often</em> give you
approximately the right scale, it is not perfect. But, it can be
formalized and made rigorous. The rigorous demonstration for dimensional
analysis is due to Buckingham and his famous pi-theorem. The original
paper can be found behind a pay-wall
<a href="http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v4/i4/p345_1">here</a> and a really nice
set of notes can be found
<a href="http://www.math.ntnu.no/~hanche/notes/buckingham/buckingham-a4.pdf">here</a>.
It's a pretty neat idea and I highly recommend you check it out!
