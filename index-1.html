            </header><div class="e-content entry-content">
                    <p>The other day I was on my way through ye olde internets to the Quantum
Leap episode index at Wikipedia, but stumbled over a quote by Feynman by
accident:
"There are 10^11 stars in the galaxy. That used to be a huge number.
But it's only a hundred billion. It's less than the national deficit! We
used to call them astronomical numbers. Now we should call them
economical numbers"
So this got me thinking. What if we decided to pay the national
debt...in pennies? Seems fair enough, we don't really want to pay it and
when you don't want to pay something but you have to you pay it in
pennies. Hooray!
Last I heard this figure was somewhere around $10,000,000,000,000 (ten
trillion), that is:
$$ \text{Debt} = 10^{13} \text{dollars} = 10^{15} \text{pennies} $$
Given that a penny is about 1.5 mm thick, how far does stacking them end
to end take us? Well:
$$ \text{Length} = (10^{15} \text{pennies}) \times ( 0.15
\text{cm}) = 1.5 \times 10^{14} \text{cm} $$
As a bit of comparison, the mean distance from the earth to the sun is
$$ \text{a} = 1.5 \times 10^{13} \text{cm,} $$
so our penny stack goes out to 10 AU, which just barely passes by
Saturn. Impressive!
Fine, so we've got all our pennies out now and we want to fit them in a
more economical fashion, taking advantage of all three of our
dimensions. How big is the warehouse needed to hold all these shiny
Lincolns?
Well, we know (or can guess) that one penny weighs about a gram
(technically 2.5 g). So if we were to know the density of a penny, we
would be good to go. A good guess at density for any metal is around 10
g /cm^3 , and this is true for zinc ( FUN FACT: Pennies were almost
entirely made of copper up until 1982, when they switched to 97.5% zinc,
2.5% copper). So,
$$ \text{Mass} = (10^{15} \text{pennies}) \times ( 1 \frac{
\text{g}}{\text{penny}})= 10^{15} \text{g} $$
$$ \text{Volume} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{density}} =
\frac{10^{15}\text{g}}{10 \frac{\text{g}}{\text{cm}^{3}}} =
10^{14} \text{cm}^{3}= 0.1 \text{km}}^{3} $$
That's a warehouse 1 km wide, 1km long, and a 100 m high. Pretty big. So
our next logical progression would be to ask: what are its gravitational
properties? To do this let's stack our pennies in a sphere. In that case
we have
$$ \text{Volume} = \frac{4 \pi}{3} \text{R}^{3} $$
so
$$ \text{R} = (\frac{3}{4 \pi} \text{Volume})^{1/3} = (\frac{3}{4
\pi} 10^{14} \text{cm}^{3})^{1/3} \approx 3 \times 10^4
\text{cm}=0.3 \text{km.} $$
To find the gravitational binding energy of a sphere of uniform density
we use
$$ \text{Binding Energy} = \frac{3}{5}
\frac{\text{G}\text{M}^{2}}{R}\text{.} $$
So
$$ \text{Binding Energy} = \frac{3}{5} \frac{ (7 \times 10^{-8}
\frac{cm^3}{gs^2})(10^{15} \text{g})^{2}}{3 \times 10^{4}
\text{cm}} \approx 10^{18} \text{ergs} = 10^{11} \text{Joules.} $$
Noting that the useful measure of destruction, the kiloton of TNT, is
about 10^12 J, we see that the binding energy of our spherical mass of
pennies is about 100 tons of TNT. So what does this mean to us
practically? Well, the binding energy of an object essentially tells us
how much energy we need to put in to completely break up the body. So to
fully disperse our pennies off to our lendors, we need about 100 tons of
TNT worth of energy.
An alternative financial fermi problem that might be interesting is how
many trees would it take to make the money to equal the national debt or
GDP?</p>

<p>Aaron Santos over at <a href="http://diaryofnumbers.blogspot.com/">A Diary of
Numbers</a>, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Many-Licks-Estimate-Anything/dp/0762435607">How Many
Licks?</a>,
has posted a <a href="http://diaryofnumbers.blogspot.com/2010/04/fermi-contest-3.html">Fermi
Contest</a>.
For the uninitiated, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem">Fermi
Problem</a> is a seemingly
unanswerable problem, which you can actually estimate reasonable by
breaking the problem down into smaller parts. They're really fun, and I
intend to post more in the future. The question at hand is: <em>How far
would the oceans sink if we took all the fish out?</em> I'll answer in two
very different ways.</p>
<h4>Preliminaries</h4>
<p>In both cases, I'll answer how much the ocean depth would decrease by
first calculating the total volume of fish in the ocean. Why is this
helpful? Because for a spherical shell, you can estimate its volume by
just taking its surface area and multiplying by the thickness, i.e. $$ V
\sim 4 \pi R^2 \Delta R $$ So, if I can estimate the total volume of
fish in the ocean, if I take all of those fish out, change in the height
of the ocean will just be this volume divided by the surface area of the
ocean, which I will take to be the surface area of the earth times 70%
or so. Now I just need to estimate the volume of all of the fish in the
oceans...</p>
<h4>Energy Budget</h4>
<p>First I'll estimate the volume of fish in a rather general way. I'll try
to do it on energy grounds. I know how much solar energy hits the earth
per meter squared on average (340 W/m^2). I'm going to assume that fish
get their energy from plankton, and plankton get their energy from the
sun, both with about 10% efficiency. I'll also assume that life occupies
as much space as possible, probably about half of the ocean surface
counts as liveable. From this I get the total energy available to make
fish. How many fish does that allow? I'll assume that fish use about as
much energy per kilogram as humans do. I know that humans have to take
in about 2000 food Calories or 2,000,000 calories a day to survive. From
this I get the total weight of all of the fish in the ocean, and for
their volume I assume they're the density of water (fish are bouyant).
My calculation: $$ \underset{\text{ \tiny mean solar flux} }{\left(
340 \frac{\text{W}}{\text{m}^2} \right)} \cdot \underset{\text{
\tiny earth surface}}{4 \pi \left( 6 \times 10^6 \text{ m}
\right)^2} \cdot \underset{\text{ \tiny frac ocean}}{(0.70)}
\cdot \underset{\text{ \tiny frac liveable} }{\left( \frac 12
\right)} = 5.4 \times 10^{20} \text{ W} \text{ (ocean life energy
budget)} $$ $$ \cdot \underset{ \text{\tiny plankton eff}}{(0.10)}
\cdot \underset{\text{\tiny fish eff}}{(0.10)} = 5.4 \times
10^{18} \text{ W} \text{ (fish energy budget)} $$ $$ \cdot
\underset{\text{\tiny energy budget of man}}{\left( \frac{ 75
\text{ kg} }{ 2 \times 10^6 \text{ cal/day} } \right)} \cdot
\underset{\text{\tiny cal $\leftrightarrow$ Ws}}{\left( \frac{ 1
\text{ cal} }{ 4 \text{ Ws} } \right)} \cdot
\underset{\text{\tiny s $\leftrightarrow$ day}}{\left( \frac{ 60
\cdot 60 \cdot 24 \text{ s} }{ 1 \text{ day} } \right)} = 4.4
\times 10^{14} \text{ kg} \text{ (mass of fish)} $$ $$ \cdot
\underset{ \rho_{\text{fish}} = \rho_{\text{water}} }{\left(
\frac{ 1 \text{ m}^3 }{ 1000 \text{ kg} } \right)} \cdot
\underset{ \text{\tiny ocean surface}}{\left( \frac{ 1}{ 4 \pi (6
\times 10^6 \text{ m})^2 (0.7) } \right)} = \text{ change in depth
(m)} = 1.38 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m} \approx 1 \text{ mm} $$ So in
the end I get about a millimeter change in the ocean height. Honestly,
this is a lot larger than I expected. The ocean is a big place. I
suppose there are also a lot of fish in the world. If you look, if we
assume the average fish is about 10 kg, I've calculated that the
population of fish in the ocean is 4.4E13 fish, or 4 million billion
fish. That's a lot of fish. I'm not so sure about my estimate, so I'll
do it again from a different direction...</p>
<h4>Fishing</h4>
<p>Next, I'll try and estimate again, this time guessing based on how much
we fish fish. I know that overfishing is a problem, which means that for
some fish species we fish more than fish make little fishies, so if I
can estimate how much fish we eat, I can estimate how much we fish, so I
can estimate how many fish there are, and then I can estimate how much
the ocean depth changes. This calculation is very rough, I took some
very basic order of magnitude guesses at some of the parameters. In
particular, I had to guess how many fish species we fish, which I took
to be 1/100 for no very good reason. My calculation is below: $$
\underset{\text{ \tiny fish eaten per person}}{ \left( \frac{ 1
\text{ fish}}{ 1 \text{ week}} \right)} \cdot \underset{\text{
\tiny fish weight}}{\left( \frac{1 \text{ kg}}{1 \text{
fish}}\right)} \cdot \underset{ \text{ \tiny week
$\leftrightarrow$ year}}{ \left( \frac{ 52 \text{ weeks}}{ 1 \text{
year} }\right)} \cdot \underset{\text{\tiny people who eat
fish}}{\left( 10^9 \right)} =5.2 \times 10^{9} \text{ fish/year
fished} $$ $$ \cdot \underset{\text{\tiny fish we eat}}{ \left(
\frac{100 \text{ tot fish}}{1 \text{ fish eaten}} \right) } \cdot
\underset{\text{\tiny fish lifetime}}{\left( 10 \text{ years}
\right)} = 5.2 \times 10^{13} \text{ kg (total fish)}$$ $$ \cdot
\underset{ \rho_{\text{fish}} = \rho_{\text{water}} }{\left(
\frac{ 1 \text{ m}^3 }{ 1000 \text{ kg} } \right)} \cdot
\underset{ \text{\tiny ocean surface}}{\left( \frac{ 1}{ 4 \pi (6
\times 10^6 \text{ m})^2 (0.7) } \right)} = \text{ change in depth
(m)} = 1.6 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m} \approx 0.2 \text{ mm} $$ This
time I got 0.2 mm or so, which is in relatively good agreement with my
other number. At least its not several orders of magnitude off.</p>
<h4>Geometric Average</h4>
<p>Honestly I trust my first number more than the second, but I'm going to
average my two results in order to come up with the number that I'll
submit to the contest. But, I'm not going to average my two numbers
arithmatically: $$ \mu = \frac{1}{2} ( x_1 + x_2 ) $$ as you
normally do to average numbers, instead I am going to average them
<em>geometrically</em>, i.e. I'm going to take the square root of their
product: $$ \mu = \sqrt{ x_1 x_2 } $$</p>
<h4>My Answer</h4>
<p>This kind of averaging is logarithmic in nature, and my experience has
been that it is much more successful average to use when you are doing
fermi problems. Doing this on my two numbers I obtain my entry: $$
\Delta x = \sqrt{ 0.164 \text{ mm} * 1.38 \text{ mm} } \approx
\frac{1}{2} \text{ mm} $$ About half a millimeter. I'll be sure to let
everyone know how I do in the contest. Drop us an email or leave a
comment to let me know how good you think my guess is. Happy Fishing.</p>

                    <p>Today I'd like to approach a question near and dear to many a geek
heart: do laser guns have recoil?
<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_SYZpxZOlcb0/S76cWh0vVrI/AAAAAAAAAA8/3AVsx5suF0A/s1600/19990814dogfight.jpg"><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_SYZpxZOlcb0/S76cWh0vVrI/AAAAAAAAAA8/3AVsx5suF0A/s200/19990814dogfight.jpg"></a>
Let's motivate our question a little bit. I've wondered about this
question since I saw star wars. Though I'm no firearms expert, the
recoil in guns must come from conservation of momentum principles.
Momentum is conserved in a system. The gun starts with zero momentum. We
fire, give the bullet momentum, and so to keep the system at zero
momentum, the gun must gain equal and opposite momentum. That is, the
gun will move backwards. All of that was for conventional guns. Light
carries momentum, so if we fire a pulse of light, we expect our laser
gun to recoil. So yes, they do have recoil. Satisfied, dear readers?
Neither am I. The question we really mean to ask is, does a laser gun
have noticeable recoil? We need to make a few reasonable assumptions.
Let's assume that the laser gun fires a pulse with as much energy as a
bullet has kinetic energy, KE. The energy, E, of light is related to its
momentum, p, by E=pc, where c is the speed of light. This gives a
momentum of $$ E=KE=pc $$ $$ p=\frac{KE}{c}$$ What is the kinetic
energy of a bullet? A little searching reveals that a .22 bullet is
\~2.5g and fires with a muzzle velocity of \~330m/s. Kinetic energy is
given by KE=1/2mv^2, where m is mass and v velocity. So, the momentum
of a laser pulse with equal energy would be $$ p=\frac{mv^2}{2c} $$ $$
p=\frac{.0025kg<em>(330m/s)^2}{2</em>3\cdot 10^8m/s} $$ $$
p=4.5\cdot10^{-7}kg \cdot m/s $$ For comparison, the momentum (p=mv)
of a .22 bullet is .83 kg<em>m/s. The momentum of a laser gun is 2 million
times less than the momentum of a .22. But is momentum all we should
consider? I suspect the 'kick' we feel on the recoil is directly related
to the force that the gun exerts on the holder. This means that instead
of momentum we need to consider impulse, momentum per time. We estimate
the time it takes to fire a .22 is \~.1s, so the force delivered 8.3 N.
Let's estimate the time it takes a laser gun to fire. Unfortunately, not
having a laser gun to fire (feel free to send me one, dear readers),
we're more or less going to have to guess at the firing time. Most
movies with laser guns show pulses of light (which, incidentally would
move so fast we wouldn't see them) on the order of a meter or two long.
Given the speed of light, this would give a firing time of \~30
nanoseconds. This would give a force delivered of 15 N. This is close to
what we estimated or a .22. So, if movies are to be believed (and
really, why wouldn't we believe them?), it seems like laser guns may
well have recoil. </em>Note: It is worth questioning if we need the same
energy for a laser as for a bullet. That could certainly change our
estimate. Maybe we'll return to this question again.*</p>

<p>"Holy lack of self control, Batman!"
Cornell University Department of Physics-A P6510 Auxiliary Report
<strong>Introduction:</strong>
I feel terrible. Batman made me feel terrible. Batman also cost me 20
bucks.
<strong>Theoretical Background:</strong>
You see, it's pretty natural for humans to place the mind and body
within hypothetical constraints. "What would it be like to be
deaf/blind? What if you didn't have an arm? What if you were forced to
watch reruns of Quantum Leap for 24 hours straight?". I guess this is in
some way a thinking-man's survival instinct. It's always prudent to be
prepared, even if just emotionally, and Scott Bakula can be kinda pushy.
We here at the Virtuosi believe in preparation. That's why we've decided
to convert one of our own (me) into a guinea pig. It is our goal to
apply some actual constraints to a real mind (mine) and to observe the
results, thereby gleaning valuable insights into how humans (me) respond
to adverse conditions (psychological torture).
<strong>Experimental Procedure:</strong>
This week we started small. My task was the simple omission of a single
word from my written and spoken vocabulary. The word should be innocuous
enough that I wouldn't usually say it, but common enough not to be
obscure. The word chosen was BATMAN. I was to expressly abstain from the
use of BATMAN, else risk a monetary penalty (20 bucks), and if I were
successful after 1 week, I would gain a monetary reward (20 bucks). This
experiment (bet) began two days ago. I have obviously failed.
<strong>Data Tables:</strong>
Data in this case, and always, will be presented with the utmost
objectivity (stream of consciousness).
<strong>Day one:</strong>
Ha This is really easy Everybody keeps mentioning Shatfan<strong> though I
don't even know what we're testing I do kinda wanna say it though 20
bucks Shatfan feels kinda dirty Whatever this is dumb I have homework
maybe I should just stop thinking about Shatfan Nah This is kinda fun I
don't wanna lose 20 bucks I liked Val Kilmer as Shatfan, I can't believe
Nic disagrees Catban Batmatt HA thought I lost it there NOWP there are
so many alternatives Shut the hell up Corky [possessor of said $20] Oh
man everybody knows about this bet I might lose What if someone asks me
about fratcan in class?
</strong>Day two:<strong>
I actually feel kinda gross thinking about Shatfan he's like in my mouth
please get him out this is all people talk about when I'm around oh yeah
thanks for that this week will at least be comical hey this might offset
the 500 bucks I owe corky maybe I could just say it and not tell anybody
ah but no that's not science and this is very obviously science<em>manbat
tabnam batfarm man of bats shatbat</em> oh hey dad whats up yea we're doing
this thing where I cant say BATMAN...
Dad: oops! uh....
Me: crap. I have phone calls to make. I'll talk to you later dad.
<em>click</em>
</strong>Post Failure Data:**
Batman is dirty. I don't even want to say it now.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Shatfan is the preferred euphemism for BATMAN.
</strong>Analysis:<strong>
We therefore conclude it is impossible (for me) not to say BATMAN for
longer than approximately two days. It was assumed by observers that the
continual substitution of Shatfan and derivatives (highlighted above)
for BATMAN was purely cavalier. This is false. While a bit of joviality
was included in the experiment, a vast majority of euphemisms used were
to assuage psychological tension. This was accompanied by laughter to
maximize psychological relief. Obviously experimental procedures must be
altered. We propose now an alternate method of success, via locking the
subject in his office for a week.
</strong>Conclusions:<strong>
In this report we find that I am a weakling, and that the experiment was
kind of lame. However, as a test run for future Prohibitive Tests (PTs)
we find the concept promising, in that when Scott Bakula comes around,
I'll be the only one ready to take him on.
Current developments in PTs include subject which are not fit for print,
and thus the authors invite suggestions in which a mundane aspect of my
life will be removed for the greater good of mankind.
</strong>Acknowledgements:**
The authors would like to acknowledge that Corky is a shatfan. Stay
tuned for more.

            </header><div class="e-content entry-content">
                    <p>Hello everyone! Since this is my first post as one of the virtuosi, I
should probably introduce myself a little. I'm a first year graduate
student in physics at Cornell university. I did my undergraduate work at
Oberlin college (I know, you've never heard of it), and I'm currently
just trying to keep my head above water and take in as much physics as I
can. Additionally, I'm trying to find work for the summer, I might post
more on that later. Today, the question that is on my mind is: How much
does a water droplet heat up when it goes over niagara falls?
<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_SYZpxZOlcb0/S70wftXc-QI/AAAAAAAAAAM/ytO82-q8Rio/s1600/Aerial+View+of+Niagara+Falls,+Ontario,+Canada.jpg"><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_SYZpxZOlcb0/S70wftXc-QI/AAAAAAAAAAM/ytO82-q8Rio/s320/Aerial+View+of+Niagara+Falls,+Ontario,+Canada.jpg"></a>
(image from http://grandcanyon.free.fr/)
Let's begin with a little motivation. Why would a water droplet heat up
when it falls? Well, the physical mechanism is that as it falls through
air, air resistance dissipates energy. This energy is dissipated mostly
as heat, so we expect to put some additional heat into our water droplet
as it falls. More quantitatively, assume the water is going to fall from
some height h to the ground. The gravitational potential energy of our
water droplet is given by $$ PE=mgh $$ where m is the mass of the
droplet and g is acceleration due to gravity. We assume that the
particle starts with no initial velocity. It is very easy to place an
upper bound on how much the droplet will warm. The maximum heating will
happen if all of the potential energy were converted to thermal energy.
The temperature change wound be $$ mc\Delta T = mgh $$ so $$ \Delta T
= \frac{gh}{c} $$ Where c is the specific heat of water. Niagara falls
is 51m tall, g is 9.8m/s<em>s and c is 4.1kJ/kg</em>K so this gives a maximum
temperature change of .12C=.22F, fractions of a degree. However, we can
do better than this. A small droplet will experience a linear drag
force, and a bouyant force from the air. The combination of these will
result in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes%27_law">terminal
velocity</a> of $$
v_t=\frac{2}{9}\frac{(\rho_p-\rho_f)}{\mu} g R^2 $$ Where
$\rho_p \text{ and } \rho_f$ are the droplet and air density
respectively, $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity and R is the radius. This
gives the kinetic energy the particle gains and we assume the rest of
the potential energy goes to thermal energy. So, $$mc\Delta T =
mgh-\tfrac{1}{2}mv_t^2$$ $$\Delta T = \frac{gh-v_t^2}{c} $$ Now
we can plug in some numbers. A little bit of searching will turn up
appropriate values for the density of water (\~1000kg/m^3), the density
of air (\~1.2kg/m^3) and the dynamic viscosity of air (\~.8mPa<em>s). We
estimate the radius of a small droplet of water is 1.5mm (\~1/16"),
which seems about a medium sized raindrop. This gives a terminal
velocity of 6m/s. Using the above equation this gives a temperature
change of $$ \Delta T = .0024C/m</em>h-.009C $$ It looks like our
calculation only makes sense after the after droplet has fallen more
than 4.5m (this is probably about the distance it takes to reach
terminal velocity)! Niagara falls is 51m tall, so this gives a change in
temperature of .11C=.2F. The water only heats up by a fraction of a
degree. This more realistic estimate is still rather close to our upper
bound. I leave it as a question to you, the reader, to estimate the
temperature change of a typical raindrop.</p>

<h3>So me and Jesse got to thinking today about Railguns. Every year in Physics 213 a common homework problem is a rather simple model of a railgun. We tried to think about a more realistic model. We simulated a rail connected to a voltage source with a limiting resistor, moving under its own magnetic field with a back-emf.</h3>

<p>Short answer: Doesn't work very well if you limit the current, but works
great if you dump a MA or so down the wire.</p>
<p>See the full solution after the jump.</p>
<h4>Setup</h4>
<p>Imagine you have two closely spaced conducting rails which you connect
to a voltage source. Laid across these two rails is another piece of
conductor. The first thing to notice is that we expect the conductor, if
we assume it can slide along the rails without friction, will be
compelled to move because of the magnetic force caused by the magnetic
field from the rails acting on the current through the segment. Lets be
quantitative, our voltage source provides and emf V. The rails are
seperated by some distance L. The initial position of the slug (as it
will be termed) is $x_0$ We are interested in the motion of the slug.
It will feel a force $$ F = I \int B \cdot dl $$ The current being the
current that flows through the circuit. The important contributions to
the current is the emf of the source, the resistivity of the rails and
slug, and the back emf induced by the motion of the slug. I.e. our
equation for the circuit takes the form $$ V - I\lambda( L + 2x ) -
\frac{d}{dt} \int B dA = 0 $$ We need to approximate the magnetic
field acting on the slug. We will treat this magnetic field as
originating wholly from the rails, which we will treat as semi-infinite
wires. This approximation should be good in the limit that $L \gg x_0$
The magnetic field of a semi-infinite wire is $$ B =
\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{I}{r} $$ so our magnetic field acting on
the slug, if we treat $z=0$ to be at the bottom rail and $z=L$ to be at
the top is given by $$ B = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}I \left( \frac{1}{z}
+ \frac{1}{L-z} \right) $$ We can calculate the influence of this
field on the slug. Of course if we integrate this field from 0 to L it
will blow up, so we need to set some cutoff, $R$ which will stand in for
the fact that our wires have some finite thickness. We proceed: $$ \int
B\ dl = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} I \int_{R}^{1-R} \frac{1}{z} +
\frac{1}{L-z} \ dz = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} I
\int_{\epsilon}^{1-\epsilon} \frac{1}{\xi} + \frac{1}{1-\xi} \
d\xi $$ where I have non dimensionalized the integral with: $$
\epsilon = R/L $$ We obtain $$ \int B\ dl = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}
\left[ 2 \log \left( 1/\epsilon - 1 \right) \right] I \equiv
\kappa I $$ This gives us the force on our slug $$ F = \kappa I^2 $$
as well as an approximation for the magnetic flux if we assume that this
field approximation works for the length of the rails (up to the slug)
$$ \int B \ dA = \kappa I x $$ So that we can gather our circuit
equation $$ V - I\lambda( L + 2x ) - \kappa \frac{d}{dt}(I x) = 0 $$
and the equation of motion for our slug $$ m \ddot x = \kappa I^2 $$
Lets nondimensionalize these equations with $$ x = L \chi $$ $$ x_0 =
f L $$ $$ I = \frac{V}{r + \lambda L (1+ 2f)} \Phi \equiv I_0 \Phi
$$ marking the initial current that will flow through the slug. $$ t =
\frac{ \kappa}{2 \lambda } \tau $$ giving a characteristic time.
Putting it all together, our differential equations become much simpler.
$$ f - \chi - \frac{d}{d\tau} \left( \Phi \chi \right) = 0 $$ $$
\frac{d^2 \chi}{d\tau^2} = \beta \Phi^2 $$ $$ \beta = \frac{
\kappa^3 I_0^2 }{ 4 m L \lambda^2 } $$ So that our system is
specified completely by the dimensionless constants f, β, f having
something to say about the initial geometry of our system, and β
speaking to the relative mass of the slug.</p>
<h4>Analysis</h4>
<p>These coupled nonlinear differential equations are not easily solved,
but by taking the time to nondimensionalize them, we can integrate them
numerically. Lets suppose our rails are separated by 1 cm, and our f is
taken to be 10 or so (remember the larger f, the better our
approximation for the field). And for our material properties, lets take
gauge 0 copper wire, i.e. I will use its radius, mass density, and
conductivity at room temperature. Lets make the voltage supply be a
kilovolt (non unreasonable), and lets choose the limiting resistor in
order to keep the current in the gauge 0 wire under its specification:
170 amps. Doing all of this, we have $$ \beta \approx 5.4 \times
10^{-7} $$ $$ f = 10 $$ and for interest our characteristic time is 112
microseconds or so, the mass of our slug is about 5 grams. Our average
magnetic field is about 0.07 gauss/amp between the rails, so that our
starting field is about 12 gauss.</p>

<h4>Conclusions</h4>
<p>So it looks like our Railgun doesn't do very much at all. In fact, its
quite paltry, achieving very puny speeds. What went wrong? Well, it
seems the biggest problem comes from limiting the maximum current that
can go down our wire. The truth is that if we want to really project
some stuff forward, we're either going to need much higher currents, or
some external field. You'll notice that most of the action takes place
over a very short time scale, so it could be that we could violate the
rated currents of our wire. If that's the case, setting our failsafe
resistor to zero, I'll just show two more graphs, that of the velocity
and position of the slug:</p>

<p>This is starting to look a lot more like a Railgun, unfortunately, it
would draw a current of 15 MA to start! So the real question becomes,
how much current can you dump into a copper wire in 0.1 ms or so. 15 MA
is a lot and would certainly melt the wire, but would it melt the wire
in such a short time? If not, then it looks like we could get some real
kick out of our model. In fact, we know that railguns with some kick can
be made. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railgun">Wikipedia</a>,
the US Navy has a railgun that can accelerate a 3.2 kg projectile at 7
times the speed of sound (\~2.3 km/s). Playing with my code, if I put in
by hand a projectile mass of 3.2 kg, and reduce f to 1 (meaning we get a
little more kick but our approximation of the field starts to really
break down), I can get a final speed of about 2 km/s, which seems to be
in relatively good agreement, but this only occurs if the current is
\~100 MA for about 30 microseconds. Moral of the story, if you want to
build a railgun, you need to be willing to melt some copper. Attached is
a Mathematica notebook used for the computation:

                    <p>Being inspired by a Colloquium given today at Cornell by Chad Orzel over
at <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/principles/">Uncertain Principles</a>, I'm
going to try and resurect this old beast and begin anew. The general
plan is that I will try and read more scientific papers, translating
them into plainer english, as well as solve little problems or puzzles
that I dream up. Wish me luck, perhaps I will get some of my friends
involved.</p>
