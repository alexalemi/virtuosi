*Alemi* is a PhD physics graduate student at Cornell University.  I will be
working this summer with the Sethna Group working on a project related to
inter-atomic potentials in metals.  I got my Bachelor's from Caltech majoring
in physics.  I enjoy reading the interwebs, thinking about crazy physics
problems, dimensional analysis, and fermi problems.  I have a real thirst for
arcane and interesting trivia..

*Alex* is an experimental solid state physics graduate student in the Ralph Group
at Cornell.  He enjoys physics, but hopes to eventually switch fields into
giant robot-building.

*Corky* was discovered by Czech explorers in Greenland in the early 13th century
writing autobiographical sketches in the 3rd person.  He is now a PhD physics
graduate student at Cornell University.

*DTC* is a physics graduate student at Cornell.  He enjoys network science,
infectious disease dynamics, the history of science, word games, hiking,
traveling, octopodes, and Batman.

*Jared* was made by other people.  He makes accelerators.  Start a band with him.
Addendum by Jesse:  He is a PhD physics graduate student at Cornell University.

*Jesse* is a PhD physics graduate student at Cornell University.  He is working
with Rob Thorne's group.  He did his undergraduate at Oberlin College, where he
majored in physics and mathematics.  In his spare time, he reads lots of books,
and when the weather is nice he likes to go on hikes.  He also likes cats, and
has two cats of his very own.

Both illusive and aloof, *Js* (short for Jesse, as in tie-Jesse, and as in not
the other Jesse) has the amazing super-human ability to offend people at faster
than light speed.  Little is known about this creature, for sightings are rare
and brief.  However, when he does emerge from the lab, be sure to ask about the
time he (CENSORED) (CENSORED) (CENSORED) with a massive (CENSORED) (CENSORED).
You won't believe this true tale!  Oh, also, Jesse graduated from Northeastern
University with B.S. degrees in physics, math and philosophy.  He now continues
his studies at the Cornell physics department.


Like the rest of the Virtuosi, *Nic Eggert* is a PhD student at Cornell. He works
on the CMS experiment, one of the detectors at the Large Hadron Collider. Nic
got his undergraduate degree in physics from the University of Minnesota. In
his spare time (not that he has much), he enjoys reading, playing video games,
playing bass guitar, and brewing beer.

*Sam* came to the Cornell physics department to try to find a way to fight the
merciless enemy of his Canadian homeland: the polar bear. The day they took his
pet beaver was the day he swore he'd have his revenge. Then he got into
accelerator physics which was much more interesting so now he mostly does that.

*Yariv* is a PhD physics graduate student at Cornell University. He is as old as
the Earth and as wise as the sky. He came across the sea in a great machine
made of metal and plastic accompanied by a mysterious cat who sees the future.
In physics he's bounced from neutron form factors to percolation models,
through deuteron beams to high-dimensional black holes. Sometimes he thinks he
should have stuck with one of these subjects.
