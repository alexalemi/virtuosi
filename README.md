# The Virtuosi Blog

This repo serves as the content for [thephysicsvirtuosi.com](http://thephysicsvirtuosi.com)
a now nearly defunct blog I and some friends used to run in grad school. The site has been
converted from its old blogger format to now a static site, generated with [Nikola](https://getnikola.com/)
and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).
