    <p>Another week has gone by here in Cornell. The last leaves are turning
red, a hint of snow passed us on the weekend, and the undergrads have
hit the streets and parties in minimal clothing, then did the same again
next day wearing a set of cat ears. And in the physics department, we
had the usual three talks. On Monday, the colloquium speaker was Holger
MÃ¼ller from UC Berkeley, talking about Gravitational Redshift,
Equivalence Principle, and Matter Waves. The center of the talk was
Muller's experimental device, an atom interferometer. Many of you will
remember the Michelson-Morley interferometer, the device used to
disprove the existence of the ether. A light-interferometer essentially
takes a beam of light, splits it in two and then merges it back again,
using the result of the interference between the two parts to learn
something about the relative difference between the optical paths taken
by the two. The atom interferometer, then, performs a similar function
with atom wavefunctions. An atom is shot up into the air and a laser is
directed towards it and calibrated to interact with the atom half the
time. The atom's wavefunction is split two trajectories, at the end of
which another laser is calibrated to bring the two paths back together.
The detector can then measure the path difference between the two
trajectories, and as we have excellent ways of measuring time and the
mass and energy of the atom, this amounts to a very accurate measurement
of g, the free-fall constant. Muller went on to show how his team has
been using the interferometer to perform very accurate measurements of
General Relativity, from its isotropy to the universality of free fall
motion for objects of different masses. There were some neat tricks
described, and they mentioned the ability to measure those <a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/09/microseconds-and-miles_7470.html">minute
differences</a>
in gravity experienced by moving the system one meter upwards. It's
always a little difficult to get excited about tests that confirm an
accepted theory, especially one like General Relativity, but I think
this is important work. To paraphrase the words of fellow Virtuos Jared,
GR is always going to be right up until we find where it breaks. On
Wednesday, David Kaplan talked about Conformality Lost. This talk was
about QCD, but not about QCD. One of the features of QCD, or really
field theories in general, is the running of the coupling constants.
Where in classical theories the strength of the interaction between two
particles is constant and depends only on the distance between them,
field theory shows us how the strength of the interaction changes with
the energy of the participating particles. This is crucial, for
instance, for theories of grand unification that posit that the known
forces are all the same at very high energies. In QCD, in particular,
the running of the constant also has to with confinement and asymptotic
freedom. Confinement is the notion that quarks can never break free of
each other, and so we never observe them alone in nature, only within
particles such as protons, neutrons, baryons and mesons. Asymptotic
freedom is the notion that at high energies, if we collide another
particle with a quark, it behaves as if it was free of other influence.
If we associate long distances with low energy and short distances with
high energy, we can see how the coupling must flow from very small at
one end to very large at the other end. One of the interesting things
about the running of the coupling is that it defines a scale for the
theory. If the coupling is different for particles of energy E~1~ and
E~2~, then we can choose some value of the coupling and describe our
energy in relation to the energy relative to this scale. Theories
without running coupling are called conformal and have no natural scale.
QCD, it seems, behave this way if you take it all the way to asymptotic
freedom. Kaplan talked about the investigation of this conformal stage
of the theory, its existence and inexistence. As an analog he showed a
quantum-mechanical system of a particle in a Coulombic, potential. The
minimum energy of this system is given by solution of a quadratic
equation, which can have either two solutions, one or none, depending on
the relation between the mass of the particle and the strength of the
potential. A scale exists in this case only if there are two solutions:
a single energy is meaningless, of course, because we can always add a
constant, but if there's two of them then the difference defines a
scale. This toy model, it turns out, can be analogous to a QCD with the
equivalent parameter being the relative number of flavors (kind of
particles) and colors (different charges in the theory, red, blue and
green in our regular QCD). There were a number of interesting results
from this model, the most exciting one, perhaps, being the possible
existence of a "mirror" QCD theory beyond the conformal point of QCD, a
sort of theory with a different number of colors and different gauge
groups. Kaplan ended his talk by talking of at least one possible
candidate for this mirror theory that they had recently found. Finally,
on Friday, we had Ami Katz from Boston University talk about CFT/AdS.
AdS/CFT has been a big buzzword for the last decade or so. The CFT here
stands for conformal field theory of the kind mentioned in the previous
summary, and AdS stands for Anti-de Sitter space, a geometry of
spacetime possible in general relativity. The slash in between stands
for a duality that allows results from one theory to be interpreted in
the other and vice versa. This has some exciting implications since it
allows us to use each theory in the regime where we can solve it.
Particle theorists are, in general, trying to use the CFT to solve for
high-energy theories that behave like AdS. Katz had apparently rewritten
the duality as CFT/AdS, to signal that he was asking the opposite
question, starting with a CFT and asking whether it is a good fit for
the duality. A large part of the talk was dedicated to making an analogy
from CFTs into conventional field theories. We know pretty well when a
field theory is a good description of reality and when it tends to break
down. This has to do, usually, with some cutoff energy, a scale at which
new physics comes into play. As long as we stay at energies far below
that cutoff, the effects of the unknown physics will be a small
correction to the calculations we make with our known physics. In CFTs,
we had just said, there is no energy scale, and so the question must be
different. The relevant question, apparently, is the dimensionality of
operators - not what their energy scale is, but how they scale with a
change of energy. For instance, a derivative behaves like inverse
distance, and distance behaves like inverse energy, so a single
derivative scales linearly in energy, while a double derivative scale
quadratically. I didn't understand much past the half-point of this
lecture, but the bottom line appeared to be that a well-behaved CFT has
a gap in its operators dimensionality, allowing us to focus on one
operator and plenty of its derivatives before coming to the scaling of
the next operator. This kind of gap allows our perturbative corrections
to remain perturbative when we go to the AdS side. That's it for last
week, with its conformal ups and down. As usual, we're past the first
seminar of the new week, which was non-wimpy talk about WIMPs. Still
ahead this week are superconductors (and more AdS/CFT, presumably) and
some non-thermal histories of the universe. (that is, of course, if I
don't freeze first - temperatures have dropped below zero already. It's
so much colder when you work in Celsius)</p>

    <p>Good evening, and welcome to the second edition of YWiS. Last week I
took in the full range of seminars, from colloquium to Friday lunch. I
don't know if I can say I took in the full content of these talks as
well, but let's see what I learned On Monday we had Andrew Millis from
Columbia University talk about Materials with Strong Electronic
Correlations: The (Theoretical) End of the Beginning? (I think the
subtitle wasn't actually there in the talk itself). This was a condensed
matter theory talk, and like all condensed matter talks it started off
with the phase diagram for cuprates and a mention of the illustrious
pseudogap, the Dark Energy of condensed matter. The pseudogap is a phase
of cuprates - the materials that make high-temperature superconductors -
that occurs at about the same concentration of defects as
superconductivity but at a higher temperature. It is a little-understood
phase that sits between two well-understood phases (antiferromagnetism
and Fermi liquid) and perhaps holds some answers to the nature of
high-temperature superconductivity. Millis started with the pseudogap
picture and a short overview of the current state of condensed matter
theory. He claimed that perhaps some of the phases of matter in question
have local, short-range ordering, but no overarching long-range order in
the system, and that the investigation of these phases should take this
into account. At the end of this introduction he asked why we cannot
easily solve the problems of condensed matter. The basic equations that
govern the interactions in the field are known - the electromagnetic
potential and SchrÃ¶dinger's equation - and we should be able to just
plug them into a computer and calculate away. The trouble, as Millis
presented it, comes from the fermionic nature of the problem. What we're
trying to calculate, in metals, is the behavior of the electrons running
through the bulk of the metal. Electrons are fermions, which means that
no two can have the same quantum numbers, that is no two can be in the
same place with the same momentum and spin. It turns out that the
configurations with lowest energies tend to be symmetric, with many
particles in the same position. Finding low-energy configurations that
put every particle in a different place is much harder. I didn't get a
lot more from this talk. Millis went on to suggest a method that avoids
tackling the problem directly, but rather solves an analogous one that
we can translate to into a solution. I believe that there was some talk
of a local, rather than global, solution, and of the Hubbard model,
which is a popular approximation used in modeling electrons in a solid.
I phased in and out of this talk, but I'd peg my Understanding at 25
minutes, and my Interest at about 35 minutes. The Wedenesday particle
talk was by Jesse Thaler from MIT. He talked about Aspects of Goldstini.
Goldstini is the Italian plural form of goldstino, which is the
fermionic version - we put "ino" at the end of fermionic particles,
influenced by the neutrino - of the Goldstone boson. A Goldstone boson
is a massless particle that we find in theories of spontaneous symmetry
breaking. Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a popular concept in particle
physics, which springs from the concept of an unstable energy maximum.
Imagine a pencil standing on its tip, a system which is symmetric in
every direction. The pencil is unstable, though, and left by itself it
would fall down in any one of the equivalent directions around it. Once
it has fallen, it's broken the symmetry and created one preferred
direction. Thus the symmetry of the system is broken when one direction
is chosen spontaneously. This sort of thing is at the bottom of our
understanding the electroweak force, and pops up quite a bit in particle
physics. When it does, we expect a Goldstone boson, a massless particle
that roughly corresponds to spinning the fallen-down pencil around its
tip. The goldstini is the fermionic version of that particle which
springs from the breaking of supersymmetry - the symmetry that relates
fermions and bosons. The goldstino, then, is well known and accepted in
common theories of supersymmetry. It breaks supersymmetry, and then
interacts with the gravitino - another fermion, which mediates the force
of gravity - to become massless. Thaler's work posits more than one
goldstino, hence, goldstini. How can we have more than one goldstino? By
breaking supersymmetry more than once. We do this by imagining several
"sectors" in our theory, different sets of fields (particles) that break
supersymmetry but don't interact with each other significantly. When you
work through this model it turns out that you can have several
goldstini. Also, as the original goldstini lost its mass by giving it to
the gravitino, and the gravitino is now satisfied, the new goldstini get
to keep their mass, which turns out to be exactly twice that of the
(satisfied) gravitino. Thaler then discussed three possible scenarios
for this mass, and what we would expect to see at the LHC in each case.
The important thing, it turns out, is how this mass compares with that
of the lightest ordinary superpartner, the first supersymmetry-related
particle we expect to see in the LHC. If the mass of the goldstini is
very small, they will not come into play as the LOSP will decay into
particles we already know. If the mass of the goldstini is too large,
then the LOSP cannot decay into it. But if the mass is in some
goldstinilocks region in-between, things become interesting and we can
expect to see evidence of the gravitino and the goldstini, and
distinctly see one having double the mass of the other. I followed a
good portion of this talk, with Understanding of 30 minutes all in all,
and perhaps 45 minutes of interest. Finally, the Friday particle theory
lunch had a talk by our own David Curtin, one of Csaba's grad students.
He talked about Solving the gaugino mass problem in Direct Gauge
Mediation. I came into this one to follow more of it, on account of the
speaker being a student, but ended up following very little as it was
technical and above my level. It revolved, again, around supersymmetry
breaking. David does model building, which means he starts out with some
acceptable results, i.e. the universe as we know it, and tries to tinker
up a combination of particles and interactions that would reproduce it,
one portion at a time. What he was trying to build this time was a
metastable level in the broken supersymmetric potential. If we think
back to our pencil, we had an unstable maximum, the pencil standing on
its tip, and a minimum point, the pencil laying on the table, from which
it cannot fall. But we can also imagine a midpoint - perhaps resting one
side of the pencil on a book. It can't fall any further right away, but
there is another, preferred position lying flat on the table. That's
what we call a metastable energy level. As it turns out, the metastable
level has some desirable outcomes within the context of supersymmetry,
and the talk revolved around the ways we have of getting the right
energy structure to our system while avoiding things we don't want in
our models - arbitrary particle masses, a large number of new particles,
or anything blatantly unphysical. My Understanding here was quite close
to 0, as the technicalities were beyond me. (in fact, the pre-seminar
discussion was about soccer, so one might say my understanding was
negative). I probably kept trying to follow for about half the talk, or
30 minutes. That's it for last week. This week we can expect gravity,
(heavy!) Conformality Lost (literary!) and CFT/AdS (buzzwordy!). And
hopefully less headscratching and more nodding in a agreement.</p>

    <p>We've done a lot of talking over the past few months here on the
Virtuosi, but one important subject has not come up so far. An issue
that is central to the day to day life of the average grad student. The
subject of free food. The average graduate student in an American
university shops for food 0.7 times per semester, paying a total of
$13.22. He eats an average of three vegetables and one fruit, all at
home during Thanksgiving. He turns his oven on once per year while
trying to ascertain if the power is out or the light bulb in the kitchen
needs to be replaced. The rest of his nutrition is made up entirely of
free donuts, bagels and pizza. The place to get all this free food,
naturally, is various department talks and seminars. And while we're
there, we may as well try to learn some physics. With that noble goal in
mind, I'd like to welcome you to the first edition of Your Week in
Seminars, where I shall endeavor to relay the content of the weekly
seminars I attend in Cornell. On an average week this will be one
general interest colloquium and two particle theory talks. One of my
colleagues may want to take up the LASSP (Condensed Matter) talk or any
of the other seminars going around in the department I'll try to relate
what I got out of each talk, with more words than equations and with no
figures. I'll aim for a general audience level but I think I'm likely to
end up at a physics undergrad or a popular-science-savvy level, as
technical terms are bound to be thrown about. If there's one you don't
know, feel free to ask over in the comments or take this as an
opportunity to delve into Wikipedia. I'll also provide two handy metrics
to the quality of the talk, my Interest Level, defined as the amount of
time before I start playing with my phone, and my Comprehension level,
defined as the amount of time where I was still following the speaker.
Last week there was no colloquium due to Fall break, so this post will
cover just the Wednesday and Friday <a href="http://lepp.cornell.edu/Events/ParticleTheory/WebHome.html">particle
seminars</a>.
On Wednesday we had David Kagan from Columbia University tell us about
Conifunneling - Stringy Tunneling Between Flux Vacua. As you may know,
string theory demands that our universe have a large number of
dimensions, generally 10 or 11, to avoid such nastiness mass particles.
To bridge the gap between the theoretical and observed number of
dimensions (four) one has to "compactify" the extra dimensions, that is,
to posit that they have some shape and size and write down an effective
four-dimensional theory that takes their presence into account. This
compactification creates an energy surface, or some effective potential
in space. What we call "vacuum", the ground state of the universe, rests
in one of the minimum points of that potential, as ground levels are
wont to do. But it need not be the absolute minimum, just a local one,
and where there are local minima in a quantum theory we know that there
is also tunneling. Kagan, then, talks of tunneling between these local
energy minima created by compactification of the extra dimensions of
string theory. This tunneling, from what I gathered, can be described as
an evolution in time of the manifold, the geometric layout of spacetime.
The main conceit of the talk was that this evolution takes the manifold
into the form of a "conifold", which is a manifold with a conic
singularity. This conifold then nucleates a 5d-brane; branes are a
objects in string theory that have some dimensionality less than that of
the entire spacetime. After creating this object, the conifold
transforms back into a non-singular manifold, but one where the vacuum
is in another energy minimum. We can visualize this process by thinking
of spacetime as an elastic sheet of of sorts, pinched at a point and
pulled. It is deformed, creating an elongated cone-like area, until
finally it tears, emitting a five-dimensional brane, and reverting back
to its original form. There was some discussion at the end which mostly
went over my head, but at some point Henry Tye, Liam and Maxim were
trying to figure out whether the tunneling is necessarily done via a
conifold or whether Kagan was just describing what happens if it does.
The conclusion, I believe, was that it is the latter case, though Kagan
said they have some good arguments on why the conifold tunneling had to
happen. Interest: 40 minutes. Understanding: 20 minutes. On Friday we
had Zvi Lipkin from the Weizmann Institute tell us about Heavy quark
hadrons and exotics, a challenge for QCD. This talk revolved around the
constituent quark model for QCD. Our usual picture of hadrons is one of
two or three valence quarks sitting in a sea of gluons and virtual
quark-antiquark pairs, due to the strong interactions of Strong
Interaction. Lipkin's work focuses on trying to abstract this sea away
and focus on the valence quarks as if we were discussing a
hydrogen-atom-like system of two particles and a potential between them.
This kind of treatment allows us to maximize the use of flavor
symmetries. Flavor is QCD-speak for "type of particle", that is, up,
down, strange, charm and bottom quarks. Using the constituent quark
model we may be able to say things like "the difference between the
B^0^~s~ and the B^0^ (mesons made up of an anti-b and an s or d quark,
respectively) is the same as the difference between the Î^0^ and the
Î£^0^" (baryons made up of uss and uds quarks, respectively). (Don't take
that last example too seriously - I made it up by looking at lists of
baryons and mesons. But that was the gist of the talk) Lipkin showed
done by him and Marek Karliner, (who taught me differential equations in
Tel Aviv) including lots of numbers nicely matching between their theory
and experiment as well as a less-convincing attempt to characterize the
two-body potential in this two-body problem. At the end of the talk he
also mentioned the X(3872) seen by the Belle experiment. This is a
particle that does not seem to fit into our regular models as either a
baryon or a meson, and Lipkin suggested that this might be a
"tetraquark," a combination of two quarks and two antiquarks. This kind
of exotic hadron has been talked about for a long time, and there was
some excitement a few years ago with the discovery and eventual
un-discovery of the Î^+^ pentaquark. (made up of four quarks and an
antiquark) Interest: 60 minutes. (I was sitting in the front and could
not politely take out the phone) Understanding: 60 minutes.</p>

Somehow I've managed to read three books in the last two days, and each of them were excellent enough that I need to tell people about them.

<h4>Street Fighting Mathematics - Sanjoy Mahajan </h4>
<h5>The art of educated guessing and opportunistic problem solving </h5>
<div>
<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=12156">Link to MIT Press Site</a>
<p>You know that feeling you get when it's the second half of January and you put on new clothes that have just come out of the dryer?  This book is like a cross between that and a kick in the face.  </p>
<p>The warm fuzzy-clothes-out-of-the-dryer feeling will come from the realization that you can wield unsurmountable power.  The kick in the face will come when you realize you're not doing it yet.
<a name="more"></a>
The premise of the book is something along the lines of:  We've all been taught how to solve math problem exactly.  Science isn't exact.  Turns out when you realize this, you can do a heck of a lot.  Let Sanjoy show you how.</p>
<p>As an undergrad, I had the supreme fortune of taking some life changing courses.  One of the ones that has struck me the deepest was Ph 101: Order of Magnitude Physics.  It did a remarkable job building my confidence.  It's one thing to go through your classes and complete the homework assignments.  It's another thing entirely to feel as you can take a stab at just about any question anyone can ask.</p>
<p>This book is the handbook that will introduce you to the techniques and ways of thinking you'll need in order to tackle the most general of questions.  The first chapter is Dimensional Analysis, something that every high school student should be exposed to. I love Dimensional Analysis.  The rest of the book goes on to estimate Integrals, Sums and Differential Equations, thinking about limiting cases and scaling, and thinking pictorially.  </p>
<p>The best part:  it's available in a creative commons version, i.e. for free.  Just follow the creative common pdf link in the left sidebar.</p>
<p>One of the biggest flaws I see in modern physics teaching is that physics courses have a tendency of being reduced to plugging numbers into highlighted and yellow boxed equations.  That's not physics!  Physics is a way of thinking about the world.  It's the delight you obtain when you understand something for the first time.  It's the power you can wield by being able to properly predict phenomenon that only minutes ago you found baffling.  In a word: it's awesome.  In order to be able to see past all of the equations, you need to have an appreciation for how powerful intelligent approximations can be.</p>
<p>The amazing fact is that with a proper introductory physics course, you are capable of understanding a huge deal of the world around you. </p>
<p>If physics classes were taught the way Sanjoy would like them to be taught, if they relied fundamentally on the kinds of techniques he discusses, I think students would like physics a lot more.  I think the world would be a better place.<br></p>

<h4>Why Things Break  - Mark E. Eberhart </h4>

<h5>Understanding the world by the way it comes apart </h5>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TLkXVqJBxlI/AAAAAAAAAOs/WEGJaROjFhI/s1600/4115MFY61ML._SS500_.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TLkXVqJBxlI/AAAAAAAAAOs/WEGJaROjFhI/s320/4115MFY61ML._SS500_.jpg" width="320"></a></div>

<p><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=wo9wGKk9MVsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Why+Things+Break&amp;hl=eo&amp;ei=4Be5TJ6jPIL48Aa2uKzPDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Link to Google Books Page</a></p>
<p>This book was mentioned to me by someone in my group.  I decided to check it out, and read the first 70% of it in one sitting.  I think that says something about it.  </p>
<p>This is a really fun read.  It's a popular science book, but on something you've probably never read about before - material science.</p>
<p>Mixing very interesting history, science, and biography, Eberhart takes you on a journey attempting to answer the question: Why do things break?  Which he is quick to point out is probably not the question you think it is.  His life goal is not to answer what happens when things break, or which materials break sooner than others (which he manages to mention along the way anyway), but he is primarily interested in answergin why things even break in the first place, a rather subtle and non-trivial question when you think about it.</p>
<p>I actually learned quite a lot from this book.  It's full of really interesting accounts and digressions.  I can't recommend it enough.  Very fun read.</p>
<h4>Soap Bubbles - C. V. Boys </h4>

<h5>Their colours and the forces which mold them </h5>

<p><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=EcgCKTPYqCIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Link to Google Books page</a></p>
<p>I found this book by accident, but boy am I glad I found it.  It's a printing of a series of lectures the author gave to some children near the close of the 19th century about bubbles.</p>
<p>This goes into the drawer of happy little discoveries I've made of old science literature for which the copyright has expired.  Meaning its free on Google Books as a pdf download.  </p>
<p>I don't know what it is, but I find basically anything written before about 1950 at least an order of magnitude easier to understand than anything since.  Sure, some of it has to do with the fact that older science literature is necessarily dated, while new physics can tend to be a lot more complicated, and you could point out that there is a clear selection bias in the old texts that I manage to find, but I really believe there is something more to it than that.  Old science authors wrote to be understood.  You get the distinct impression that most of these guys really loved their craft and really wanted to explain their findings to others.  Sometimes I get the impression that modern articles are written less to be understood and more as the modern version of mailing your patent idea to yourself in a closed envelope - as a way to get a stamp on your lab notebook to prove you did something first.</p>
<p>That said, this little gem was not what I thought it was going to be.  Going in, I thought it would be a bunch of cool things you could do with bubbles.  Oh but it's so much more.  Boys manages in these three little lectures to give one of the clearest introductions to some basic fluid dynamics and electricity I've seen.  Boys manages to teach, and while using bubbles.</p>
<p>I recommend it.  If not for the science and cool bubble tricks, I think it can serve as another find indicating that physics education doesn't need to be boring in order to get real ideas planted.</p>
<h4>Calculus Made Easy - Silvanus Phillips Thompson </h4>

<h5>Being a very-simplest introduction to those beautiful methods of reckoning which are generally called by the terrifying names of the DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS and INTEGRAL CALCULUS</h5>

<p><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BrhBAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Calculus+Made+Easy&amp;hl=eo&amp;ei=WRu5TKDJLsT38Ab4wNiaDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Google Books Link</a> - another freebie</p>
<p>I have to admit, I didn't just read this one.  I read it a while ago, but while writing up the other ones I could let such a fantastical book as this pass by without mention.</p>
<p>Another book I found by accident for free on Google Books.  If I remember correctly, this one was pure serendipity.  But it has to be the best introductory calculus book ever written.  Seriously.  I don't joke about these things.  I fell in love with it as soon as I finished reading the subtitle (and the author's name).</p>
<p>This. book. rocks.  If nothing else, do yourself a favor and read the first couple chapters of this bad boy.  It's free.  I won't hurt.</p>
<p>It's so good, I read it online.  Then I checked it out from the library.  Then I bought the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Calculus-Made-Easy-CALCULUS-MADE/dp/B001TIKS36/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1287200177&amp;sr=8-4">shiny new edition</a> because I needed to have it on my shelf.  Turns out I'm not the only one in love with the book.  Martin Gardner so loved it as to release the shiny edition with recreational problems and his commentary.</p>
<p>This is not Calculus crib notes.  This is not spark notes or Calculus for Dummies.  This is not just a condensed version of the calculus book you used in highschool.  This isn't just a list of formulas.  This book <i>explains</i> what calculus is.  You do not understand what I meant by the sentence.  You will not understand until you read Calculus Made Easy.</p>
<p>This is another book that just makes me sad at the current state of education.  Calculus is one of those things that's feared by the general public.  It's feared because it's misunderstood.  Calculus isn't hard.  And I don't mean to just sound like a jerk when I say that.  It isn't meant to be hard at least.  As the opening proverb of Calculus Made Easy says:
</p>
<blockquote>What one fool can do, another can.</blockquote>
All it really takes to understand calculus is the ability to imagine a very little bit of something.  That and a caring and skilled tutor to lead you on your way.  What name can you think of that sounds more caring and skillful than Silvanus Phillips Thompson.  
<p>I can think of no legitimate reason this book isn't used in each and every high school calculus in America.  Seriously.</p>

I was rather proud of my last post about being <a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/09/caught-in-rain.html">caught in the
rain</a>. In
that post, I concluded that you were better off running in the rain, but
that the net effect wasn't incredibly great. However, when I told people
about it, the question I inevitably got asked was: What if the rain
isn't vertical? That's what I'd like to look at today, and it turns out
to be a much more challenging question. I'm still going to assume that
the rain is falling at a constant rate. Furthermore, I'm going to assume
that the angle of the rain doesn't change. With those two assumptions
stated, let me remind you of the definitions we used last time. $$\rho
- \text{the density of water in the air in liters per cubic meter}$$
$$A_t - \text{top area of a person}$$ $$\Delta t - \text{time
elapsed}$$ $$d - \text{distance we have to travel in the rain}$$ $$v_r
- \text{raindrop velocity}$$ $$A_f - \text{front area of a person}$$
$$W_{tot} - \text{total amount of water in liters we get hit with}$$
As a reminder, our result from last time was: $$W_{tot}= \rho d (A_t
\frac{v_r}{v} + A_f)$$ Now, let's look at the new analysis. As
before, let us consider the stationary state first. Our velocity now has
two components, horizontal and vertical. Analogous to the purely
vertical situation, we can write down the stationary state, but now we
have rain hitting both our top and front (or back). I'm going to define
the angle, theta, as the angle the rain makes with the vertical (check
out figure 1 below). this gives $$W = \rho d A_t v_r \cos(\theta)
\Delta t+\rho A_f v_r \sin(\theta) \Delta t$$ Let's check our
limits. As theta goes to zero (vertical rain), we only get rain on top
of us, and as theta goes to 90 (horizontal rain), we only get rain on
the front of us. Makes sense! Alright, so let's add in the effect of
motion now. This is going to be more challenging than in the vertical
rain situation. We're going to examine two separate cases</p>

  Fig. 1 - The rain, and our angle.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Case 1: Running Against The Rain</strong> This is the easier of the two
cases. After thinking about it for a while, I believe that it is the
same as when the rain is vertical. Let me explain why. If you are moving
with some velocity v, in a time t you will cover a distance x=v<em>t. Now,
suppose we paused the rain, so it is no longer moving, then moved you a
distance x, turned the rain back on, and had you wait for a time t. And
repeated this over and over until you got to where you were going. This
would result in an </em>average<em> velocity equal to v, even though it is not
a smooth motion. However, my claim is that in the limit that t and x go
to zero, this is a productive way of considering our situation. We note
that v=x/t, and in the limit that both x and t go to zero, that is the
</em>definition* of instantaneous velocity. The recap is, that my 'pausing
the rain' scheme of thinking about things is fine, as long as we
consider moving ourselves only very small distances over very short
times. Using this construction, we have an additional amount of rain
absorbed by moving the distance delta x of:
$$ \Delta W = \rho A_f \Delta x $$
$$ \Delta W = \rho A_f v \Delta t $$
This gives a net expression of
$$\Delta W = \rho A_t v_r \cos(\theta) \Delta t+\rho A_f v_r
\sin(\theta) \Delta t+\rho A_f v \Delta t $$
$$\Delta W = \rho A_f v \Delta t \left( \left(
\frac{A_t}{A_f}\right)
\left(\frac{v_r}{v}\right)\cos(\theta)+\left(\frac{v_r}{v}\right)\sin(\theta)
+ 1 \right)$$
As before, turning the deltas into differentials and integrating yields
$$W = \rho A_f v t \left( \left( \frac{A_t}{A_f} \right)
\left(\frac{v_r}{v}\right)\cos(\theta)+\left(\frac{v_r}{v}\right)\sin(\theta)
+ 1\right)$$
$$W=\rho A_f d \left( \left( \frac{A_t}{A_f}\right)
\left(\frac{v_r}{v}\right)\cos(\theta)+
\left(\frac{v_r}{v}\right)\sin(\theta) + 1 \right)$$
Note that when theta is zero, our vertical rain result gives the same
thing as we found in the last post (the first term lives, the second
term goes to zero, the third term lives). I'm going to use the
reasonable numbers I came up with in the last post. However, since we
have wind, we'll have to modify our rain velocity. More specifically,
we'll assume the rain has the same vertical component of velocity in all
cases. Then the wind speed, v_w, will be what controls the angle. More
exactly, the magnitude of the raindrop velocity will be
$$v_r=\sqrt{(6 m/s)^2+v_w^2}$$
While the angle will be
$$\theta=\tan^{-1}(v_w/ (6 m/s))$$
Next we note that
$$v_r\cos\theta = 6 m/s$$
which is just the vertical component of our rain. Similarly, the other
term is just the horizontal component of our rain. So we can write our
as a function of our velocity and the wind speed (the angle and wind
speed is interchangeable):
$$W = \rho A_f d\left( \left( \frac{A_t}{A_f}\right)
\left(\frac{6 m/s}{v}\right) +\left(\frac{v_w}{v}\right) +
1\right)$$
Using the reasonable numbers I came up with in my last post yields (with
a distance of 100m)
$$W = .2 liters \left( \left(\frac{.72
m/s}{v}\right)&amp;+\left(\frac{v_w}{v}\right) + 1\right)$$
Once again, we have a least wet asymptote, which is the same as before.
I've plotted this function for various values of theta, and, more
intuitively, for various wind speeds (measured in mph, as we're used to
here in the US), and the plots are shown below (click to enlarge).
Unsurprisingly, you get the most wet when the rain is near horizontal,
but interestingly enough you can get the most percentage change from a
walk to a run when the rain is near horizontal. All angles are in
degrees.</p>

  Fig. 3 - How wet you get vs. how fast you run for various wind speeds in mph.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Case 2: Running With The Rain</strong>
This is the potentially harder case. We've got two obvious limiting
cases. If you run with the exact velocity of the rain and the rain is
horizontal, you shouldn't get wet. If the rain is vertical, it should
reduce to the result from my first post. We'll start with the stationary
case. This should be identical to case 1, if you're stationary it
doesn't matter if the rain is blowing on your front or back. That means
that for v=0, we should have $$\Delta W = \rho A_t v_r
\cos(\theta) \Delta t + \rho A_f v_r \sin(\theta) \Delta t$$
Now, let's use the same method as before, pausing the rain, advancing in
x, then letting time run. First we'll deal with our front side. Consider
figure 4.</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_SYZpxZOlcb0/TLIDC2OwATI/AAAAAAAAADc/TfIMFDmOl7Y/s1600/CITR+II+-+with1.jpg"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_SYZpxZOlcb0/TLIDC2OwATI/AAAAAAAAADc/TfIMFDmOl7Y/s320/CITR+II+-+with1.jpg"></a>
  Fig. 4 - Geometry for small delta x.</p>
<hr>
<p>Note that in front of us there is a rainless area, which we'll be
advancing into. Consider a delta x less than the length of the base of
that triangle. If we advance that delta x, we'll carve out a triangle of
rain as indicated, which, by some simple geometry, contains an amount of
rain $$\rho w \frac{(\Delta x)^2}{2 \tan(\theta)} = \rho w
\frac{v^2 (\Delta t)^2}{2 \tan(\theta)}$$ where w is the width of
our front. Now, consider if delta x is longer than the base of the
rainless triangle, as shown in figure 5.</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_SYZpxZOlcb0/TLID3V-ITNI/AAAAAAAAADg/V2oek4ZMsC4/s1600/CITR+II+-+with2.jpg"><img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_SYZpxZOlcb0/TLID3V-ITNI/AAAAAAAAADg/V2oek4ZMsC4/s320/CITR+II+-+with2.jpg"></a>
  Fig. 5 - Geometry for large delta x.</p>
<hr>
<p>We'll carve out an amount of rain equal to the indicated triangle plus
the rectangle. From the diagram we see this gives an amount of water
$$A_f \rho (\Delta x - h \tan(\theta)) + A_f \rho h
\tan(\theta)/2 = A_f \rho (\Delta x - \frac{h
\tan(\theta)}{2})$$ We could write two separate equations for these
two cases, but that's rather inefficient notation. I'm going to use the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaviside_step_function">Heaviside step
function</a>, H(x).
This is a function that is zero whenever the argument is negative, and 1
whenever the argument is positive. That means that for our front side,
$$\Delta W_f=\rho w \frac{v^2 (\Delta t)^2}{2 \tan(\theta)} H(
h\tan(\theta) - \Delta x) $$ $$+A_f \rho \left(\Delta x -
\frac{h \tan(\theta)}{2}\right)H(\Delta x - h \tan(\theta))$$
Note that I've written my step function in terms of the relative length
of delta x and the base of the rainless triangle. We get the first term
when delta x is less than the base length, and the second term when
delta x is more than the base length. Now, let us consider the rain
hitting our back. There are two cases here as well. First consider the
case where we're running with a velocity less than that of the rain. See
figure 6..</p>

  Fig. 6 - The back.</p>
<hr>
<p>We get two terms. There's the triangle of rain that moves down and hits
our back, shown above. Hopefully it is apparent that this is the same as
the triangle of rain we carved out with our front, and so will
contribute a volume of water $$\rho w \frac{v^2 (\Delta t)^2}{2
\tan(\theta)}$$ There's also the rain that manages to catch up with
us, $$A_f \rho (v_r \sin(\theta) \Delta t - \Delta x) =A_f \rho
\Delta t (v_r \sin(\theta) - v)$$ In the case where we outrun the
rain, we don't want this term, and our triangle gains a maximal length
of the horizontal and vertical components of the rain velocity times
delta t. We can write this backside term using a step function as
$$\Delta W_b =A_f \rho \Delta t \left(v_r \sin(\theta) - v +w
\frac{v^2 (\Delta t)^2}{2 \tan(\theta)}\right)H( v_r
\sin(\theta) - v)$$ $$+\rho w v_r^2 \Delta t^2
\frac{\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)}{2} H(v-v_r\sin(\theta))$$ We can
combine these terms, with our usual top term, to get $$\Delta W =A_f
\rho \Delta t \left[ \left(v_r \sin(\theta) - v +\frac{w}{A_f}
\frac{v^2 (\Delta t)}{2 \tan(\theta)}\right)H(v_r \sin(\theta)
- v)$$ $$+ \frac{w}{A_f} v_r^2 \Delta t
\frac{\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)}{2} H(v-v_r\sin(\theta) $$ $$+
\frac{w}{A_f} \frac{v^2 (\Delta t)}{2 \tan(\theta)} H(
h\tan(\theta) - \Delta x)$$ $$+\left(\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} -
\frac{h \tan(\theta)}{2 \Delta t}\right)H(\Delta x - h
\tan(\theta))+\frac{A_t}{A_f} v_r \cos(\theta) ] $$ I'm sure
this four line equation looks intimidating (I'm also sure that it is the
longest equation we've written here on the virtuosi!). But it'll
simplify when we take our limit as delta t goes to zero. Let's do this a
little more carefully than usual. $$\lim_{\Delta t \to
0}\frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t} =\lim_{\Delta t \to 0}A_f \rho
\left[ \left(v_r \sin(\theta) - v +\frac{w}{A_f} \frac{v^2
(\Delta t)}{2 \tan(\theta)}\right)$$ $$*H(v_r \sin(\theta) - v)+
\frac{w}{A_f} v_r^2 \Delta t
\frac{\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)}{2} H(v-v_r\sin(\theta) $$ $$+
\frac{w}{A_f} \frac{v^2 (\Delta t)}{2 \tan(\theta)} H(
h\tan(\theta) - v \Delta t)$$ $$+\left(v - \frac{h
\tan(\theta)}{2 \Delta t}\right)H(v \Delta t - h
\tan(\theta))+\frac{A_t}{A_f} v_r \cos(\theta) ] $$ We'll take
this term by term. On the left side of our equality, we recognize the
definition of a differential of W with respect to t. Any term on the
right without a delta t we can ignore. The first term with a delta t is
$$\frac{w}{A_f} \frac{v^2 (\Delta t)}{2 \tan(\theta)}H(v_r
\sin(\theta) - v)$$ In all cases except when theta = 0, this term goes
to zero. Now, when theta = 0, tan(theta) = 0, so our limit gives zero
over zero, which is a number (note, I'm not being extremely careful. If
you'd like, tangent goes as the argument to leading order, so we have
two things going to zero linearly, hence getting a number back out).
However, looking at the step function, when theta goes to zero, we
likewise require v to be zero to get a value. However, our term goes as
v^2, so we conclude that in our limit, this term goes to zero. Next we
have $$\frac{w}{A_f} v_r^2 \Delta t
\frac{\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)}{2} H(v-v_r\sin(\theta)$$ This
obviously goes to zero, no mitigating circumstances like a division by
zero. The next term is $$\frac{w}{A_f} \frac{v^2 (\Delta t)}{2
\tan(\theta)} H( h\tan(\theta) - v \Delta t)$$ This term presents
the same theta = 0 issues as the first term. The resolution is slightly
more subtle and less mathematical than before. Remember that this term
physically represents the rain that hits us when we move forward through
the section that our body hasn't shielded from the rain (see the drawing
above). I argue from a physical standpoint that when the rain is
vertical, this term would double count the rain we absorb with the next
term (which doesn't go to zero). I'm going to send this term to zero on
physical principles, even though the mathematics are not explicit about
what should happen. Next we have $$vH(v \Delta t - h \tan(\theta))$$
The argument of the step function makes it clear that to have any chance
at a non-zero value we need theta = 0. The mathematics isn't completely
clear here, as the value of a step function at zero is usually a matter
of convention (typically .5). Let's think physically about what this
term represents. This is the rain we absorb beyond the shielded region
(see above figure). This is the term I said the previous term would
double count with when the rain is vertical, so we're required to keep
it. However, only when theta = 0. I'm going to use another special
function to write that mathematically, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronecker_delta">Kronecker
delta</a>, which is 1 when
the subscript is zero, and zero otherwise. This is a bit of an odd use
of the Kronecker delta, because it's typically only used for integers,
but for those purists out there, there is an integral definition which
has the same properties for any (non-integer) value. Thus $$vH(v \Delta
t - h \tan(\theta))=v\delta_{\theta}$$ The last term we have to
concern ourselves with is $$- \frac{h \tan(\theta)}{2 \Delta t}H(v
\Delta t - h \tan(\theta))$$ Again, there is some mathematical
confusion when theta = 0, so we think physically again. This term
represents the rain in the unblocked triangle (see above). Obviously,
there is no rain in the triangle when theta is zero, because there is no
triangle! We set this term to zero as well. This gives us a much simler
expression than before,
$$\frac{dW}{dt} =A_f \rho \left[ (v_r \sin(\theta) - v)H(v_r
\sin(\theta) - v)+v\delta_{\theta}+\frac{A_t}{A_f} v_r
\cos(\theta) \right]$$
We can pull out a v and integrate with respect to t, giving
$$W=A_f \rho v t \left[ (\frac{v_r \sin(\theta)}{v} - 1)H(v_r
\sin(\theta) - v)+\delta_{\theta}+\frac{A_t}{A_f} \frac{v_r
\cos(\theta)}{v} \right]$$
As before, we can write this in terms of the wind velocity and the
vertical rain velocity,
$$W=A_f \rho d \left[ (\frac{v_w}{v} - 1)H(v_w -
v)+\delta_{v_w}+\frac{A_t}{A_f} \frac{v_{r,vert}}{v} \right]$$
This is a nice, simple expression that we can easily plot. There is one
thing that bothers me, I feel like there should be another step function
term that kicks in when your velocity exceeds the horizontal rain
velocity, and you start getting more rain on your front. But I'm going
to trust my analysis, and assert that such a term would be at least
second order in our work. If someone does find it, let me know! Using
the reasonable numbers from my last post gives $$W=.2 liters \left[
(\frac{v_w}{v} - 1)H(v_w - v)+\delta_{v_w}+\frac{.72 m/s}{v}
\right]$$ Because this post is long enough already, I've gone ahead and
plotted this only vs. wind velocity. I've also plotted the former least
wet asymptote. Most interesting (and you'll probably have to click on
the graph to enlarge to see this) is that there no longer is a least wet
asymptote! In theory if you run fast enough you can stay as dry as you
want.</p>

<p><strong>Comparison</strong>
I will conclude with a comparison of the two results, to each other and
to the vertical case. First, lets take the appropriate limits.
$$W_{with}=A_f \rho d \left[ (\frac{v_w}{v} - 1)H(v_w -
v)+\delta_{v_w}+\frac{A_t}{A_f} \frac{v_{r,vert}}{v} \right]$$
$$W_{against} = \rho A_f d\left( \left( \frac{A_t}{A_f}\right)
\left(\frac{v_{r,vert}}{v}\right) +\left(\frac{v_w}{v}\right) +
1\right)$$
$$W_{stationary} = \rho t A_f \left(\frac{A_t}{A_f}
v_{r,vert}+v_w\right)$$
$$W_{vert}= \rho d A_f \left(\frac{A_t}{A_f} \frac{v_r}{v} + 1
\right)$$
In the stationary limit, we have to break up the d in our equations into
v t, and that gives
$$\lim_{v \to 0}W_{with}= \lim_{v \to 0} W_{against}=\rho t
A_f \left(\frac{A_t}{A_f} v_{r_vert}+v_w\right)$$
While in the vertical rain limit
$$\lim_{v_w \to 0}W_{with}= \lim_{v_w \to 0} W_{against}
=\rho d A_f \left(\frac{A_t}{A_f} \frac{v_r}{v} + 1 \right)$$
So our limits work. Finally, it's a little hard to tell the difference
between the forward and backwards case, so I've plotted the two lines
together for a few values of v_w. You'll notice that for zero wind
speed they have the same result (which is good, since our limit was the
same), but for the other wind speeds they are remarkably divergent, more
so as you run faster! (again, click to enlarge)</p>

<p><strong>Conclusions</strong>
Hopefully this has been an interesting exercise for you. I know it
certainly took me longer to work and write than I initially thought.
While you can't see it in the post, there were a lot of scribblings and
thinking going on before I came to these conclusions. Most of it went
something like: "No, that can't be right, it doesn't have the right
(zero velocity/zero angle) limit!". I think this concludes all of the
running in the rain that I want to do, but if you have more followup
questions, post them below, and I'll do my best to answer. Also, I admit
that my analysis may be a bit rough, so if you have other approaches,
let me know. Finally, note that everything I've found favors running in
the rain, so get yourself some exercise and stay dry!</p>

  The bearded half of Hulse-Taylor</p>
<hr>
<p>A few weeks ago I was on a bus going through Scranton and I read a
super-awesome fun fact regarding the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar in
<em>Black Holes, White Dwarfs and Neutron Stars</em>. Sadly, I have since
forgotten it and left the book a few thousand miles away. So, let's just
make up our own! First, we need a little background. What the heck is a
pulsar? A pulsar is a rapidly rotating neutron star that beams
electromagnetic radiation towards us, which is how we can see them.
Typical rotation periods range from a millisecond to a few seconds. So
each time the pulsar rotates, we observe a blip when the radiation beams
towards us. Since these objects are additionally very stable rotators,
they are essentially very accurate clocks with which we may make
astronomical measurements. So what's the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar? The
Hulse-Taylor binary is almost exactly what it sounds like: it's a pulsar
binary where one of the pulsars is pointed towards earth. It was the
first binary of it's kind discovered and offers a unique look into a
very high gravity environment. It also provided a very nice test for
General Relativity. General Relativity predicts that two orbiting
massive bodies should emit gravitational waves. This emission of
gravitational waves will then cause the orbit to decay and the two
bodies to move closer together. So does the Hulse-Taylor binary show
this? Take a look:
<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TKF5SwXxsXI/AAAAAAAAAHI/wPELMEGlWW0/s1600/PSR_1913_new_large.jpg"><img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TKF5SwXxsXI/AAAAAAAAAHI/wPELMEGlWW0/s400/PSR_1913_new_large.jpg"></a>The
data fit the prediction of general relativity perfectly! For this
discovery Hulse and Taylor shared the 1993 Nobel prize in Physics. Now
that's all well and good, but I was promised some fun facts...? Ah, yes!
Well, we mentioned that the Hulse-Taylor binary orbit is decaying. It
turns out that the orbit is decaying at about 3.5 meters per year.
That's pretty slow. Let's put it into a more conventional speed, like
meters per second. So $$ 3.5 m/yr = 3.5 m/yr \times \frac{1 year}{3.14
\times 10^7 s} = 1.1 \times 10^{-7} m/s $$ or, in less useful units,
$$ 3.5 m/yr = 110 nm/s $$ Great, so what to compare this to? Well, all
people who are in the know know that I am a manly man who gained the
ability to grow facial hair sometime after my sophomore year of college.
And since I have to pretend to be an upstanding member of society this
week, I happen to know the last time I shaved. Thus, a few simple
measurements and I can estimate how long hair takes to grow. The last
time I shaved was three days ago and a quick eyeball measurement (sadly
I have no ruler) gives a facial hair length of about 2mm. Thus, a beard
grows at about 0.7 mm/ day. $$ 0.7 mm/day = 0.7 mm/day \times
\frac{10^{-3} m}{mm} \times \frac{1 day}{86400s} = 8 nm/s $$ This is
a universal speed constant, which we shall call the speed of beard. Or,
bowing to our oppressive overload sponsors<em>, we shall call it "Gillette
Mach 1." So doing a quick division, we find that the rate at which the
Hulse-Taylor binary's orbit is shrinking is roughly 14 times beard
speed, or in our commercial units, Gillette Mach 14 (a razor close
shave!). "Well," I hear you cry (a bit disappointed...?), "that's </em><em>a
</em>pretty<em> useless unit, but can't we be </em>more<em> useless?" Yes, dear
reader, we certainly can! We are currently at
</em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xZp-GLMMJ0">Snuggie</a><em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ym65h1bmJ0"></a>levels
of uselessness right now, but I think we can just about bump it up to
</em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ONJfp95yoE">Member of Congress</a>*
useless if we try. A furlong is a unit of length about 200 meters long.
A fortnight is a unit of time about 14 days long. Therefore, if we want
a speed we just... $$ \frac{furlong}{fortnight} = 1
\frac{furlong}{fortnight} \times \frac{200 m}{furlong} \times
\frac{1 fortnight}{14 \times 86400 s} = 1.6 \times 10^{-4}
\frac{m}{s} $$
So the rate of decay of the Hulse-Taylor binary is:
$$ 3.5 \frac{m}{yr} = 1.1 \times 10^{-7} m/s \times \frac{1
furlong/fortnight}{ 1.6 \times 10^{-4} m/s} = 7 \times 10^{-4}
\frac{furlong}{fortnight} $$ Hooray! So now we know the decay rate of
the Hulse-Taylor binary orbit in two horrible units: either 700
microfurlongs per fortnight or 14 times the speed of beard (AKA Gillette
Mach 14). Please write these in your copybooks now and forever commit
them to memory. * In no way is The Virtuosi affiliated with the
wonderful Gillette Company, which makes the world's best razors. Since
we aren't affiliated with this great Gillette company, we are not
obligated to repeat their slogan that it's "The Best A Man Can Get"
despite its self-evident truth. Nor is the author required to say that
the silky smooth shave I get with a Mach 20 razor is the only reason I
can even must social interaction. Hooray!</p>

<p>Last time, I presented reasons why it would be economically infeasible
for the US to switch to the metric system. This time, I'd like to talk
about a change that could relatively easily be brought about soon. A
change that would barely cost a thing, but could improve efficiency
dramatically in many jobs and in every day life for many people. A
change of this type would be very handy. Puns aside though, what I'm
talking about is this: DVORAK SIMPLIFIED KEYBOARD (again lots from
Wikipedia)
<a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/KB_United_States_Dvorak.svg/500px-KB_United_States_Dvorak.svg.png"><img alt="image" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/KB_United_States_Dvorak.svg/500px-KB_United_States_Dvorak.svg.png"></a><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/KB_United_States_Dvorak.svg/1000px-KB_United_States_Dvorak.svg.png"></a>

<a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/KB_United_States_Dvorak.svg/1000px-KB_United_States_Dvorak.svg.png"></a>
Look down at your keyboard. Chances are very good that if you bought
your keyboard in an English speaking country, you're using the QWERTY
keyboard layout. You'll also probably know (or else you'll learn from
me) that the letter "E" is the most common in the English language. You
might wonder then, why it's not in the "home row" (the row of keys in
the middle of the keyboard that would be right under your fingers if
you're typing in the standard way). You might also wonder why other
common letters like "T" were exiled to the top row while less common
letters like "J" and "K" sit right under your fingertips as they rest
idle. You may then think about how slow it is to type words like
"December" which require you to use the same finger for consecutive
letters. You may even get to thinking that a lot of words require using
the same hand for consecutive letters, but it would be much nicer to
alternate hands as you type. The reasons for the slow speed of QWERTY
are not entirely clear. There are stories floating around about the
inventor of the typewriter deliberately laying out the keyboard this way
to keep typing speeds down so that the mechanical keys wouldn't jam. The
authenticity of these stories are disputed, but you'd be hard pressed to
argue that QWERTY is the most efficient layout there could be. One
competitor for the title that has stood out is called Dvorak, named
after its creator. Some statistics from Wikipedia (sources given there):</p>
<ul>
<li>"the Dvorak layout uses about 63% of the finger motion required by
    QWERTY"</li>
<li>"the vast majority of the Dvorak layout's key strokes (70%) are done
    in the home row" whereas QWERTY "has only 32% of the strokes done in
    the home row"</li>
<li>"The QWERTY layout has more than 3,000 words that are typed on the
    left hand alone and about 300 words that are typed on the right hand
    alone", but "with the Dvorak layout, only a few words can be typed
    on the left hand and not one syllable can be typed with the right
    hand alone, much less a word."</li>
<li>"On QWERTY keyboards, 56% of the typing strokes are done by the left
    hand. As the left hand is weaker for the majority of people, the
    Dvorak keyboard puts the more often used keys on the right hand
    side, thereby having 56% of the typing strokes done by the right
    hand."</li>
<li>"Because the Dvorak layout requires less finger motion from the
    typist compared to QWERTY, many users with repetitive strain
    injuries have reported that switching from QWERTY to Dvorak
    alleviated or even eliminated their repetitive strain injury."</li>
<li>"The fastest English language typist in the world, according to The
    Guinness Book of World Records" achieved "a peak speed of 212 wpm"
    using Dvorak</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, so maybe by now you see that Dvorak can be more efficient. So why
hasn't it been implemented yet? Well, back in the typewriter era, it was
one layout or the other, and people picked QWERTY. Look at Wikipedia for
a summary. But now, assuming you're not using a typewriter or a 386 or
something equivalently ancient, it's actually quite easy to switch back
and forth between QWERTY and Dvorak. Check out your control panel if
you're on a PC (or the equivalent on a mac or linux or what have you)
and I bet you'll find the setting for changing the keyboard layout
pretty easily, and I bet that Dvorak will be one of the layouts you can
choose. So it's easy enough to switch all the devices to the new system,
with pretty much no cost. The problem is of course that hardly anybody
can type with Dvorak. Everybody is used to QWERTY! And I'm sure there
are people out there who are happy to try to learn Dvorak, but I'm not
one of them. I'm used to QWERTY and I'm pretty sure if I tried to
switch, I'd get confused and completely jumble the two systems. I just
can't see the slight increase in my typing speed being worth the hassle.
Maybe some can, but I'm sure that many feel the same way I do,
especially those who, like me, don't do a lot of transcribing or the
like, and so rarely need to type very fast. The key? (sorry, no more
puns, I promise) Get 'em while they're young. That's right, all the
young typists out there can be trained on Dvorak instead of QWERTY. If
they never learn QWERTY, they'll never be confused. And they can use the
same keyboards as everyone else. All that we'd have to do is make it
easier to switch the keyboard layout (put something a little closer than
the control panel, maybe right on the keyboard), and print two sets of
characters on the keyboard when they are made (note that I've neglected
cell phones and other devices that also have keyboards, but they can be
updated in the same way). It would be as easy as that to implement the
change. Give it maybe 5-10 years to phase in keyboards and operating
systems with the easy-switch built in (in this case, it's nice that
computers have such short life spans), then have schools start teaching
kids to use Dvorak in typing classes. In a generation, hardly anyone
will even remember QWERTY except as a weird hiccup along the way to
efficiency.</p>

    <p>When I walked into my first day of physics class in high school, I
carried with me a set of ideas which I learned from simply observing and
interacting with the world. In fact everyone builds up what they believe
to be intuitive concepts, whether it be in science, math, or any other
field. Without any scientific training whatsoever, we begin to build
intuition. If you let go of a ball in the air, what will happen? If you
try to run on the ice of a frozen lake, will it be easier than running
on the sidewalk? If you stand in the sun and on the ground you see a
strange dark misshapen copy of yourself imitating your every move... who
is following you? Unfortunately we run into an issue when our intuition
disagrees with experimental results or someone elseâs intuition. At that
point, it is essential to break down and analyze our intuition to find
where any problems in our logic may exist. This process of continually
breaking down and analyzing intuition is key to progressing in science.
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_CPJjnXOJ-mQ/TJZ5DVIGsPI/AAAAAAAAABU/-22lS-Cq6_U/s1600/ThreeDice.jpg"><img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_CPJjnXOJ-mQ/TJZ5DVIGsPI/AAAAAAAAABU/-22lS-Cq6_U/s320/ThreeDice.jpg"></a>Let's
take a look at a simple dice game. The rules of the game dictate that
you pick a die first, then I pick a die, then we roll together 100 times
(weâre really bored, apparently). The winner is the person who rolls a
higher number more times in 100 rolls. The catch is that the numbers are
not the standard 1-6 on each die, but a magic set of numbers which may
repeat any number from 1-6 as many times as desired, for example {1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 5}. "Sounds easy," you say, as you pick up the yellow die. I
choose blue. We roll, and I win 74 out of 100 times. "Obviously the blue
die is better, give me that one," you say. I proceed to pick up the
green die, lo and behold, I win 63 out of 100 times. "Okay okay, I've
got the hang of it now. Clearly the green die is better than all of the
rest." I choose the yellow die and win 65 out of 100 times. In a fit of
rage you proclaim "witchcraft" and storm off for your witch-hunt gear.
There is no deception here with the exception of logic, the younger
sister of witchcraft. It is actually an interesting challenge to try to
come up with a set of numbers which will yield the following result: The
probability of the value on the blue die being higher than the value on
the yellow die is greater than 1/2. The probability of the value on the
green die being higher than the value on the blue die is greater than
1/2. The probability of the value on the yellow die being higher than
the value on the green die is greater than 1/2. There are definitely a
multitude of possible solutions, so I encourage you to attempt to find
one using only numbers 1-6 before scrolling down. Got a solution? Let's
take a look at the following dice: Yellow : {1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4} Blue :
{2, 2, 2, 5, 5, 5} Green : {3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6} I should note that my
solution is set up to have no ties, which makes the analysis a bit more
straightforward. It is certainly possible to come up with interesting
solutions which allow ties.
<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_CPJjnXOJ-mQ/TJZ436UNErI/AAAAAAAAABM/m-BpJNofQFk/s1600/Screen+shot+2010-09-19+at+4.10.27+PM.png"><img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_CPJjnXOJ-mQ/TJZ436UNErI/AAAAAAAAABM/m-BpJNofQFk/s320/Screen+shot+2010-09-19+at+4.10.27+PM.png"></a>The
chart on the right shows how each die compares to the others. The color
of each square indicates the winner when the number of the same row and
column are compared. We can see that blue beats yellow 21 out of 36
times, green beats blue 21 out of 36 times, and yellow beats green 25
out of 36 times. So this combination of dice will show the
non-transitive effect we were looking for. So I explain this âsorceryâ
to you, before you try to burn me at the stake for being a witch, and
you calm down. Now I tell you that Iâd like to try a new game. I select
two dice of the same color, then you get to select two dice of the same
color, then we roll both pairs 100 times. The winner this time is the
person who rolls a higher total, the sum of their two dice, more times
in 100 rolls. I select two yellow dice. After learning of my trick, you
decide to pick two blues and proceed to lose 60 out of 100 times. You
declare, ââtis but a statistical error, letâs have another go!â I select
two blues and you, two greens. I win again! Just to rub it in, I choose
green and you choose yellow, and I win once again. Softly weeping, you
listen as I explain that the probabilities have now switched! The chart
on the right shows the different sums that are possible for a given set
of colored dice. When you
look<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_CPJjnXOJ-mQ/TJZ4wlSQh4I/AAAAAAAAAA0/p69QSdtqFdc/s1600/Screen+shot+2010-09-19+at+4.10.38+PM.png"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_CPJjnXOJ-mQ/TJZ4wlSQh4I/AAAAAAAAAA0/p69QSdtqFdc/s320/Screen+shot+2010-09-19+at+4.10.38+PM.png"></a>
at the possible sum 4 for the blue dice, you see that 4 can meet up with
2 a total of nine times, with blue winning each, 4 can meet up with 5 a
total of 90 times with yellow winning each, and can meet up with 8 a
total of 225 times with yellow winning each. So the value in each cell
is the number of times each match-up can occur, with the color of the
cell showing who will win each match-up. There are 6^4 = 1296
possibilities, so winning half corresponds to 648. This dice trick is an
example of non-transitive logic, which can certainly be a non-intuitive
topic (Stay tuned for some non-transitive logic involving coins!). In
this case, you must break your intuition that there must be one âbestâ
die. In science, itâs a great idea to try to look for other examples of
the behavior you are observing to help reinforce what youâve learned. It
turns out that one of the most basic schoolyard games involves
non-transitive logic! In the game of rock, paper, scissors, we find that
rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock. This
is analogous to the behavior of our special dice, and I believe makes
the logic much easier to understand. Compare against your intuition,
break down and analyze, build up and reinforce.</p>

<p>Or how I learned to stop worrying and love the computer. [Note: There's
a neat video below the fold. ]</p>
<h4>A Confession</h4>
<p>I was recently rereading the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=_6XvAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Feynman+lectures+on+physics&amp;dq=Feynman+lectures+on+physics&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6wmQTPzsDIG78gbAp_joDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ">Feynman Lectures on
Physics</a>.
If you haven't read them lately, I highly recommend them. Feynman is
always a pleasure to read. As usual, I was surprised. This time the
surprise came in lecture 9, which the way the course was laid out meant
that this was something like the last lecture in the third week that
these students had ever received of university level physics. The
lecture is on Newton's laws of dynamics. The start is of course Newton's
<del>first</del> (second) law, $$ F = \frac{d }{dt } (mv ) $$ which, provided
the mass is constant takes the more familiar form $$ F = ma $$ After
discussing the meaning of the equation and how in general it can give
you a set of equations to solve, he naturally uses an example to
illustrate the kinds of problems you can solve. What system does he
choose to use as the first illustration of a dynamical system? The Solar
System. That's right. Let that settle for a second. The sad thing is
that if you caught me off guard before I read the lecture, caught me in
an honest moment and asked me how you would solve the solar system, I
would probably have launched into a discussion of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_problem">N-body
problem</a> and how there is
no closed form solution to newtonian gravity that involves 3 or more
bodies. (Depending on who you are, I might have then mentioned the
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1991CeMDA..50...73W">recent caveat</a>,
namely that there is a closed form solution to the N-body problem, but
that it involves a very very very slowly convergent series). Now, how
can Feynman use the Solar System as his first example of solving
Newtonian dynamics and I have told you that it's impossible as my first
words on the subject? Well, the answer of course is that Feynman was
much smarter than I am. Perhaps another way to say it is that in a lot
of ways Feynman was a more contemporary physicist than I am.</p>
<h4>A Realization</h4>
<p>Physics education has changed very little in the last 50 years or so.
Now in some ways this isn't a problem. The laws of nature also haven't
changed in the last 50 years. What's unfortunate is that the tools
available to physicists to answer their questions have changed
remarkably. Namely, computers. Computers are great. They permeate daily
life nowadays. They are capable of performing millions of computations
per second. This is great for physics. You see, a lot of the time, as
you all know, the way you achieve answers to specific questions about
the evolution of a system is to do a lot of computation. So what did
physicists do before computers? Well, a lot of time they would have to
do a lot of calculations out by hand, but no one enjoys that, so a lot
of times you would have to make sacrifices, make assumptions that meant
that your analytical investigations were simple enough to yield tiddy
little equations. This is reflected in the kinds of problems we still
solve in our physics classes. I never solved the solar system in my
mechanics class. I never did it because there isn't a closed form
analytical solution to the solar system. But you know what... that
doesn't matter. It doesn't matter in the least. Because while there
doesn't exist a closed form solution to the problem, it is very easy to
come up with a numerical approximation scheme (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method">Euler
Method</a>). You see, the point
of physics is to get answers to questions. And the fact of the matter is
that those answers don't have to be 'exact', they don't have to be
perfect. They need to be good enough that we can't tell the difference
between them being 'exact' and them being an approximation. To do this
numerically with a pad of paper and a pencil is a heroic task. Do do
this with a computer takes a couple of lines of python code and a couple
seconds.</p>
<h4>An example</h4>
<p>As an example of the neat things you can do with a few lines of python
code and a few minutes on your hand, check this out.

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idpQOJKOh6Y">there's</a>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9121zwpbBs">more</a> This video depicts
time dependent quantum mechanics. I set up a gaussian wavepacket, inside
of a potential that includes a hard wall on the sides and is
proportional to x. That sounds fancy but what it means is that this is
the quantum mechanics equivalent of a bouncing ball. The amplitude of
the wave function corresponds to the probability of finding the particle
at any location. That is, imagine picking one of the colored pixels at
random. If you pick any of the colored pixels at random, and look down
at the x position, that is what measuring the position of the particle
would do. But what are the colors? Quantum mechanical wave functions are
complex. This means you can represent them either with a real and
imaginary part, or with a magnitude and a phase. Here it's the latter.
Like I said the amplitude is shown with the height (actually the
amplitude squared). The color corresponds to the phase, where the phase
is mapped to a location on the color wheel, just like the one that pops
up in Photoshop or GIMP. And theres sound too! The sound is what the
wave function would sound like if it was making noise. Its the real part
of the wave function played as a sound. To that end, in this video it is
very low frequency, because I made the movie slow enough to see the
colors changing well. Its fun to watch the video and listen to the
sound. For this movie the sound correlates nicely to when the 'ball'
reaches its maximum height. Whats also cool is that you can hear the
'ball' delocalize after each bounce. The sound and function start off
being nice and sharp, but after a few bounces it starts to spread out.
You can also see how momentum is encoded in quantum mechanics. Funny
thing is that instead of being something separate that you need to
specify like in classical mechanics, in quantum mechanics the wave
function is a complete description of the evolution of the system. I.e.
if I showed you just one frame of this bouncing ball, you would be able
to recreate the entire movie. If I showed you just one frame of a
classical basketball, you'd have no idea what frame came next since
you'd only know its position, not its velocity. In quantum mechanics the
momentum gets encoded in the wave function, and as you can tell its
encoded as a complex twist. A phase gradient. A crazy rainbow. If you
look closely, you can even see that you can tell the difference between
whether the particle is falling left or right. When it goes left the
rainbow pattern goes (reading left to right) blue red green. When its
moving right it goes blue green red. It twists one way then the other in
the complex plane. The colors are a little hard to see in this one,
they're a little easier to see in this one: This second one I dressed up
a bit, labelling the axes with units, putting a time counter,
superimposing the potential I was talking about, and marking the average
expected position with a tracer black dot on the bottom.</p>
<h4>A Call to Arms</h4>
<p>Any student who has taken a first course in quantum mechanics knows
enough physics to make these movies. The physics isn't complicated. But
the movies really neat, right? More than neat. Making these videos
taught me things about quantum mechanics I should have learned a long
time ago. I really think computers are underestimated in physics
education. They can be a great tool. A picture is worth a thousand
words, so a movie must be worth millions<em>. </em>: denotes stolen quote
More than just as an illustrative tool, the fact that even students in
the first introductory mechanics physics course can solve for something
like the solar system shouldn't be hidden from them. Classical mechanics
after all is the physics of pretty much every object we can see and
touch, but classics mechanics classes only ever talk about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atwood_machine">Atwood
machines</a> and frictionless
planes. Often the closest they come to realism is in discussing
projectile motion, where the laws you learn in the book (neglecting air
resistance) are very good at describing the trajectories of very dense
large objects (i.e. cannonballs). I can't remember the last time I've
fired a cannon. But air resistance serves little trouble to my computer.
Or <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/tag/air-resistance/">Rhett's</a> (of
Dot Physics, which has just moved to Wired). Basically, if you give a
student an intro physics course and an intro programming course,
suddenly you have a human being who is better equipped to answer
questions about natural phenomenon than 99% of human beings that have
ever lived. So lets take a tip from Feynman and teach physics students
how to solve the solar system.</p>
<h4>Code</h4>
<p>As per request, here is the python code I used to generate the videos.
Its rather messy, so I apologize in advance.

- A general script which finds the eigenvalues and eigenbasis for a 1D
particle with an arbitrary potential.

- Code to generate the movie. You need to create a directory with the
same name as the name in the script in the save folder as the script.
The last two lines make the sound and the directory full of images. I
used ffmpeg to wrap the two together.</p>
