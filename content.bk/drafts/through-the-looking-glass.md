Now that the semester is over, I'd like to look back and
reflect on my first year teaching. I served as a TA both semesters this
year. First semester I taught Electricity and Magnetism plus
Thermodynamics for engineers, with two recitation sections twice a week,
and a lab section about once every other week. Second semester I taught
Electricity and Magnetism, but this time the honors class designed
primarily for prospective physics and applied physics majors. First a
little background so that you may interpret my comments how you please.
I went to public high school, my freshman year in Wisconsin, and the
rest in Orlando, Florida. I obtained my Bachelors of Science in physics
from Caltech.

### Some Problems

While teaching, I noticed some problems.

-   Too many digits in calculations.
-   A lack of common sense applied to numbers.
-   A disrespect for units.
-   A lack of confidence.
-   A distrust of approximation
-   False preconceptions of what physics is.

------------------ general thoughts Students don't know what physics is.
Come in with false expectations Books don't help. Physics is not
accounting. Sour points. Dimensional analysis. Common sense numbers.
Willingness to be wrong. Most often I wouldn't do anything for them.
They do not ask questions. W=Fd. Sig Figs. Suggestions: Be explicit
about assumptions, like Feynman. Give some real world numbers to ground
ideas of magnitude. Challenge students. Be less helpful. Things I did.
Power line transmission problem. Balloons from string problem. Little
motor problem. Difference between engineering physics and honors.
Difference between standard textbook and purcell. Find a good purcell
problem.
