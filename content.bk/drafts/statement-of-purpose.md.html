In England during the 17th century, a new group of thinkers emerged.  These "natural philosophers" took it upon themselves to ponder the workings of the world around them.  As more of these like-minded men emerged they formed a society, the Royal Society where they would meet periodically to discuss the work and questions that interested them.  These men went by the title of <span style="font-style:italic;">virtuosi</span> 
<blockquote>virtuoso <span style="font-style:italic;">noun plural</span> virtuosi
4. Obsolete. a person who has special interest or knowledge in the arts and sciences; scientist; scholar.

I aim that this group provide an outlet for inquisitive minds at Caltech to meet and discuss interesting problems, perhaps kooky, perhaps unsolved, perhaps just plain interesting.  Hopefully the meetings of the Virtuosi may serve as a forum for us all to better ourselves outside of our Sets and classes.

The way I imagine it:  we meet once a week and people suggest interesting problems.  Over the course of the next week, if members have time they will think about some of the problems posed.  At the following meeting we each share what we've come up with and critique/collaborate with each other.  

All interesting parties should shoot me an email, I envision the group being open to all interested.
