what is zero-g how is it attained with a plane video
possible flight paths try spherical -constant \\dot{\\theta}, start r
large, r changing to satisfy full energy equation ---limited by height
of plane possible ---turn space for plane at bottom of fall -high speed
low r, tilt up and start zero-g here ---limited by max linear speed of
plane ---turns space for plane at bottom of fall compare trajectories to
mgh parabolic
