So, some you may remember when I attempted to calculate how much the
oceans would lower if you took out all of the fish in an [earlier
post](http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/04/fishy-calculation.html).
Well, the results came in a while ago, but I forgot to mention that [I
lost](http://diaryofnumbers.blogspot.com/2010/05/we-have-winner.html)
the contest. I was about two orders of magnitude off from the winning
answer. In light of my failure, I'm going to try again in the [newest
contest](http://diaryofnumbers.blogspot.com/2010/05/hamster-powered-mansions.html).
This time the question is a bit stranger:

> How many buff hamsters would it take to completely power a mansion?

I encourage all of The Virtuosi readers to enter as well, it only takes
a minute to come up with some number. Good luck one and all.
