                    <p>Matt Springer over at <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/builtonfacts/">Built on
Fact</a>s has a <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/builtonfacts/2010/04/laser_rifle_recoil.php">very nice
post</a>
following up on my earlier analysis of <a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/04/today-id-like-to-approach-question-near.html">whether or not a laser gun would
recoil</a>.
In my analysis I came to the conclusion that the momentum delivered was
much less than that of a conventional gun, but that the impulse, and
hence the force delivered, was about the same. However, that force was
delivered over a \~30ns timescale, which left open the question of
whether or not the wielder would be able to feel that recoil. While I
had thought to possibly return to this issue at some point, Matt has
beat me to it. This is fortuitous, because I wasn't sure quite where to
start with the question, while he approaches it in a very sensible,
clear manner. The gist of his post is that he compares our response to
short time scale forces to our ability to sense sound. I won't go
through his calculations, you can check those out for yourself, but he
concludes that it is very unlikely that we could feel the recoil of our
laser gun. Case closed. Though, like any good scientist, we may choose
to reopen it later if more evidence comes to light.</p>

                    <p>When I walk in my door when I get home, I hook my keys, which I keep on
a carabiner, onto a binder clip that I've clipped onto my window sill.
Its a great way to never lose your keys. But one thing I always notice
is that when I hook it on, it swings, and every time it swings it makes
a click. This you might expect. What always surprises me is how long the
keys keep swinging. They seem to swing for a surprisingly long time,
minutes.
It always catches me off guard. In order to explain why, I get to talk
about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_factor">Q Factors</a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_factor"></a>
The Q factor stands for quality factor. Its a nondimensional parameter
(my favorite kind) that tells you how pure your oscillator is.
Lets back up a step. Lots of things in the world oscillate. Think about
a swing. If you get going on the swing and then stop rocking, you swing
back and forth, back and forth, but eventually you come to a stop.
Imagine swinging on a rusted old swing set. Now give the joint where the
swing swings from a nice shot of WD-40. You can imagine that if you
repeated the experiment (get swinging to some height and then stop
pumping), you'd continue to swing longer. Why? Because the Q factor has
increased. You're swinging on a higher quality swing.
Mathematically its defined to be
$$ Q = 2 \pi \times \frac{ U }{ \Delta U } $$
or 2 pi times the total energy stored in the oscillator divided by the
energy lost in a cycle.
But, another way to gauge the Q factor is the fact that it tells you
something about how the oscillators get damped each period. As a number
it tells you how many periods need to go by for the amplitude of the
oscillations to be damped by
$$ \frac{1}{e^{2\pi}} \sim \frac{1}{535} $$
This allows you to estimate Q factors for everyday objects. A factor of
1/535 is pretty near to my threshold for observing a lot of things. What
does a factor of 535 mean in terms of sound, one of the most common ways
I interact with things around me? Well, sound is measured in decibels,
which is a logarithmic scale, where a factor of 535 in the power output
by something corresponds to a change in the decibels of
$$ dB = 10 \log_{10} \frac{1}{535} \sim -27 $$
What is a decibel change of 27 mean? Well,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_pressure#Examples_of_sound_pressure_and_sound_pressure_levels">wikipedia</a>
tells me that a calm room is somewhere between 20 and 30 decibels, where
as a TV set about a meter away is at about 60 dB. So that tells me that
if something like my keys start off making a sound comparable to the
volume I set my TV at, I can listen to it until it just gets drowned out
by the room and that should give me some estimate for the Q of my keys.
I'll keep you in suspense just a bit longer. I said I was surprised how
long the keys swing. In order to put the Q that I measured in context,
I'll tell you about a few other Qs of things you might have some
experience with.
Most swinging things that I seem to remember coming in contact with have
quality factors of about 10 or so. Swings, or things letting a meter
stick swing, stuff like that. Tuning forks, which are built to be
accurate resonators will have quality factors of about a thousand or so.
The quartz crystal in your watch, which is really supposed to be a good
oscillator has a quality factor of 10 thousand or so. One of the best Q
factors achieved by man is 10^14.
So, what was the Q factor of my keys? I counted the times I could hear
them swinging and got a count of 435. This number isn't to be taken too
seriously, but it indicated that my swinging keys have a quality factor
of something between 400 and 500, which is pretty darn good for
something that wasn't engineered. That explains why it always surprises
me, the keys always seem to swing much longer than I would anticipate.</p>

                    <p>I was reading the Wikipedia page for the Hitchhiker's Guide books the
other day and found that it started as a series of radio shows called
"The Ends of Earth." At the end of each episode, the Earth would be
destroyed. Since I feel like this is the best way to end any TV
show/movie/book/news broadcast/Mayan calendar, I will shamelessly steal
the idea.
Since this is the first End of the Earth post, we will start small and
just consider the boiling off of all the world's oceans. To be precise,
we will consider how much energy it would take to turn all the world's
water at 0 degrees Celsius to water vapor at 100 degrees Celsius.
First we need to estimate the mass of all the water on earth. I will
make the assumptions that all water is fresh water and that the oceans
account for all water on earth. These are obviously not exactly true,
but will give the proper order of magnitude. The volume of a spherical
shell is given by
$$ \text{V} = 4 \pi R^{2} \Delta R $$
Taking the radius of the earth to be 6000 km, the ocean depth to be 1
km, and the fraction of earth covered by water to be 7/10 , we see that
$$ V_\text{water} = 4 \pi {R_{\text{earth}}^{2} \times
\text{height} \times \text{fraction}$$
$$ V_\text{water} = 4 \pi (6 \times 10^{6} \text{m})^{2} \times
10^{3} \text{m} \times (\frac{7}{10}) = 3 \times 10^{17}
\text{m}^{3}$$
Now we have the volume of the ocean. Now, since
$$ \text{Density} = \frac{Mass}{Volume}$$
we can calculate the mass of the oceans using the density of water to be
1000 kg / m^3.
$$ \text{Mass} = (\rho_\text{water})(V_\text{water}) = (1000
\frac{\text{kg}}{\text{m}^{3}})(3 \times 10^{17} \text{m}^{3}) =
3 \times 10^{20} \text{kg}$$
FUN FACT: The mass of all the water on earth is about 2% the mass of
that celestial punching bag known as Pluto.
Alright, now that we have the mass of the earth, we can start
calculating how much energy it would take to heat it up and boil it
away. The amount of heat Q required to raise the temperature of a given
material is
$$ Q_\text{heat} = \text{mc}\Delta\text{T} $$
where m is the mass of the thing we are heating, c is the specific heat
( the amount of energy required to heat our material up 1 degree
Celcius) and delta T is our change in temperature. This equation only
holds when there are no phase transitions, so we can use it to calculate
how much energy is needed to heat up the oceans from 0 degrees to 100
degrees:
$$ Q_\text{heat} = (3 \times 10^{20} \text{kg}) \times (4000
\frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg C}}) \times (100 \text{deg C}) = 10^{26}
\text{J} $$
where we have used the fact that the specific heat of water is about
4000 J/kg deg C.
So now we know how much energy it takes to bring water to its boiling
point, but this is not the same as boiling it off. To find that, we need
to calculate how much energy we have to add to liquid water at a
constant 100 degrees to turn it into water vapor. This is given by
$$ Q_{\text{boil}} = \text{mL} $$
where m is the mass again and L is the "latent heat of vaporization." It
tells us how much energy we need to add to turn a kilogram of liquid
water at 100 degrees to a kilogram of water vapor at 100 degrees. For
water, L is about 2*10^6 J/kg, so
$$ Q_{\text{boil}} = ( 3 \times 10^{20} \text{kg} ) \times (2
\times 10^{6} \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg}}) = 6 \times 10^{26}
\text{J} $$
Comparing this to the energy calculated before, we see that amount of
energy needed to vaporize water at 100 degrees is about six times larger
than the amount of energy needed to heat up the water by 100 degrees!
Now we can calculate the total amount of energy to boil way the oceans:
$$ Q_{\text{total}} = Q_{\text{heat}} + Q_{\text{boil}} = 7
\times 10^{26} \text{J} $$
So how much energy is that really? Well the total power of the sun is
$$ L_{\text{sun}} = 4 \times 10^{26} \frac{\text{J}}{\text{s}} $$
Thus, it would take the entire energy output of the sun for about 2
seconds to boil away all the earth's oceans.
Now thats a lot of energy. To put this into the conventional unit of
destruction, this is equivalent to 10^11 Megatons of TNT. Typical
hydrogen bombs are 10 Megatons. So if you want to boil away the oceans
with H-bombs, you'd need about ten billion hydrogen bombs.
Luckily, short of constructing a reflecting Dyson sphere with a hole
that directs all the sun's radiation at the earth, these energies are
unobtainable. So don't panic.</p>

                    <p>Somebody I talked to yesterday about what should the topic of my post be
suggested that I should write something about cosmology, in particular
the Big Bang and the ultimate fate of the universe. Being mostly
interested in condensed matter, I am by no means an expert in cosmology
(I’ll leave that to Corky). However, I will not abandon the request, but
instead, spin it in a more condensed matter direction, by talking about
Entropy.
Entropy is a quantity that measures disorder. The more ordered your
system is, i.e. the less ways you can arrange the constituents of your
system, the less entropy you have and vice versa. I like to use the
example of how messy my room is to visualize this. When I clean my room,
I would pick up the random articles of clothing, books, etc and put them
in the places where they belong. Now imagine, I stopped cleaning my room
for a couple of weeks. This would result in clothes on the ground, books
on my bed, empty bottles on my desk, etc. anything can be anywhere. This
means that there are more ways for my personal belongings to be arranged
when my room is messy than when my room is clean (when everything would
be at its place), so the entropy increases as the messiness of my room
increases. Now, notice that left on its own (i.e. if I don’t put the
conscious effort to put some order in my room once in a while) the
entropy of the system that is my room increases with time. This is, in
fact, the essence of one of the most fundamental (if not the most
fundamental) laws of nature – The Second Law of Thermodynamics, which
states that left on its own, the entropy of any system increases with
time.
I know what you are thinking, “What does this talk about the messiness
of your room and the law of increasing entropy has to do with the
universe, the Big Bang and the universe’s ultimate fate?” Ok, here you
go, read this short story by the greatest sci-fi writer Isaac Asimov:
<a href="http://bit.ly/84LN">The Last Question.</a>
Now that you’ve read this story (if you haven’t, please do), we can
discuss some physics (or actually, some philosophy, but you know,
sometimes there isn’t that much difference between the two). Einstein,
with his Theory of Relativity, showed that the concept of time is not
absolute, and time can be treated simply as another coordinate, much
like the three spatial coordinates that define the three dimensional
space we are used to. (A more in-depth explanation of the Theory of
Relativity will be the topic of one of the next posts.) However, despite
the relativity of time, the arrow of time is always well-defined. We can
always tell future from past by measuring the entropy and applying the
Second Law of Thermodynamics. At the instance of the Big Bang, the
entropy was zero. Since then (about 13.8 billion years ago) the entropy
of the universe has been increasing until it will eventually reach its
maximum value, at which point all the matter of the universe would be
evenly distributed and no physical process would be possible. Time
eventually stops, resulting in the “heat death” of the universe.
I believe that one of the most unsettling parts of the Bing Bang theory
is the question of what caused the Big Bang, and what was there before
the Bing Bang. Having the arrow of time defined with regards to entropy,
however, makes this question nonsensical… unless, of course, a Cosmic AC
(or God) has managed to find the answer of how the entropy can be
reversed.</p>

                    <p>This is my first (but certainly not the last) post in this blog, so let
me introduce myself. My name is Nikolay, and as most of the others
contributing to the blog, I am also a first-year graduate student in
physics at Cornell.
So, what is my motivation to join the team headed by Mr. Alemi in
contributing to the blog? I happen to have many friends that are not in
physics. In fact, probably due to the fact that I graduated from a
liberal arts college, many of my friends have never taken any physics
beyond that one class in high school, which due to both the inherent
difficulty of teaching physics at introductory level and the lack of
good high school physics teachers was often an unpleasant experience
that scared them away from physics for life. Now, imagine what my
difficulty is when on a daily basis I have to answer the question: “So
what do you study/work on as a graduate student?” I usually try to come
up with a sentence or two describing the essence of what I am doing
without going into too many details, but even that is a daunting task.
There seems to be a disconnect between the world in which a physicist
lives and the general public. As Chad Orzel pointed out in the talk that
motivated the creation of this blog, this is not the general public’s
fault, but our fault as physicists of not really committing enough
effort in relating our knowledge to the rest of the world.
In short, my goal is to create a series of posts about physics geared to
people with no physics background that would build upon each other and
culminate with a post providing an answer to the question of what my
research project is beyond the generic words I would often resort to
that would rather leave most people confused. I plan to use as little
math as possible, which will not be an easy task considering that math
is the language of choice for physics. However, mathematics is just a
tool, and physics is not about equations and complicated algebra, but
about how nature works, which we should be able to formulate in plain
English. I know I am embarking on a difficult task, so wish me luck, and
please leave your thoughts in the remarks section of the blog, since any
feedback would be appreciated.</p>

                    <p>In 1943 in a <em>tour de force</em> of mathematical physics, Lars Onsager

His solution has proved crucial in furthering statistical mechanics,
allowing theorists to check all of there approximation schemes against
analytical results. I call his effort a <em>tour de force</em> because it was a
huge mathematical exercise, his solution spanning 33 pages. I also call
it a '<em>tour de force</em>' because I have seen it referenced as such in no
less than 5 different sources, as well as numerous times in speech. This
got me wondering, just how many times is Onsager's solution called a
<em>tour de force</em>... So, first I started with a Google books search, and
turned up <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22tour%20de%20force%22%20onsager%20ising&amp;num=30&amp;hl=en&amp;newwindow=1&amp;safe=off&amp;tbo=s&amp;tbs=bks:1&amp;ei=HaTHS_qSNYa0lQer-8jEAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=tool&amp;resnum=0&amp;ct=tlink&amp;ved=0CDAQpwU4Hg">39
Books</a>,
among the one's that Google has indexed, which surely represent only the
tip of the iceburg. The books search turns up some of the more popular
statistical mechanics books including Kadanoff and Goldenfeld. And I
happen to know its also called a <em>tour de force</em> in Sethna's book and
Cardy's. Interestingly, the earliest mention in the book search is
<a href="http://books.google.com/books?ei=HaTHS_qSNYa0lQer-8jEAQ&amp;ct=result&amp;id=McHvAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22tour+de+force%22+onsager+ising&amp;q=%22tour+de+force%22#search_anchor">Magnetism, Volume 2, Part 1 By George Tibor Rado, Harry
Suhl</a>,
from 1963, 19 years after Onsager's paper. Next I used Google Scholar to
try and turn up some references in papers as well. I got <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=%22tour+de+force%22+onsager+ising&amp;btnG=Search&amp;as_sdt=20000000000&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_vis=0">73
results</a>,
the earliest of which I have access to is: <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1973JSP.....8..265F">Field theory of the
two-dimensional Ising model: Equivalence to the free particle
one-dimensional Dirac equation, Ferrell, Richard
A.</a> In fact, making a
histogram of the appearances, it looks like the term's usage is only
increasing.
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S8epu8Hr4yI/AAAAAAAAAJo/SH2qQktvO-g/s1600/onsager.png"><img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S8epu8Hr4yI/AAAAAAAAAJo/SH2qQktvO-g/s320/onsager.png"></a>
I'm not sure what's more impressive. The fact that Onsager was able to
solve the 2D Ising model, or the fact that his solution was so
impressive that it has become almost necessary to refer to it as a <em>tour
de force</em>. If you feel like a challenge, we're still waiting on a
solution to the 3D Ising model. It appears to be a hard problem, in fact
it looks as though its <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://www.siam.org/pdf/news/654.pdf">NP
Complete</a>.
So get to work! (Note: the last document doesn't refer to Onsager's
solution by its proper name, instead calling it a <em>breakthrough</em>, tsk
tsk)</p>

I assume everyone has heard of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_core">The
Core</a>, the terrible scifi movie
from 2003. If you haven't you're missing out on what appears to be,
according to Discover magazine, <a href="http://discovermagazine.com/2007/nov/none-found">the worst sci-fi film
ever</a>. There are
already numerous sites that discuss the bad science in the core
(<a href="http://geolor.com/The_Core_Movie-Facts_and_Fiction.htm">here</a>, or over
at <a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/movies/thecore_review.html">Bad
Astronomy</a>),
but they all seem to ignore another fundamental problem with the plot. I
don't think I'll give too much away if I tell you that the basic premise
of the movie is that the earth's core has stopped rotating, and so the
earth's magnetic field is collapsing, which they claim will mean that
all of the previously deflected microwaves (note: EM radiation is not
bent by a magnetic field) will cook us all. Now, a lot of people have
focused on the microwaves bit, which while bad science, one could argue
that we would still have some bad effects from loosing our magnetic
field. The problem I have is that the Earth's magnetic field cannot
change that abruptly. I'm currently teaching undergraduate honors E&amp;M,
and we're working out of the fantastic texbook (unfortunately now out of
print) by
<a href="http://books.google.com/books?ei=tn7HS87OGYKuygS9yqCNCw&amp;cd=1&amp;id=3LYRAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Purcell+Electromagnetism&amp;q=#search_anchor">Purcell</a>.
And in the chapter on electromagnetic induction he has an illuminating
exercise. Lets try and estimate how quickly the magnetic field of the
earth can change. Well, lets sort of work backwards. We know that if we
have a conducting ring with a current flowing through it, this will
create a magnetic field. So, if we can try and model some sort of
circuit that approximates the earth, and then look at how quickly energy
is dissipated in that circuit, we can estimate how fast the magnetic
field decays. So lets imagine a thick torus with height and width a.
Flowing around this torus is some current I, distributed in a
complicated way. The torus is made out of a material with some
conductivity sigma. Now, we know that for a wire made out of some
material with a conductivity sigma, we can estimate its resistance as $$
R = \frac{ L }{ \sigma A } $$ where L is the length, and A is the
cross sectional area of the wire. Lets do that with our torus, calling
$$ A = a^2 \qquad L = 2 \pi a $$ giving us a resistance $$ R \sim
\frac{ 2 \pi }{ \sigma a } $$ To estimate the magnetic field of this
torus, lets just take the magnetic field of a loop with radius a/2. I.e.
$$ B = \frac{ \mu_0 I }{2 \pi (a/2) } $$ Now we know that the energy
stored in the magnetic field is $$ U = \frac{1}{2 \mu_0 } \int B^2
\ dV \sim \frac{1}{2 \mu_0} B V $$ where we take the magnetic field
to be the magnetic field of the simple loop and V to be the volume of a
fat cylinder or so, i.e. $$ V \sim \pi a^2 \times a $$ Now if we
have a circuit with a known resistance we know that the energy is
dissipated through the resistor $$ \frac{dU}{dt} = - I^2 R $$ so if we
just want an order of magnitude estimate for the characteristic decay
time, we can take $$ \tau \sim \frac{ U }{ I^2 R } $$ Putting in our
approximations from above we have $$ \tau \sim \frac{
\frac{1}{2\mu_0 } B^2 V }{ I^2 \frac{2 \pi }{ \sigma a } } =
\frac{ \frac{1}{2 \mu_0 } ( \pi a^3 ) \left( \frac{ \mu_0 I }{
2 \pi (a/2) } \right)^2 }{ I^2 \frac{ 2 \pi }{\sigma a} } =
\frac{ \mu_0 }{4 \pi^2 } \sigma a^2 $$ where we know $$ \mu_0 =
4 \pi \times 10^{-7} N/A^2 $$ we obtain roughly (i.e. ignoring the
other pi) $$ \tau \sim \sigma a^2 \times 10^{-7} (s) $$ Now, lets
take the radius of the core to be about half the radius of the earth, or
3000 km or so, and take the conductivity of the core to be about a tenth
of that of iron at room temperature (iron becomes a worse conductor when
its heated), i.e. $$ a \sim 3000 (km) \qquad \sigma \sim 10^6 (S/m)
$$ We obtain $$ \tau \sim 10^12 (s) = 300 (centuries) $$ So, even if
you could magically make the core of the earth stop spinning, the
magnetic field is not going to change instantaneously, in fact it would
only be able to change on the order of 300 centuries or so. This is
really short on geologic time scales, but nothing like the week or so
that the movie The Core takes place over. Just one more reason why one
of the worst sci-fi movies of all time is bad.</p>

<p>This photo has been making the rounds on the internet lately:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S8VQNEo7GUI/AAAAAAAAAJA/mHcIfKfPleM/s1600/pinholecamerajd09.jpg"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S8VQNEo7GUI/AAAAAAAAAJA/mHcIfKfPleM/s400/pinholecamerajd09.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Originally from <a href="http://helpmyphysics.co.uk/wordpress/?p=276">here</a>. Its
a time lapse photo of the sun taken from a pinhole camera from June
until December. The real question is: Where was this photo taken?</p>
<h4>Wandering Sun</h4>
<p>Well, first lets think a second about why the sun would wander in the
sky. As you may already know, the earth's pole is not aligned with our
solar system's axis. The earth's axis has what is called a 23.5 degree
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_Axis">axial tilt</a>, or obliquity.
As a result, if you sit at a fixed latitude on the earth, then as the
earth revolves around the sun and the year goes by, the angle the sun
makes with the horizon changes. We need to estimate how much the sun's
angle in the sky changes. Consider the following diagram</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S8VVHRzTrXI/AAAAAAAAAJI/zxe2OAcYSSw/s1600/diagram.png"><img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S8VVHRzTrXI/AAAAAAAAAJI/zxe2OAcYSSw/s400/diagram.png"></a></p>
<p>You'll notice that the angle that the dashed line towards the sun makes
with respect to the dotted horizon line, changes when the earth is on
either side of the sun. But how much does it change? We can estimate it
by realizing that the angle of that triangle centered at the sun is very
small. Very small indeed. We could estimate its size by: $$ \arctan
\frac{R_{\text{Earth}}}{D_{\text{Earth-Sun}}} \approx
0.002^{\circ} $$ Very small. So, knowing that the one angle is very
tiny, and remembering that the sum of all of the angles in a triangle
must add up to 180 degrees, we can calculate how much that angle in the
sky changes. Notice that the angle between the line pointing to our
latitude of interest and the equator has a known angle, namely the angle
there is our latitude +/- 23.5 degrees. So if that is the angle our
observation point makes with the horizontal, by the reasoning above, the
angle that the sun makes with respect to our observation point ought to
be 180 - our latitude +/- 23.5 degrees. So on either side of the sun,
the difference in this angle from summer to winter is just twice 23.5
degrees of 47 degrees. So, regardless of where you are on the earth,
between when the sun is highest in the sky, and when it is lowest in the
sky, there ought to be a 47 degree difference. (Assuming of course you
can see the sun year round, which you can't if you live too far north).
Great. So we know that the difference between the height of the traces
in the picture and the bottom needs to be 47 degrees. But that still
doesn't help us calculate the latitude the picture was taken at.</p>
<h4>Finding Latitude in theory</h4>
<p>Looking at our diagram again, we notice that when the sun is lowest in
the sky, we can calculate directly what angle the sun should make with
respect to the horizon (psi) (We already obtained the upper angle in our
triangle, the last part is realizing that the angle to the horizon from
the radial line is just 90 degrees). We obtain $$ \psi = \theta -
90^\circ + 23.5^\circ = \theta + 66.5^\circ $$ So, turning it on
its head, we can calculate the latitude (theta) we are at if we know the
lowest angle the sun makes in the sky $$ \theta = 66.5^\circ - \psi
$$ Great.</p>
<h4>Finding Latitude in Practice</h4>
<p>So, now I know two things. The total angle difference between the upper
most the sun gets and the lowest point in the sky is 47 degrees. And I
also know that if I know the angle between the horizon and the lowest
point the sun gets in the sky, I can calculate the latitude. So how am I
going to do this, well, I just took the picture and opened it up in
Gimp, and used the measure tool to get the difference between the
highest and lowest points in the sky in pixels, and the distance to the
horizon in pixels. Here's one example of my guesses:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S8VZsHEcTMI/AAAAAAAAAJQ/fOqIQq1776I/s1600/pinholecamerajdwithlines.jpg"><img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S8VZsHEcTMI/AAAAAAAAAJQ/fOqIQq1776I/s320/pinholecamerajdwithlines.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Getting the differences in height for the sun was relatively straight
forward. In order to get the distance to the horizon, I had to guess a
little bit. I just lined it up by eye to where I thought the horizon
should be in the picture since its not visible. Why does this do me any
good? Well assuming the picture doesn't have too much distortion, since
I know the one angle is 47 degrees, I can make a comparison between the
pixel lengths. Lets say in the picture above I call the length of the
green line B, and the length of the yellow line S, then I can estimate
$$ \frac{\psi}{S} = \frac{47^\circ}{B} $$ which gives me a measure
on psi. Since I was doing this by eye, I repeated the measurement ten
times independently for each, obtaining in the end $$ B = 356 \pm 2
\qquad S = 66 \pm 6 $$ And I have a complete formula for my estimation
of the latitude $$ \theta = 66.5^\circ - 47^\circ \frac{S}{B} $$</p>
<h4>Results</h4>
<p>This allowed me to estimate the latitude at 58 +/- 1 degree latitude.
Naturally, I can't tell the difference between 58 degrees north or 58
degrees south. To get a better idea of what this guess looks like, here
I've overlayed the possible locations in green</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S8VcAVzG7jI/AAAAAAAAAJY/3csC2nzT8OM/s1600/world1.jpg"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/S8VcAVzG7jI/AAAAAAAAAJY/3csC2nzT8OM/s400/world1.jpg"></a></p>
<p>You'll notice that there isn't much life down at 58 degrees south of the
equator. So, I reckon the picture was taken in the northern hemisphere.
Surfing around on the webpage where the picture was found, you'll first
notice that its taken from a co.uk site (Great Britain), and if you go
to the homepage, Mr. Mallon has a weather widget which says Bellshill.
<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;gl=us&amp;g=Bellshill&amp;q=Bellshill,+UK+lattitude+longitude&amp;btnG=Search+Maps">Google
Maps</a>
tells me that Bellshill, UK is at about 56 degrees North. I've tried to
put a green dot on the map above near where Bellshill actually is (its
hard to see). Not bad for a night's work.</p>

                    <p>There were some undergrads in my office for office hours the other day,
asking questions for the midterm. I'm teaching the engineering course on
optics and waves (also known as Things that go Sine) and the students
were looking at a problem dealing with quarter-wave plates. A
quarter-wave plate, the question goes, is a kind of optical instrument
that turns light with linear polarization into circular polarization.
Show, it continues, that it also turns light with circular polarization
linear. After a minute or two of discussing how a quarter-wave plate
work ("what, does it act differently on different axes?" giggled one,
and everybody gasped when I said yes) we went to the math. I wrote down
the equations for light with linear and circular polarization, $$ E_0
\hat{x} \cos\left(kz-\omega t\right) \to
\frac{E_0}{\sqrt{2}}\hat{x}\cos\left(kz-\omega t\right) +
\frac{E_0}{\sqrt{2}}\hat{y}\sin\left(kz-\omega t\right) $$ with
a little arrow in between them to signify that the quarter-wave plate
turns one into the other. This was acceptable, so we continued. What
happens when light with circular polarization enters the plate? Well, we
start out the other way:
$$\frac{E_0}{\sqrt{2}}\hat{x}\cos\left(kz-\omega t\right) +
\frac{E_0}{\sqrt{2}}\hat{y}\sin\left(kz-\omega t\right) $$ and
then break it up into components. The first term obviously behaves
exactly the same as in the previous case,
$$\frac{E_0}{\sqrt{2}}\hat{x}\cos\left(kz-\omega t\right) \to
\frac{E_0}{2}\hat{x}\cos\left(kz-\omega t\right) +
\frac{E_0}{2}\hat{y}\sin\left(kz-\omega t\right) $$ while the
second term is easy to extrapolate from there,
$$\frac{E_0}{\sqrt{2}}\hat{y}\sin\left(kz-\omega t\right) \to
-\frac{E_0}{2}\hat{x}\cos\left(kz-\omega t\right) +
\frac{E_0}{2}\hat{y}\sin\left(kz-\omega t\right) $$ and adding
them both up, we get on the other side of the quarter-wave plate
$$E_0\hat{y}\sin\left(kz-\omega t\right)$$ a linearly polarized
wave. Simple, right? Almost simple. There's one trick in there, which
you may have noticed if you were following. My student noticed it - but
she's a clever one - and she asked me why I put that minus sign in the
second transformation equation. And my honest answer was that I put it
there to get the result I wanted. Sure, I can back it up with more math
(handedness, or maybe I can figure it out by redrawing the axes) but
when I was writing those equations on the board, I put that minus sign
there because I was expecting a certain result. And really, we do this
all the time. The math isn't neutral; it's an ally (or an enemy,
sometimes) that we're bending to get the result we want - because of
intuition, because of a previous results, because this is a homework
problem with a known solution - or because we have an experimental
result that we really want to be in accord with. This isn't a problem,
necessarily. Sometimes it leads us to wrong results, sometimes it helps
us reach the correct ones. It usually makes our life easier, and
sometimes makes them a lot harder. Keeping this bias in mind when we do
our math should hopefully lead to more of the first and less of the
second.</p>

film such as soap stretched across a membrane ready for bubble making?
Well, I encountered this problem when I presented my intro physics
section with a quiz question today. Properly stated, the question was...
"Suppose white light is incident on a thin film (a soap bubble of
n=1.33) hanging vertically inside of a square loop. The minimum
thickness of the film at the top of the loop is 900nm and it increases
linearly (due to gravity) to 1300nm by the bottom of the loop which is
10cm away. This means that the thickness as a function of distance from
the top of the loop is
$$ d(x) = \text{900nm} + \text{400nm} * \left(
\frac{x}{\text{10cm}} \right) $$
What wavelengths will be most strongly reflected as a function of
distance along our bubble film?"
So I got to thinking - don't the partially interfering wavelengths also
contribute to the image that our eyes see? Isn't there a better mass
profile to use such as an exponential? Linear is just silly.
As for the first question, if you consider a single ray entering the
thin film and reflecting off both the first interface as well as the
second, then there is a phase difference between the two reflected
waves,
$$ \Delta \phi = \pi + 2\pi * \frac{2d}{\lambda} $$
where d is the thickness of the film and lambda is the wavelength. If we
consider these two waves as two standing waves added together with a
phase then we see that the superposition of their electric fields, for
example, is
$$ E_{tot} = E_0 \cos(\omega t) + E_0 \cos(\omega t + \Delta
\phi) $$
$$ E_{tot} = E_0 \sin(\omega t) \cos(\Delta \phi) $$
The intensity that our eyes see then goes like the square of this giving
an effective damping to certain wavelengths as given by
$$ \delta = \cos^2(\Delta \phi) $$
Using a more realistic exponential mass profile and this damping factor
for wavelengths in the visible spectrum, I created the top image using
OpenIL (maybe it's called DevIL, hard to say).</p>
