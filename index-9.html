  Cold-Blooded Killer</p>
<hr>
<p>Hello all and welcome to to another roundup of Problem of the Week. If
the time intervals don't seem to be adding up, just remember that "week"
is an illusion here at Virtuosi headquarters. "Problem of the Week,"
doubly so. But enough with the excuses, let's see if Mr. Bond lives to
Die Another Day. The situation presented in the problem was one of a
glass of water filled all the way to the top with a single ice cube in
it. The goal is to see if any water falls to the floor as the ice cube
melts. The simplest analysis would be to just consider the displacement
of water by the ice cube. By Archimedes' principle we know that the
buoyant force on the ice cube is equal to the weight of the water
displaced by the ice cube. But since the ice cube is floating, we know
that the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the ice cube.
Therefore, the ice cube just displaces it's own weight in water. So as
the ice cube melts, the water level stays the same and no water is
spilled over. Stated a bit more explicitly, we have that the buoyant
force is the weight of the displaced water: $$ F_b = m_{water}g =
{\rho}<em water>{water}V</em>g $$ where we have just expressed the mass of
the water as the density of water times the volume of the water
displaced. Likewise, the weight of the ice cube is $$ W_{ice} =
m_{ice}g = {\rho}<em ice>{ice}V</em>g $$ But since the ice cube is
floating, the buoyant force is equal to the weight. Setting the above
equations equal to each other and rearranging a bit, we can solve for
the volume of the water displaced by the ice cube: $$ V_{water} =
\frac{{\rho}<em ice>{ice}V</em>}{{\rho}<em ice>{water}} $$ Great, now we have
the volume of water that the ice cube displaced, so now we just need to
see what volume of water the ice cube will add once it melts. Since we
know that the mass of ice cube better be the same as the mass of the
water left after it melts, we can write $$ {\rho}</em>V_{ice} =
{\rho}<em water>{water}V</em> $$ which gives that the total volume of the
water is just
$$ V_{water} = \frac{{\rho}<em ice>{ice}V</em>}{{\rho}_{water}} $$
which is exactly the same volume we found before. Therefore, when the
ice cube melts it fills up exactly the same amount of volume as the
water displaced to hold up the ice cube, so the water level remains the
same and James Bond lives!
Or does he? Well, he sure does if the system is entirely described by
the analysis above. But we need to be exact here since a single drop
would set off the Koala death trap. We have considered the biggest
contributions to the change of volume of the water (and easiest to
calculate!), but we have ignored a large number of much much smaller
effects on the volume. Typically these effects would be swept aside and
callously labeled "negligible," but since even the smallest change of
volume could mean life or death for our hero, they must be accounted for
to give a final "exact" answer.
Unfortunately, "exact" isn't something science can do very well. We can
only do as good as the measurements we make allow. And since I gave you
practically no information, this was very tough. However, one could
consider the magnitude of the effects given typical values and see which
side wins out. But if two competing effects give similar values under
reasonable conditions, it becomes very difficult to give an answer.
The last two "Problems of the Week" were well posed math problems, each
with a clear-cut "correct" answer. This one was a physics problem and
physics is a lot messier than math. That may initially seem less
satisfying, but it means that there is a whole lot of interesting "mess"
to sort out! I really enjoyed reading the
<a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/11/problem-of-week-3.html#more">comments</a>
detailing all the neat small effects to the change of volume that I
ignored in my solution. Density variations as a function of temperature,
surface tension effects, evaporation and thermal expansion all play some
role in determining the final answer. There's a whole lot of interesting
physics going on!
Without knowing the exact conditions a bit more and doing a whole lot
more work, it seems as though I will not be able to provide a final
physics solution. But, having seen just about every Bond movie, I can
give an answer with a certainty not afforded to me by science: Mr. Bond
lives. How do I know this? Well, it is common knowledge that James Bond
has tiny smoke grenades in the soles of his shoes that release a potent
koala knock-out potion specifically created by Q. So Bond releases these
into the koala death pit, rendering the vicious beasts harmless. Then he
uses his watch laser to cut any bindings Dr. Cherrycoke may have placed
him in, falling into the death pit. The fall leaves Mr. Bond uninjured,
as a cuddly mass of sleeping koalas break his fall. By stacking the
koalas into a rudimentary series of steps, Mr. Bond ascends out of the
death pit and free to save the world's ice supply from the evil Dr.
Cherrycoke.
Obviously.</p>

<p>Human beings are not equipped for dealing with large numbers. Honestly,
7 thousand, 7 million, 7 billion and 7 trillion all register about the
same in my mind, namely 7 big. Unfortunately, there is a world a
different between each of these, three whole orders of magnitude, a
thousand, the difference between lifting me and a US quarter. This lack
of respect for orders of magnitude has really been rearing its head
recently with most of the political discussions surrounding the US
budget. Turns out the US Budget is really large. In 2010 it weighed in
at $3.55 trillion. Thats big. Really big. So big that I can't fathom it.
Without getting too political, there has been a site going around
recently; the <a href="http://republicanwhip.house.gov/YouCut/week13.htm">You Cut
program</a>, which
invites public suggestions for cuts to be made to the budget to try and
fix the deficit. Now, personally, I believe we ought to do something
about the deficit. To this end, I think it is useful to point out the
scales involved. In particular, the link I gave above is to one of the
suggested cuts: federal funding of NPR (Disclaimer alert: I love NPR),
which weighs in at 7 million dollars. Seven million dollars is a lot of
money. A lot of money, more than I can imagine having personally. But to
suggest that a 7 million dollar cut is any sort of progress towards
solving a $1.2 trillion dollar deficit is a little amusing. As a
fraction, this comes out to $$ \frac{ 7 \text{ million} }{ 3.55
\text{ trillion} } = 2 \times 10^{-6} $$ Two parts in a million. To
give a sense of scale to this, the gravitational influence of the moon
on my weight is: $$ \frac{ \frac{ G M_{\text{moon}} }{
R_{\text{earth-moon}}^2 } }{ 10 \text{ m/s}^2 } = 3 \times
10^{-6} $$ Three parts in a million. So, suggesting that you have made
real gains in reducing the US budget by cutting federal funding for NPR
is as silly as suggesting that if I want to lose weight, my first
concern should be the current tides. [I want to point out that I don't
really mean to get too political, and that I've noticed both parties
pulling these kinds of numbers tricks.] So, wanting to get a little
better understanding of the numbers at stake, I collected some data (all
from the 2010 budget). My goal is to attempt to represent how the US
government spends its money. Before I begin I need to plug two great
tools towards this end:
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/02/01/us/budget.html">Here</a> the
NYTimes graphically represents government spending, helping to give a
sense of scale to different categories.
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/11/13/weekinreview/deficits-graphic.html">Here</a>
the NYTimes lets you try and balance the budget, not only for next year
but down the line, letting you choose from a wide array of proposed
changes. The Data So, below is a list of some of the relevant numbers I
could thing of, and some reference numbers (trillion, billion, million),
as well as the US debt, and total deficit. In addition to just reporting
the numbers (which you can find anywhere), in the second column I give
the fraction of total spending in scientific units.</p>
<hr>
<p>Name             $               Fraction
  US Debt          13.8 trillion   3.9
  Total Spending   3.55 trillion   1.0
  Budget Deficit   1.17 trillion   3.3E-1
  1 trillion       1 trillion      2.8E-1
  SS / Def / MM    730 billion     2.1E-1
  Education        93 billion      2.6E-2
  Taxes (250G+)    54 billion      1.5E-2
  Science          31 billion      8.7E-3
  1 billion        1 billion       2.8E-4
  NPR              7 million       2.0E-6
  1 million        1 million       2.8E-7</p>
<hr>
<p>So here, SS / Def / MM means each of Social Security, Defense spending
and Medicare and Medicaid, which each comes in at about the same per
program. We spend 730 billion on each of these. To first glance, these
three programs are how the US spends money, each of these coming in at
21%. Notice also just how large the deficit is, coming in at 33% of
total spending. The rather cryptic "Taxes (250G+)" is how much money
would be saved by letting the Bush tax cuts expire for those making more
than 250,000 a year, a currently hotly debated topic. Notice that it
would only ease the burden by 15%. So this alone would only cut the
budget deficit in half. The above table shows the power of scientific
notation. (Even though I had to use the ugly "E" notation). A number
like "2.8E-4" is really 2.9 x 10^(-4). But honestly, even a list like
this doesn't really make an impact for me. So, I thought of a couple
other ways to represent the same numbers, scaling them to some 'big'
things I can conceive of:</p>
<h4>Barry's Budget</h4>
<p>Now, this might not be a fair comparison, but let's scale down the US
budget to sizes that a person can understand. By scaling by a factor of
$100 million, we end up with the story of my friend Barry.</p>
<hr>
<p>Name             $               Fraction   Barry
  US Debt          13.8 trillion   3.9        $138,495.50
  Total Spending   3.55 trillion   1.0        $35,500.00
  Budget Deficit   1.17 trillion   3.3E-1     $11,690.0
  1 trillion       1 trillion      2.8E-1     $10,000.00
  SS / Def / MM    730 billion     2.1E-1     $7,296.67
  Education        93 billion      2.6E-2     $930.00
  Taxes (250G+)    54 billion      1.5E-2     $540.00
  Science          31 billion      8.7E-3     $310.00
  1 billion        1 billion       2.8E-4     $10.00
  NPR              7 million       2.0E-6     $0.07
  1 million        1 million       2.8E-7     $0.01</p>
<hr>
<p>As you'll notice, Barry makes $23,810.00 a year (total receipts)[he's a
grad student], but spends $35,500 a year. This has created his current
debt problem. Barry has $138,495 in credit card debt, and still
overspends by $11,690 a year. How does Barry spend his money? Well,
every year Barry buys some $7,300 in guns, spends another $14,600 mostly
taking care of his grandma. He pays a tuition of $930 a year at school,
and $310 on science books. Every year he donates 7 cents to NPR. Every
million US dollars is 1 penny in Barry dollars.</p>
<h4>Work Week</h4>
<p>That might not have been fair. This time, lets scale the US government
spending to a work week of 40 hours. I think a work week is a large
amount of time that I still have a real grasp for.</p>
<hr>
<p>Name             $               Work Time      Guess at time
  US Debt          13.8 trillion   156 hours      Work month
  Total Spending   3.55 trillion   40 hours       Work week
  Budget Deficit   1.17 trillion   13 hours       All Mon and Tue morn
  1 trillion       1 trillion      11.3 hours     two days of good work
  SS / Def / MM    730 billion     8.2 hour       true work in a day
  Education        93 billion      63 minutes     lunch break
  Taxes (250G+)    54 billion      36 minutes     cooler chat
  Science          31 billion      21 minutes     Show on Hulu
  1 billion        1 billion       40 seconds     Stretching at desk
  NPR              7 million       0.3 seconds    mouse click
  1 million        1 million       0.04 seconds   blink</p>
<hr>
<h4>Cross Country</h4>
<p>Now lets scale to a distance. The longest drive I've ever done is from
Los Angeles, CA to Orlando, Fl, which was 2511 miles. In terms of this
scale, the budget breaks down as:</p>
<hr>
<p>Name             $               Dist    <br>
  US Debt          13.8 trillion   9796 mi   NY - Sydney
  Total Spending   3.55 trillion   2511 mi   LA - Orlando
  Budget Deficit   1.17 trillion   827 mi    Texas
  1 trillion       1 trillion      707 mi  <br>
  SS / Def / MM    730 billion     516 mi    Orlando - Mobile
  Education        93 billion      66 mi   <br>
  Taxes (250G+)    54 billion      38 mi   <br>
  Science          31 billion      22 mi     Cross town
  1 billion        1 billion       0.7 mi    14 blocks
  NPR              7 million       9 yards <br>
  1 million        1 million       4 feet    </p>
<hr>
<p>(So I just want to point out again, claiming that cutting NPR funding
makes a dent in the US budget is similar to claiming you've moved closer
to Orlando (while in LA) by crossing the room.)</p>
<h3>The Lesson</h3>
<p>So, without getting too political... I'd just like to point out that if
our politicians are serious about solving the budget crisis, they need
to stop talking about million dollar programs, and start taking about
100 billion dollar ones. The problem is that it's hard to either slash
funding for large programs like defense, or social security, and it's
even harder raise taxes (really at all). But if we never consider those
options, we're never going to get out of the rut. In my undergraduate
physics lab, the instructor had a mantra: "A number without context is
meaningless". Now, he originally meant the statement to be a lesson on
how important it is to quote errors on your measurements, but I think I
can adapt it to apply to giving out numbers like 7 billion without a
sense of scale.</p>

                    <p>Good Monday evening all, and welcome to another edition of Your Week in
Seminars. Last week was a half week here in Cornell, but we still
managed two talks, the general colloquium and the
Wednseday-talk-on-Tuesday. Monday we had Charles Marcus of Harvard talk
about Building Schrödinger's Chip. This was a quantum computing talk. We
don't actually have a quantum computing group in Cornell, but I've taken
a couple of courses on it back home, and it's an interesting subject,
although I've been a bit disillusion by the notable lack of problems
solvable by quantum computers. Marcus started by talking about the
wonders and insanities of quantum mechanics - the usual spiel about the
two slit experiment, electrons passing through walls, and Schrödinger's
cat. He said he dubbed the talk Schrödinger's chip because unlike cats,
that appear to break when we put them in the kind of low-temperature
vacuum conditions we like to do quantum experiments in, chips keep
working pretty well. Next he introduced the concept of entanglement,
which is at the basis of the whole concept of quantum computing.
Entangled particles are two or more particles that do not have a
definite quantum state, but are definitely in the same quantum state. If
I take them apart and measure their state - say, spin up or down - then
I do not know the answer, but as soon one turns up, the other is up as
well, and if one is down the other is immediately down as well. The
experimental side of quantum computing is all about making little
quantum boxes that contain a small number of states (like up or down)
and then making it possible to entangle two of those boxes together. Add
up enough boxes, under some criteria that were posited a decade ago but
still not achieved, and you have a quantum computer. The majority of the
talk was a survey of the various state of the art boxes and the methods
used to make them. For those keeping track, 15 is still the largest
number factored by a quantum computer. On Tuesday, I came in just in
time for the second half of John Terning's talk on Monopoles, Anomalies,
and Electroweak Symmetry Breaking. It's not really ideal to go into the
second half of a talk in Newman 311, and this one actually sounded like
I missed some interesting stuff. The part that I heard was about adding
magnetic monopoles to the standard model., Those lovely magnetic
equivalents of the electric point charge that we all heard about in our
undergraduate E&amp;M course turn out to be surprisingly hard to integrate
into basic particle theories, which is perhaps for the best as we have
not detected them so far. The gist of what I got from the second half of
the talk was that it is not enough to add a magnetic counterpart to the
electric part of the standard model, but in fact one needs a magnetic
QCD and Weak force as well. Under some conditions, this kind of
configuration can work, and predict magnetic monopoles with TeV-scale
masses - the kind we might see in the LHC. Terning also talked about how
these could be detected in the LHC. It turns out this isn't simple,
because at TeV we would be producing monopole-anti-monopole pairs just
barely, and so without a lot of kinetic energy they would tend to
collapse back on themselves and annihilate, creating what is essentially
an omnidirectional shower of photons. He mentioned that one of the big
detectors at the LHC - the CMS - was equipped to detect these kind of
photon bursts, and so this another prediction or possibility that we can
look forward to seeing or not seeing soon. That's it for last week, kind
of on the short side due to the holiday and so on. This week is our last
normal one, as the semester ends, but I'll have a couple more particle
talks the week after that, as well.</p>

                    <p>Thanks to all who sent in solutions! We are very happy with the vast
number of responses, and we will put up a leader board shortly! Solution
Let A be the fraction of the rubber band that the ant has traversed.
$$A\left(t\right)=\frac{x\left(t\right)}{L+vt}.$$ The ant's
velocity relative to any point along the rubber band is equal to the
length of the rubber band times the first time derivative of A:
$$u=\left(L+vt\right)\frac{dA}{dt}=\left(L+vt\right)\left[\frac{\dot{x}}{L+vt}-\frac{vx}{\left(L+vt\right)^{2}}\right]=\dot{x}-\frac{vx}{L+vt}.$$
This gives us an inseparable, first-order differential equation for
x(t). The general differential equation of this type,
$$\dot{x}+p\left(t\right)x=q\left(t\right),$$ has the general
solution $$x\left(t\right)=e^{-\int_{0}^{t}
p\left(t\right)dt}\int_{0}^{t} q\left(t\right)e^{\int_{0}^{t}
p\left(t\right)dt}dt.$$ In our case,
$$p\left(t\right)=-\frac{v}{L+vt},\quad q\left(t\right)=u.$$
Therefore, $$x\left(t\right)&amp;=&amp;e^{\int\frac{v}{L+vt}dt}\int
ue^{-\int\frac{v}{L+vt}dt}dt=\frac{u}{v}\left(L+vt\right)\ln\left(1+\frac{vt}{L}\right).$$
When the ant has reached the other side, x(t) = L + vt, so
$$x\left(t\right)=L+vt=\frac{u}{v}\left(L+vt\right)\ln\left(1+\frac{vt}{L}\right).$$
Solving for t, we get $$t=\frac{L}{v}\left(e^{v/u}-1\right).$$ So
the ant always makes it to the other side (unless u = 0)! In the limit
as v -&gt; 0, we get $$t\approx\frac{L}{u},$$ which is exactly what we
would expect. We can show that the ant will reach the other side without
doing any calculations. As the ant moves across the rubber band, the
velocity of the point on the rubber band that the ant is currently
walking on increases from 0 to v. Therefore, the ant is accelerating.
Since the other end of the rubber band is moving at a constant velocity,
the accelerating ant will always eventually catch up to the far end.
Another way to see this is that since the ant is accelerating, if it
makes it halfway, it will make it all the way to the other side; if it
makes it one-quarter of the way, it will make it halfway, and so on. We
know that since the ant is traveling at some nonzero velocity, it must
make it some nonzero fraction of the way to the other side. Therefore,
it must make it twice that far, and so on, all the way to the other
side. Thanks to Frank for pointing this out!</p>

                    <p>Hello everyone and welcome to another week of talks here at the physics
department. I was out of Ithaca for a bit this past week, so in this
very special edition I'm going to present a full week's worth of
seminars (one from last week and two from the previous week) in one post
covering two weeks. The Colloquium two weeks ago was given by our own
Csaba Csaki, who talked about Electroweak Symmetry Breaking and the
Physics of the TeV Scale. This was essentially an overview of
beyond-the-standard-model physics and the kind of things we expect out
of the LHC. Csaba started off by reminding us of the Standard Model, our
very successful model of particle physics that's withstood nearly every
test over the last thirty or forty years. The Standard Model is a set of
three gauge theories - three forces that a relayed by massless particles
- along with the theory of electroweak symmetry breaking that explains
why one of these powers, the Weak one, is relayed by massive particles.
This theory is well-backed by experiment, with the exception of the
crucial Higgs boson, the one that gives mass to those previously
massless W and Z, which we hope to see soon in the LHC. There are a few
problems with the Standard Model, and the big one is the Hierarchy
problem. Given what we know of symmetry breaking and how the W and Z get
their masses, we expect elementary particles to have masses that
correlate with the energy scale of the interaction that gives them this
mass. Since that interaction is not one we see at low energies, we
expect the elementary particles to be very massive. Since they are not,
we conclude that there must be some symmetry that keeps them massless or
nearly so. Some solutions to this was mentioned, beginning with
current-favorite supersymmetry. This extra symmetry relation bosons to
fermions and vice versa works well to solve the original problem, but
creates a few of its own, like the Little Hierarchy Problem - if there's
all this new physics at energies just a little higher than we've been
exploring, why don't we see its effects on the low energy physics? In
other words, why does the non-sypersymmetry Standard Model work so well?
Csaba went on to mention some ways of solving these problems, such as
burying the Higgs by allowing it to decay only in very specific ways. He
also talked about a few more, like no-Higgs theories that accomplish
electroweak symmetry breaking by different means, and extra-dimensional
theories that allow us to give different energy scales to different
forces. And the exciting thing about all of this is that we are likely
to know a great deal of the answers soon, within the next few years,
once the LHC starts giving data. On Wednesday after it we had Sven
Krippendorf from Cambridge talk about Particle Physics from local
D-brane models at toric singularities. This was a heavy string theory
talk and I couldn't follow much of it. The question at hand was how to
get the Standard Model, or parts of it, out of string theory models, and
the gist of the talk revolved around toric singularities in the
spacetime that the string theory lives in. No, I'm not entirely sure
what makes a singularity toric. There were a lot of colorful graphs and
some explanations. At the end there seemed to be some analogy made
between different types of singularities on the manifold in string
theory language and different gauge theories in the quantum field theory
language, with a way to map them to each other. Possibly exciting, but
you'd have to ask a proper string theorist about it. Then just this last
Friday, we had Rachel Rosen from Stockholm University talk about Phase
Transitions of Charged Scalars and White Dwarf Stars. This was a
blackboard talk, which is always exciting and is usually more
illustrative than Power Point ones. The subject was the thermodynamics
of white dwarf stars - stars that are very dense and old, where fusion
has mostly stopped and the only thing preventing the collapse of the
star upon itself is the fermionic pressure of the electrons, that cannot
fall into the same quantum states. The physical description of these
stars is one of relatively free positive ions, specifically helium ions
in this case, floating through a background of fermions. They are
described by a quantum condensate, which has a good theory explaining
it, but with the addition of Coulombic interaction between the ions.
This state applies, specifically, to a subgroup of these stars that are
mostly made of helium. This kind of ion condensate tends to crystallize
depending on the ratio between the kinetic and potential Coulombic
energy. Quantum effects, on the other hand, depend on some ratios of
mass and charge between the ions. The only material where this applies
turns to be helium, but luckily there are plenty of these helium-made
white dwarfs. The derivation, as Rosen showed it, starts with a neutral
Bose-Einstein condensate, which has a simple phase diagram - uncondensed
above some critical temperature, and increasing condensation as the
temperature is lowered to zero. The charged condensate introduces
photons as it is usually done in field theory and follows the
consequences. The result is a more complicated phase diagram. Under the
old Tc, the ions still condense, but things change above it. There is
now some higher temperature above which there is no condensation, but in
between there are two solutions to the equations of motions, a
condensate and a non-condensed state, and both a local energy minima.
This means that the transition into a condensate is not continuous, and
this is a first order phase transition. The nice thing here is that we
have such white dwarf stars to observe and we can compare this theory to
observations. That's it for these last two weeks. All you Americans out
there have a good Thanksgiving, and I'll see you next week with two new
seminars.</p>

James Bond has been captured by the evil mastermind Dr. Vontavious
Cherrycoke, who is trying to take over the world's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Cube">ice
cube</a> supply. The minions of Dr.
Cherrycoke have placed Mr. Bond in an elaborate and unnecessary death
contraption that, if triggered, would drop our hero into a pit of
ravenous killer koalas. In other words, certain death! Dr. Cherrycoke
has constructed a fitting trigger for his death machine / koala feeder.
A single ice cube is placed in a glass of water so that the water is
completely filling the glass up to the brim. The glass of water is then
placed on a very sensitive detector. If even a single drop of water
spills out of the glass as the ice cube melts, James Bond will find
himself on the wrong end of a murderous marsupial mauling.
Vontavious exits the room with his minions, confident that his death
trap will be triggered and Bond will be vanquished once and for all.
Does Mr. Bond survive? If not, roughly how long does it take until he
checks in to the big MI6 in the sky? Be sure to back up your answer!</p>

  You're doing it wrong!</p>
<hr>
<p>Here at the Virtuosi, we have a very specific way of asking a very
specific type of question that sounds anything but specific. These are
the "How come [blank]?" questions [1]. These are very simple questions
that just about every four year old asks, but likely never get
sufficiently answered. To get a feel for what I mean by these questions
I provide the following translations of problems we have either
considered or will consider:
Q: How come trees?
Translation: How tall can trees be?
Q: How come plants?
Translation: Why are plants green?
These are my very favorite types of questions because they are
completely understandable by everyone and promise to have very
interesting physics working behind the scenes. So I've been thrilled to
see two such questions considered by scientists lately that have also
had a good run in popular media. They are:
Q: How come cats?
Translation: How do cats drink? and
Q: How come dogs?
Translation: How do dogs shake?
The question of how cats drink was
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/preis/www/mypapers/cats_Science_Express_Reis_Aristoff_Stocker.pdf">answered</a>
recently by a few dudes from MIT, Virginia Tech and Princeton. One
morning, one of the guys was just watching his cat drink water and
realized he couldn't immediately figure out how it worked, so he decided
to do a bit more research and BAM! science happens.
It turns out that the cat isn't just scooping up the water with it
tongue as one would probably have expected. Instead the cat uses its
tongue to effectively punch the water, drawing up a column of fluid.
They then bite this column and get a very itty bitty kitty mouthful of
water. Here it is in a slow motion video I stole from the Washington
Post who stole it from Reuters: (You'll probably have to sit through an
ad, apologies)
And here's a series of stills that illustrates the same thing:
<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TOAVxjml42I/AAAAAAAAAHc/06dcbYUsowM/s1600/12cats_graphic-popup-v2.jpg"><img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TOAVxjml42I/AAAAAAAAAHc/06dcbYUsowM/s400/12cats_graphic-popup-v2.jpg"></a>
Not a cat person? Well there was also a study done a month or so ago
about dog shaking. If you have a dog, you have almost certainly
experienced the elegant way in which a wet dog un-wettafies itself.
Well, a few students at Georgia Tech were also familiar with this
shaking and just happened to have a super high speed camera that could
track water droplets. I assume it only took a short period of time to
put two and two together and BAM! science happens. In addition to
providing the logical extension of the "spherical cow" joke to "dog of
radius R", the study also found some fairly surprising results. If we
are spinning a wet cylinder (i.e. dog), we would assume that the water
is held on by some "sticking force." Then to shake off these droplets,
we'd assume that the dog would have to shake fast enough that the
centrifugal force would overcome the sticking force. In other equations,
$$ F_{centrifugal} = m{\omega}^2 R $$ and $$ F_{sticking} = C $$ So
we would then expect the shaking frequency to be the frequency that gets
those two guys to equal each other. We would thus predict
$${\omega} \sim R^{-0.5} $$
where the little squiggle just means that the frequency scales as the
radius to the -0.5 power, with some constant multipliers out front that
we don't know so we just ignore.
But this is not what the Ga Tech guys observed! Check out the video
below:
So there's still something else going on that wasn't in our simple
model. But this is what makes science so exciting! Even something dogs
and cats figured out long ago can have some really rich and interesting
physics. So keep on asking those questions! Notes: [1] Interestingly
enough, the first "How come [blank]?" questions we asked did not have
the now canonical form. Instead, it was stated as "Why are cows?". After
much deliberation, we found that the solution is "Because milkshakes."
Fair enough.</p>

                    <p>Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to another week of seminars here in
the physics department. Our theme of the week is dark matter - where
does it come from, how do we see it, and why is there so much of it.
Along with that we have a little more AdS/CFT, seemingly continuing last
week's subjects theme. All in all, it looks like seminars on similar
subjects tend to condense here in the department. We start with the
Monday Colloquium, where Richard Schnee from Syracuse University told us
about What's the Matter in the Universe? Direct Searches for WIMP Dark
Matter. Dark matter, we'll recall, is the astrophysics name for any kind
of matter that doesn't emit light - one that is not inside stars. Our
knowledge of our own solar system, which has its mass concentrated
almost entirely inside the sun, led us to expect that mass in the
universe in general would behave similarly. It turns out that the motion
of observed galaxies is not consistent with the mass we measure them to
have, and so we hypothesize the existence of non-luminary matter around
us. These days dark matter is an object of interest not only for
astrophysicists but for particle theorists as well. With our variety of
beyond-the-standard models of the universe we try to account for dark
matter, guess at its properties and explains why it is dark. That last
quality is rather easy to explain, in fact. Our expectation of dark
matter is simply that it does not interact electromagnetically, and so
does not emit photons. If we also posit that it does not interact
strongly, we are left with a particle that can only decay weakly, and so
we might expect a lot of it to stick around. Of course, the particle
must also have a mass, which is the original property we postulated for
it, and so we are looking for the WIMP, the Weakly Interacting Massive
Particle. Schnee talked about the various ways we hope to see WIMPs in
the coming decade, focusing on two avenues, the LHC and passive
detectors trying to pick up cosmic particles passing through the Earth.
WIMPs are by definitions hard to detect, because they interact only
Weakly and thus only weakly. This means that we can't actually see them
directly in our detectors, and we have to look for either missing energy
in accelerator results, which we deduce has gone to them, or their
effects on detectable particles in large particle reservoir, much as we
would detect neutrinos. Of course, when we have such weak signals the
art is in reducing the background noise, by putting them underground,
using the least radioactive materials we can find, and so on. The last
part of the talk revolved around two events in his own detector that
seemed to be far enough above background level to be WIMPs . Schnee then
explained how statistical analysis proved in fact these many statistical
outliers were, well, statistically expected, which I found very
interesting. There was also a mention at the very end, of another
experiment called DAMA, which is looking for a "WIMP wind", checking for
signals as the Earth moves through space in opposite directions, in a
kind of modern parallel of the Michelson-Morley experiment. This one has
actually shown a positive signal, though this is of course still
controversial. On Wednesday we had a local postdoc, Enrico Pajer, talk
about Striped holographic superonductor. I mentioned AdS/CFT last week,
and how it's induced some crossover between the condensed matter study
of high-temperature superconductors and particle physics. This was one
of those crossover seminars, with a few CM people in the audience.
Enrico spent about half of the talk introducing the audience to the
basics of superconductors - there were a lot of discontent as people
asked questions or had objections to statements which I imagine would
have gone over more smoothly with a condensed matter crowd . The bottom
line of the first half were three important attributes of
high-temperature superconductors, being a strong coupling between the
electrons, the existence of a quantum critical point and an
inhomogeneity of the material. There was then another general
introduction of the AdS/CFT duality, and I'll send you to last week's
summary (or the rest of the internet) if you want to hear more about
that. Enrico was working on a field theory in AdS space and trying to
apply the results to superconductors through the duality. In particular,
strong coupling and quantum criticalities are known features of the AdS
theory, and the addition here was of striped inhomogeneity, where things
change alone one axis only. This is incorporated into the AdS space by
applying boundary conditions, in particularl to the gauge field in the
relevant field theory, and reading the results by applying Einstein's,
Maxwells and the Klein-Gordon equations, in the bulk of the theory. One
interesting feature that was reproduced from other, non-AdS theories,
was the dependence of the critical temperature Tc on the inhomogeneity.
This is the temperature where superconductors turn into normal
conductors, and previous work had shown that it would to drop as the
scale of the inhomogeneity grows either very large or very small, and
have some maximum point for a finite scale of inhomogeneity. Enrico's
work showed a dropoff in Tc for inhomogeneity on very small scales,
giving the same qualitative behavior albeit with an exponential rather
than logarithmic dropoff. There were more details and math then, as they
studied these inhomogeneities in the AdS model, trying to determine the
conductivity along the stripes and perpendicular to them and so on,
producing some promising results and promising to produce some more.
Finally on Friday we had Kuver Sinha of Texas A&amp;M talk about The
Cosmological Moduli Problem and Non-thermal Histories of the Universe.
As mentioned above, this talk revolved around dark matter as well,
though from a particle theory perspective. The trick in particle physics
is always making sure that your solution to one problem, in this case
dark matter, does not interfere with our solution to another problem.
The other problem here was the baryon asymmetry, or the overabundance of
matter compared with antimatter in the universe. In particle physics the
two are generally sides of the same coin and we have no reason to prefer
one or the other, and so we must have some reason that we only observe
regular matter in the universe. There is a well-established model for
this, called nucleosynthesis, and now when we explain the amount of dark
matter in the universe we have to keep from interfering with it. And
while we're at it, we might solve a third problem - why is the density
of dark matter and regular matter in the universe on the same order of
magnitude? Sinha went through this, presenting two models of baryon
genesis, occurring at different times in the history of the universe,
each with their own features problems. Finally, he suggested one
solution to the coincidence problem that is non-thermal - that is,
rather than configuring the equilibrium point of matter and dark matter
to be similar separately, we have them coming from the same source with
similar decay rate. And that was that for last week, as dark matter
obscures the better-lit one. This week have a sweeping overview of
particle physics, toric singularities on branes, and possibly some news
from the LHC. See you in seven.</p>

                    <p><em>I thought we could spice things up a bit with a more interactive post
on The Virtuosi. Starting this week, a new problem of the week will be
posted each week. Solutions will be posted the following week. These
problems will be a collection of physics and math problems and riddles,
and although hopefully challenging enough to be fun and interesting,
they should mostly be solvable using concepts from introductory
undergraduate physics and math classes.</em>
<em>We welcome you to ponder these problems, and send in solutions, or even
any ideas you have about how to solve the problems
to</em><a href="mailto:the.physics.virtuosi@gmail.com"><em>the.physics.virtuosi@gmail.com</em></a><em>with
“problem of the week” in the subject line. We will keep track of the top
Virtuosi problem solvers.</em>
<em>Here it goes…<strong><em>Maximizing Gravity</em>*
</strong>
You are given a blob of Play-Doh (with a fixed mass and uniform density)
that you can shape however you choose. How can you shape it to maximize
the gravitational force at a given point </em>P* on the surface of the
Play-Doh?
Solution
In cylindrical coordinates, where the point P is taken to be the origin,
the z-component of the gravitational field due to any point (s, z) felt
at the origin, is proportional to
$$\frac{1}{s^{2}+z^{2}}\frac{z}{\sqrt{s^{2}+z^{2}}},$$
where the second factor is necessary to take the z-component. If we have
azimuthal symmetry, the magnitude of the gravitational field is given by
the sum of all the z-components of the forces due to all points in the
planet. For a given contour
$$\frac{z}{\left(s^{2}+z^{2}\right)^{3/2}}=C,$$
<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_kdZd6FJQtZQ/TN9Jgv8f9gI/AAAAAAAAAAM/qdRknJVbCT0/s1600/maxgravity.jpg"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_kdZd6FJQtZQ/TN9Jgv8f9gI/AAAAAAAAAAM/qdRknJVbCT0/s320/maxgravity.jpg"></a>
for some constant C, each point on the interior contributes more to the
total gravitational field than each point on the exterior. Thus, the
gravitational field is maximized if the surface of the planet takes the
shape of one of these contours. Solving for s(z), we
get$$s\left(z\right)=\sqrt{\left(\frac{z}{C}\right)^{2/3}-z^{2}}.$$
If the length of the planet in the z-direction is $$z_0,$$ we can
replace C in the above expression to get
$$s\left(z\right)=\sqrt{\left(z_{0}^{4}z^{2}\right)^{1/3}-z^{2}}.$$
As can be seen by the plot above, this shape looks a lot like a sphere,
but slightly smushed toward the point of interest P. We can rigorously
compare the field of the maximal gravity solid to that of a sphere with
the same volume. The volume of the maximal solid is given by
$$V=\pi\int_{0}^{z_{0}}s^{2}\left(z\right)dz=\pi\int_{0}^{z_{0}}\left[\left(z_{0}^{4}z^{2}\right)^{1/3}-z^{2}\right]dz=\frac{4\pi}{15}z_{0}^{3}$$
The volume of a sphere of radius r is of course $$V=\frac{4}{3}\pi
r^{3},$$ so in order for the volumes to be the same, the sphere must
have a radius of $$r=z_{0}/5^{1/3}.$$
The acceleration due to the maximal solid is proportional to
$$a_{max}=\int dVa_{z}=2\pi
G\rho\int_{0}^{z_{0}}dz\int_{0}^{s\left(z\right)}sds\frac{z}{\left(s^{2}+z^{2}\right)^{3/2}}=\frac{4\pi
G\rho z_{0}}{5},$$
while the acceleration due to the sphere is just
$$a_{sphere}=\frac{G\rho\frac{4}{3}\pi r^{3}}{r^{2}}=\frac{4\pi
G\rho z_{0}}{3\cdot5^{1/3}}.$$
Thus, we have
$$\frac{F_{max}}{F_{sphere}}=\frac{4\pi G\rho z_{0}/5}{4\pi
G\rho
z_{0}/\left(3\cdot5^{1/3}\right)}=\frac{3}{5^{2/3}}\approx1.026.$$
So the solid that gives the maximum gravitational field at a point is
only about 3% better than a sphere.
