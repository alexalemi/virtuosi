    <p>The following is an unfinished manuscript found under heaps of rubble
and pizza boxes here at Virtuosi headquarters. It appears to be some
sort of screen play, though one would be hard-pressed to figure this out
solely from the script. The true giveaway was the 100 page addendum (not
published) full of potential titles and acceptance speeches. I dare not
bore you with these vanity pages in their entirety, but just for
completeness and posterity I include some samples.
For possible titles we have: "Dr. Dre, OR: How I Learned to Stop
Worrying and Love the Metric," "How to Teach Physics to your Dee Oh
Double G (West Coast Edition)," "Bring Da Ruckus: ODEs by ODB" and
"Flavor Flav's Flavor Physics...boooyeeeee!" among other even worse and
less relevant titles.
Among the acceptance speeches we have one that starts: "I would like to
thank the Academy, Scott Bakula and Chuck D. You know what you did.
Here's a song I wrote...", etc. It is all very painful.
There is almost no value to this document whatsoever, but it does
present a nice fun fact about GPS. The legible parts of the script are
thus presented below. The illegible parts appear to have been obscured
by some caustic mixture of Mountain Dew, pizza sauce and tears. <strong> <em>We
descend to the bottom of the abandoned mineshaft recently converted to
the headquarters of General Stanley K. Ripper. He is currently engaged
in a heated discussion with his science advisor, Dr. Vontavious Dre. We
join mid-sentence as a result of lazy writing...</em>
</strong>
<em>DR. DRE: ...shortage of scientists! What's that? Yeah, you could
definitely call it a "chronic" shortage if you want. But semantics
aren't important right now. The "G"-sector needs more funding.</em>
<strong>
<em>GEN. RIPPER: You are my most trusted science advisor, Dr. Dre, but you
already have one staff scientist...a Dr. Snoop Dogg, I believe...? How
many scientists do we need doing relativity here? This is the military!
We need Moonraker lasers and nuclear hand grenades. So no more funding
unless... That is, unless you figured out the...</em>
</strong>
<em>DR. DRE: No sir, we still don't have a Stargate.</em>
<strong>
<em>GEN. RIPPER: Well then you are just wasting my time! I want something
useful. Either something that goes boom or something that helps
something that goes boom. What I don't need is a theoretical money
drain.</em>
</strong>
<em>DR. DRE: And how did you find your way to work today, sir?</em>
<strong>
<strong><em>GEN. RIPPER: What? You know very well I ride my horse, Neigh-braham
Lincoln. He knows how to get here.</em>
</strong>
<em>DR. DRE: And how does Nifty 'Nabe know where to go...?</em>
</strong>
<em>GEN RIPPER: GPS, of course!</em>
<strong>
<em>DR. DRE: Bingo. That's our department. Without correcting for general
relativistic effects (the specialty of the "G"-sector, I may add), GPS
would be completely useless. Let me show you.</em>
</strong>
<em>A large blackboard drops down from the ceiling and a slow steady beat,
just barely audible, seems to come from all directions. Dre writes the
following equation on the board:</em>
$$ ds^2 = -\left(1-\frac{R_s}{r} \right)c^2dt^2+ \left( 1 -
\frac{R_s}{r} \right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 \left( d{\theta}^2 +
{\sin\theta} {d\phi}^2 \right)$$
This equation gives the line element for a Schwarzschild metric. The
R_s in the equation is called the "Schwarzschild Radius" and is given
by
$$ R_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2} .$$
GEN RIPPER: Is that Karl Schwarzschild? I remember reading a delightful
biography of him somewhere...? Anyway, what the heck is this "line
element" thing...?
DR. DRE: Good question. Essentially what we get is the differential
change in the space-time interval ( ds ) if we change all the
coordinates by a very tiny little bit. What is nice about this is that
although coordinates are a tricky thing in general relativity and can
change from one observer to another, the space-time interval is an
invariant quantity. That is, different observers will measure the same
space-time interval between events even though they may measure
different times and distances.
GEN RIPPER: So this space-time interval is just a kind of space-time
distance that different observers will agree on?
DR. DRE: Right-o. And this invariance allows us to compare different
reference frames. Eventually, we will use this invariance to get the
frequencies observed by an observer on the surface of the earth and one
traveling along with a satellite in orbit. Since we will only be
considering observers at fixed radius and fixed theta = 90 degrees (ie
at the equator), we can simplify things a bit. Since we will have a
fixed radius and theta value we have that:
$$ dr = 0 $$
$$ d\theta = 0 $$
and
$$\sin\theta = 1 $$
Plugging these simplifications into our line element gives:
$$ ds^2 = -\left( 1 - \frac{R_s}{r} \right)c^2 dt^2 + r^2
d\phi^2 $$
GEN RIPPER: Neato Toledo!
DR DRE: Right, so now we divide out the -c^2 dt^2 term on the right
hand side. So we have:
$$ ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 \left[ \left( 1 - \frac{R_s}{r} \right) -
\frac{r^2}{c^2} \frac{d\phi^2}{dt^2} \right] $$
But this is just $$ ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 \left[ \left( 1 -
\frac{R_s}{r} \right) - \frac{r^2}{c^2} {\left(\frac{d\phi}{dt}
\right)}^2 \right] $$
But what does that d phi / dt term look like?
GEN RIPPER: Sure looks like an angular velocity to me. But don't we need
to be careful with these rates?
DR. DRE: Yep, that is an angular velocity term. We need to be a little
careful with these rates. Essentially, in the coordinate system we have
chosen the time is something like the time measured at r = infinity and
thus the rate would also be measured from r = infinity. Plugging in
omega as our angular velocity, we now have:
$$ ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 \left[ \left( 1 - \frac{R_s}{r} \right)
-\left( \frac{r {\omega}}{c} \right)^2 \right] $$
But we want to figure out the times on the GPS satellites, so we'll need
some measure of how time ticks by as measured by the orbiting observer.
In the rest frame of the observer, we have that
$$ ds^2 = -c^2 {d\tau}^2 $$
where the tau is the "proper time" of the observer. It tells us the time
that the observer measures on his clocks. To find the frequency (in
other words, how quickly the observer clock ticks by a second) we just
have
$$ f = \frac{1}{d\tau} $$
And now we have enough background to start talking about GPS!
GEN RIPPER: Hooray! Should I go get my horse...?
DR. DRE: I don't think that's necessary...? Anyway, let's model our GPS
system as a satellite in a 26,000 km orbit [1]. Meanwhile our earth
reference frame will be an observer standing on the surface of the
earth. So let's write out our line element for each reference frame.
First the satellite frame:
<em>As Dr. Dre works, the beat steadily gets louder.</em>
$$ ds^2 = -c^2 {dt}^2 \left[ \left( 1 - \frac{R_s}{R_{sat}}
\right) -{\left( \frac{\omega_{sat} R_{sat}}{c} \right)}^2
\right] $$
So the frequency at which a satellite clock ticks is
$$ f_{sat} = \frac{1}{dt} \left[ \left( 1 - \frac{R_s}{R_{sat}}
\right) -{\left(\frac{\omega_{sat} R_{sat}}{c} \right)}^2
\right]}^{-1/2} $$ and likewise the earth frame:
$$ ds^2 = -c^2 {dt}^2 \left[ \left( 1 - \frac{R_s}{R_{earth}}
\right) -{\left(\frac{\omega_{earth} R_{earth}}{c} \right)}^2
\right] $$
So the frequency at which an earth clock ticks is
$$ f_{earth} = \frac{1}{dt} \left[ \left( 1 -
\frac{R_s}{R_{earth}} \right) -{\left( \frac{\omega_{earth}
R_{earth}}{c} \right)}^2 \right]}^{-1/2} $$
Taking the ratio of these frequencies tells us how quickly the satellite
clocks tick relative to the earth clocks. We get:
$$ \frac{f_{sat}}{f_{earth}} = {\left[ \frac{\left( 1 -
\frac{R_s}{R_{earth}} \right) -{\left( \frac{\omega_{earth}
R_{earth}}{c} \right)}^2 }{\left( 1 - \frac{R_s}{R_{sat}}
\right) -{\left( \frac{\omega_{sat} R_{sat}}{c} \right)}^2 }
\right]}^{1/2} $$
And we're done. So what do we get? Let's plug in some numbers:
$$ r_{sat} = 26 \times 10^6 m $$
$$ R_{earth} = 6.3 \times 10^6 m$$
$$\omega_{earth} = 7.3 \times 10^{-5} rad/s $$
$$\omega_{sat}=\sqrt{\frac{GM}{{r_{sat}}^3}}=15 \times 10^{-5}
rad/s $$
$$ c = 3 \times 10^8 m/s $$
We can also find the Schwarzschild radius of the Earth to be
$$ R_s = 8.9 mm $$
Now you still have that fancy calculator, right General? Can you plug
all this stuff in there and tell me what you get?
<em>General Ripper works diligently on the calculator for a few minutes,
then shows the calculator to Dr. Dre.</em>
<strong>
DR. DRE: "01134"..? No that can't be correct. Did you plug in the values
I ... ?
<em>General, with a wry smile, turns the calculator upside down and shows
Dr. Dre.</em>
</strong>
DR. DRE: Ah, well "hello" to you to sir. GEN. RIPPER: And I've got
another! Now where's that eight key...? DR. DRE: I guess I'll just do
the math in my head...
<em>The background beat, which had just reached a crescendo immediately
drops out as Dre thinks</em>. <em>Then comes right back in as he begins to
speak again...</em>
<strong>
Alright, I got that
$$\frac{f_{sat}}{f_{earth}} = 1 + 4.4 \times 10^{-10} $$
From this we see that the satellite clock ticks faster (i.e. at a higher
frequency) than does the earth clock. The difference is very very small.
For every second that ticks by on earth, we see that the difference in
the earth and satellite clocks increases by 4.4 * 10^{-10} seconds.
GEN RIPPER: But we are talking about half a billionth of a second!
There's no way that can do much harm.
DR. DRE: Well remember, that's per second. So over the course of a day
(86,400 s), the satellite has picked up 38 microseconds. But that
corresponds to
$$ d = c \times t = ( 3 \times 10^8 m/s ) \times ( 38 \times
10^{-6} s ) = 11 km $$
So without correcting for general relativity, GPS systems would be off
by 11 km per day!
GEN RIPPER: I am impressed! Here's millions of dollars in funding!
Hooray!
DR. DRE: Hooray!
<em>Dr. Dre and General Ripper jump up and give each other a mid-air high
five. We freeze-frame this scene and</em>"Don't You Forget About Me" <em>plays
as the credits roll.</em>
</strong>
<em>THE END (?)</em> <strong> </strong> [1] Thanks to Tom from <a href="http://blogs.scienceforums.net/swansont/">Swans on
Tea</a> (one of my favorite
physics blogs) for fixing a mistake for me. I had initially done the
calculation assuming the satellite was in a geosynchronous orbit (about
42,000 km) and got a time delay of 48 microseconds. As it turns out, the
GPS satellites are really at an orbit of about 26,000 km, which gives a
time delay of 38 microseconds. I have made the appropriate changes and
the calculations now reflect this more accurate value.

    <p>Hi everybody, I'm Sam, and this will be my first contribution to the
blog! (cue applause) It will not be a physical modeling exercise;
instead I will be writing a little bit about about paradigm shifts in a
series of a few posts. I hope it will provoke some interesting
discussion. "But Sam," you ask, "Isn't 'paradigm shift' just a buzzword
that people use to sound important?" Well, maybe, but it's also useful
phrase used to describe a substantial change in the way something is
done. Consider, for example, THE METRIC SYSTEM (many details from
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system">Wikipedia</a>)
<a href="http://www.debateitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/metric-system.jpg"><img alt="image" src="http://www.debateitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/metric-system.jpg"></a>
In 1791, in the wake of revolution, France became the first country to
adopt the recently developed metric system. Since then, every nation in
the world has officially adopted the metric system except Liberia,
Burma, and the United States. It is the standard measurement system for
most physical science, even in the US (as far as I know, no other unit
system even has a measurement for quantities like electric field or
magnetic field) (also, when I say metric, I of course include cgs and
mks and ignore systems that are not meant for measurement, like natural
units and Planck units). It has the advantages of easy unit conversion
(1 km = 1000 m vs 1 mile = 5280 ft, a value which I had to look up from
<a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/09/remembering-two-things.html">Yariv's
post</a>),
and lack of ambiguity in units (mass = kg, force = N vs mass = lbs_mass
or stones, force = lbs_force). The strong preference of scientists for
the metric system is evident from past experiences: From
<a href="http://www.cnn.com/TECH/space/9909/30/mars.metric.02/">CNN</a>, September
1999: "NASA lost a $125 million Mars orbiter because a Lockheed Martin
engineering team used English units of measurement while the agency's
team used the more conventional metric system for a key spacecraft
operation" This story also illustrates the equally strong preference of
engineers for the English system. Ah, and herein lies the problem. You
see, when the metric system was first adopted in Europe, it created a
standardized unit system. This proved useful to merchants selling their
wares by weight, but more relevant to myself as a scientist, it provided
a means for creating scientific recipes, for providing the utterly
essential aspect of reproducibility to scientific experiments. However,
now the standardization exists even with the English system, given a
simple unit conversion. But why not adopt the metric system to avoid
situations like the Mars orbiter and make me less confused when I cross
the border to Canada and see speed limit signs telling me to do 80?
<em>Because it would be too huge of a paradigm shift</em>. Allow me to
illustrate my point.
One of the most (if not the most) strongly affected groups by a change
in measurement systems is manufacturers, ie people who make stuff. I
will use a typical example of a manufacturer, the kind who I interact
with in my lab: the noble machinist (keep in mind that machinists are
very important, as they are required to make many, many products). If
you have ever worked with a machinist in the states, chances are he or
she will be totally confused if you try to give them dimensions in
millimeters (I have done this, and they weren't very happy with me
because it meant they had to convert all the dimensions I gave them into
English). It would be extremely difficult to retrain people who have
used the English system all their lives. It would be like learning a new
language. Inevitably, it would cause a large number of mistakes. More
significantly, they would have to get ENTIRELY new equipment. Every
machine shop would have to completely replace their tools (drill bits,
screwdrivers, wrenches etc) and materials (standardized sizes of bolts,
nuts, sheet and bulk material, pipes, connectors, cables, etc etc). You
could say, "Come on, it wouldn't be so bad! Listen, we could gradually
phase out the old English equipment and just make everything in metric
from now on!" However, I would counter that this is not a realistic
plan. For starters, there's the problem of having to keep around two
sets of equipment (one for the old English stuff and one for the new
metric stuff), which would require double the space and double the
maintenance. Second, there would be compatibility issues between new and
old equipment (e.g. my old 3/4" ipod port wouldn't mate with my new 2 cm
connector). Third, the previous two problems would likely be around for
a long time, considering the age of some of the equipment that I've seen
in labs and elsewhere.
And I haven't even mentioned the economics. If basic parts manufacturers
(the people who make the screws, the bolts, and the sheet metal that
will later be made into products) began to offer metric parts (now that
I think about it, maybe they already do?), I doubt anybody would buy
them. It would cost them too much to replace all their machinery
infrastructure. There would be no market for them. Maybe you would then
ask "Well, what if the government made everybody switch to metric?"
Well, other than the backlash this would cause towards whichever
administration suggested this, it would likely hurt and maybe even
bankrupt companies who were forced to switch. As far as I can tell, it
would definitely hurt the US economy in the short term (but it might
help other countries who could sell their metric wares here) and not
help it at all in the long term. To me, the economic loss (not to
mention the difficulty in convincing the US population to swallow the
change) outweighs the advantages of switching. At this point, exhausted
from my challenging you at every turn, you may finally say, "Well hey,
SPEAKING of Canada, they changed to the metric system only in 1973. How
did THEY do it??" The answer is that, well, they didn't. Not entirely
anyway. Sure, the country may package food and make road signs in metric
(which the US could probably do, if people could somehow be convinced to
go along with it), but in fact their engineering materials, which mostly
come from the states, are still in English units. Even Canada couldn't
justify completely converting to the metric system Which just goes to
show how difficult it is to pull off a paradigm shift. Next time, I'll
present an example of a paradigm shift that I think COULD work.</p>

    <p>One of my professors, <a href="http://www.physics.cornell.edu/people/faculty/?page=website/faculty&amp;action=show/id=80" title="who is now mentioned in two blogs in this context">Yuval
Grossman</a>,
was talking about the zoology of particle physics in class the other
day. Trying to get us to remember such trivia as the mass of the B
meson, he noted that it's easier to remember two things than it is to
remember one - and as it happens, the mass of the B meson is about 5280
MeV, which is also the length of a mile in feet (an equally obscure
piece of trivia, if you ask me). This reminded of one of my first
calculus classes back home where another professor (Mikhail Sodin)
chided us for not knowing the value of e, 2.71828. This is easy to
remember, he said because 1828 is the year Lev Tolstoy was born. Then
again, when I came to write this post, I could neither remember e, nor
Tolstoy's year of birth - or even that it was Tolstoy, rather than
Dostoevsky or some other Russian author. So perhaps two things are not
easier to remember than one after all.</p>

There's an age old question that mankind has pondered. I'm sure that
noble heads such as Aristotle, Newton, and Einstein have pondered it. I
myself have raised it a few times. The question is: do you get more wet
running or walking through the rain? Now, I know that this question was
<a href="http://mythbustersresults.com/episode38">mythbusted</a> a while back. So
this is one of those situations where I know the result I want to get to
with my calculation: according to mythbusters running is better. Still,
I think formulating the question mathematically will be fun, plus if I
fail to agree with experiment everyone can mock me mercilessly. I'll
begin by stating a few assumptions. I'm going to assuming that the rain
is falling straight down, at a constant rate. I'm also going to assume
that if we are standing still, only our head and shoulders get wet, not
our front or back. With those in place, lets start by formulating the
expression for how wet we would get if we stood still. Well, take
$$\Delta W_{top} - \text{the change in water (in liters) on a person}
$$ $$\rho - \text{the density of water in the air in liters per cubic
meter}$$ $$A_t - \text{top area of a person}$$ $$\Delta t -
\text{time elapsed}$$ Intuition suggests that the rate at which
raindrops hit our top, times the area of our top, times the time we
stand in the rain, will give us the change in water. In an equation, $$
\Delta W_{top} = \rho A_t v_r \Delta t $$ Note that whatever
expression we generate for how wet we get when moving will have to
reduce to this form in the limit that we're not moving. This will be a
good check for us. Next, we need to define a few additional measures:
$$d - \text{distance we have to travel in the rain}$$
$$v_r - \text{raindrop velocity}$$
$$A_f - \text{front area of a person}$$
$$W_{tot} - \text{total amount of water in liters we get hit with} $$
Well, no mater how fast we run the rain will keep hitting us on the top
of our heads, so we're going to have our standing still term, plus
another term for how much hits us when running. How do we consider that?
Well, when we run, we're cutting into the swath of rainy air in front of
ourselves. We'll get hit on our frontside by all the additional
raindrops in that stretch we carve out. Mathematically, if we travel
some distance delta x in a time delta t, we'll get hit with an
additional amount of water
$$ \Delta W = \rho A_f \Delta x $$
$$ \Delta W = \rho A_f v \Delta t $$
We combine our two terms to get
$$\Delta W_{tot} = \rho \Delta t (A_t v_r + A_f v)$$
Note that if we stop walking (v goes to zero) we'll return to our
stationary expression. Next I'll take the delta t over to the other
side, turn that into a derivative, and integrate to get the total water
hitting us, not just the change for some delta t. Of course, since
everything else in the equation is constant, this is the equivalent of
dropping the deltas,
$$W_{tot} = \rho (A_t v_r + A_f v) t $$
$$W_{tot} = \rho (A_t v_r + A_f v)\frac{d}{v}$$
$$W_{tot}= \rho d (A_t \frac{v_r}{v} + A_f)$$
where I substituted t = d/v, and did some simplification. Now, lets look
at the qualitative features of this result. First, we have two terms, a
constant and a term that depends inversely on the velocity of motion.
This means that the faster we go, the less wet we get (I'll plot this in
a bit), but also that there's a threshold wetness you cannot avoid. This
threshold represents the amount of rain in a human sized channel between
where you start and where you end. Also note that as velocity goes to
zero, i.e. we stop moving, how wet we get goes to infinity. That is, if
we're going to stand in the rain forever we're going to keep getting
wet. What is the term in 1/v? It's the amount of rain that hits you on
the top of your head! So what we've derived is that for a fixed distance
how wet you get on the front is fixed, and by moving faster you can make
less rain hit you on the top of your head.
Now, lets figure out what some reasonable numbers are, and plot this
function. A few months back when discussion <a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/05/human-radiation.html">human
radiation</a>
I estimated my area as a cylinder with a height of 1.8 m and a radius of
.14 m. This gives a top area of A_t = .06 m^2 and a front cross
section area (note, this is not the cylinder area, but my cross section
that will be exposed to the rain!) of .5 m^2. As for raindrop velocity,
well in my <a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/04/falling-water-hot-or-cold.html">first
post</a>
on this blog I calculated the terminal velocity of what I described as a
medium sized raindrop as 6 m/s, and since water drops reach that while
going over niagara falls, we can assume that our raindrops are falling
at terminal velocity.
Finally, I need to estimate the water density. In a medium-to-heavy rain
I would say it takes about 45 s to get a sidewalk square totally wet.
Let's assume a raindrop wets an area of sidewalk equal to twice the
cross section of the raindrop. I used a raindrop of 1.5mm radius, so
that's 7<em>10^-6 m^2 cross section. Now, a sidewalk square is about 2/3
m x 2/3m (about 2 ft x 2ft), so we need \~32000 drops! The volume of a
1.5mm drop is 1.4^-8 m^3, so we have a volume of 4.5</em>10^-4 m^3 =
.45 liters. Now, take our stationary expression from above. This allows
us to solve for \rho. Set delta W equal to .45 liters and substitute
the rest of the numbers we've generated.
$$ \frac{\Delta W_{top}}{A_t v_r \Delta t}= \rho $$
$$ \rho = \frac{.45 liters}{(.44 m^2)( 6 m/s )(45 s)} = .004
liters/m^3 $$
We've found our water density, .004 liters/m^3. Having done this, we
can plug numbers into our final equation above and find
$$W_{tot}= d (\frac{(.001 liters/s)}{v} + .002 liters/m)$$
This scales linearly with distance, so lets pick something reasonable,
say 100m, and if you want the result for another other distance just
scale the results appropriately. Thus
$$W_{tot}= (\frac{(.1 liters\text{*}m/s)}{v} + .2 liters)$$
Finally we can plot this.</p>

  Plot of how wet you get vs. how fast you run. The blue line is the actual curve and the red line is the theoretical least wet asymptote.</p>
<hr>
<p>I've chosen .5 m/s (\~1mph, a meander) and 11 m/s (slightly faster than
the world record for the 100m dash) as my starting and ending points on
the velocity. The blue line is the curve I calculated, and the red line
represents the theoretical minimum, the 'wetness threshold' if you will.
So you see that if you are Usain Bolt, you can reduce how wet you get by
almost a factor of two by going from a meander to a sprint!
Now, there's more I could say about this (what if the rain isn't coming
straight down? What is my best speed if I have an umbrella?), but I
think that's enough for tonight. I've come out with a theoretically
satisfying result that concurs with experiment. Anytime that happens
that's a good day for the theorists.</p>

  Matt and Jared standing on our experiment</p>
<hr>
<p>When you strike a bell, it rings at a given frequency. This frequency is
called the resonant frequency and is the natural frequency at which the
bell likes to ring. Just about anything that can shake, rattle, or
oscillate will have a resonant frequency. Things like quartz crystals,
wine glasses, and suspension bridges all have a resonant frequency. The
quartz crystals oscillate at frequencies high enough for accurate
timekeeping in watches, the wine glasses at audible frequencies to make
boring dinners more interesting, and bridges at low enough frequencies
that you can feel it when you walk. It is the resonant frequency of
bridges that we decided to measure.
To make our measurements, we "borrowed" Yariv's fancy phone. One of the
nice things about fancy new phones is that most of them have internal
accelerometers to detect motion. You can do a whole bunch of fun
experiments and take some pretty good data with these accelerometers
(see, for example, physicist and TV star Rhett Allain's posts over at
<a href="http://scienceblogs.com/dotphysics/iphone/">dot physics</a>). Placing
Yariv's phone on the suspension footbridge on campus, Alemi, Matt and I
took data and confused passers-by for about 15 minutes. The
accelerometer in the phone measures acceleration in three coordinate
directions: x is along the width of the bridge, y is along the length of
the bridge, and z is up and down. The raw data is shown below. The z
data is shown in blue, and x and y in green and red.
<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TGNrbHEsuvI/AAAAAAAAAGA/4WyG8OuNww0/s1600/bridge_rawtime.png"><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TGNrbHEsuvI/AAAAAAAAAGA/4WyG8OuNww0/s400/bridge_rawtime.png"></a>
The first thing you'll notice about this data is that the z direction
(blue) has big spikes in it around 180s, 300s, and 800s. The biggest
spikes are when Alemi and I jumped up and down to ring the bridge. The
smaller bumps in the blue data are the result of people walking or
jogging by.
With the raw acceleration data and knowledge of the sample rate of the
accelerometer ( 90 Hz ), we can Fourier transform it to get frequencies.
Doing this to the raw data for each dimension we get the following
spectrograms. Each of the spectrograms illustrates how much of each
frequency is present at each point in time.
The most relevant direction for us is the z direction. We see that at
several points there are strong signals at all frequencies followed by
longer periods where the main signal is around 1 Hz. These events
correspond to when Alemi and I jumped up and down and are analogous to
ringing a bell. The striking of the bell is just a sharp impulse
(roughly a delta function) which is composed of all frequencies. Soon
after the impulse, all of the frequencies die out except for the
resonant frequency, which keeps on ringing. Just looking at this graph,
it looks like the bridge resonant frequency is around 1 Hz.
<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TGNvFsSzqGI/AAAAAAAAAGI/m2Tr3GwM1qM/s1600/bridge_Zspec.png"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TGNvFsSzqGI/AAAAAAAAAGI/m2Tr3GwM1qM/s400/bridge_Zspec.png"></a>
We can also make similar graphs for the x and y directions. Remember,
the x direction is the width of the bridge and the y direction is the
length of the bridge. Although there is less motion in these directions,
the spikes where we jumped and people walked by are still clearly
visible.
<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TGNxb8WcJMI/AAAAAAAAAGY/tLPA6SbyyeE/s1600/bridge_Xspec.png"><img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TGNxb8WcJMI/AAAAAAAAAGY/tLPA6SbyyeE/s400/bridge_Xspec.png"></a>

Finally, we can find out how much of a particular frequency is in the
whole signal. To do this we take find the power spectrum density of the
entire data set (blue is z, green is x and red is y). The ringdown
frequency of about 1 Hz we saw in the spectrograms above after the jumps
is illustrated in this graph as the first blue peak. There are also some
other peaks at around 15 Hz, 25 Hz and 35 Hz. I am not sure what they
correspond to.
<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TGNyNOZDLEI/AAAAAAAAAGg/a3eLidFVn3Y/s1600/bridge_psd.png"><img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TGNyNOZDLEI/AAAAAAAAAGg/a3eLidFVn3Y/s400/bridge_psd.png"></a>
To clean up this a bit, we can just take the data without the jumps in
it. Computing a new power spectrum density with just the data from about
400s - 700s, we get the following graph, which also displays a fairly
prominent peak around 1 Hz.
<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TGcYbMuUbTI/AAAAAAAAAGo/v2d2bMQNsoE/s1600/psd.png"><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fa6AZDCsHnY/TGcYbMuUbTI/AAAAAAAAAGo/v2d2bMQNsoE/s400/psd.png"></a>
So it seems that there is definitely something going on around 1 Hz.
Initially, I was worried that this is just the rate at which people walk
and therefore it was just showing up because we had people walking the
whole time. However, the strong 1 Hz signal after each ringing in each z
spectrogram seems to indicate that it is intrinsic to the bridge.
Therefore, it seems as though the resonant frequency in the z direction
of the bridge is about 1 Hz. But don't take our word for it. If you want
to do your own analysis, you can find the raw data

<p>Yesterday we rode down Ithaca's hills in an attempt to estimate the
terminal velocity of a bike rider braving the city's potholes. But
estimations are easy, and we relied on a number of factors - the drag
coefficient and area of the bicyclist, in particular - to get them. To
see how well we did, it's time to move on to the experimental portion
this exercise. Our tools? My bike (figure 1), and my beloved
accelerometer (figure 2), with Google's <a href="http://mytracks.appspot.com/">My

measuring both the speed and elevation as a function of time. I came up
with a lot of noisy data, some of it useful and a lot of it not. A
typical plot out of the software looks something like (figure 3); out of
those I identified moments of what seemed to be free acceleration, where
I was not applying the brakes. I then calculated the slope and the
acceleration at each point by subtracting subsequent measurements; this
resulted in much noisier data, as seen on (figure 4).</p>

<p>The next question was what to fit these graphs to. I can't compare
directly to the formula I had for terminal velocity, since I don't
believe I achieve it at any point and we never see the velocity graph
plateau. What we do have is the formula for the acceleration, which
depends on both the angle and the velocity: $$ a = g\sin\theta -
\frac{1}{2}\frac{\rho A C_d}{m} v^2. $$ It's a little hard to plot
three-dimensional surfaces like this, but I can try to plot the
acceleration as a function of the velocity squared. Assuming that the
slope of each of my routes is constant and that they are both different,
this should give me two straight lines offset by a constant. Seen in
(figure 5), this yields less than optimal result. A first correction
would be to account for the differing slope at different measurement
points. Once we do that the data looks a little more linear, and we can
fit a line through it, as seen in (figure 6).</p>

6: Adjusted for slope and fitted</p>
<p>The fits are given by: $$ a = (1.022 \rm{m}) - (0.00427 \rm{1/m})
v^2\;\; \rm{(University)} $$ $$ a = (1.465 \rm{m}) - (0.00572
\rm{1/m}) v^2\;\; \rm{(State)} $$ and we can quickly extract the
terminal velocity out of the coefficients to get a factor of 47.9 m/s
for the first line and 41.4 m/s for the second. These both fall within
20% of our initial estimate, which is quite satisfying considering how
bad the data looks. A few final thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is the data so noisy? I can think of a lot of reasons. My Droid
    phone is not quite a scientific measuring device to begin with, and
    we did some numerical derivation of the initial data we got from it.
    On top of that, the way I sit on the bike, the weight of the bag I
    carry with me and other factors like the wind changed from ride to
    ride.</li>
<li>I tried to avoid biasing the analysis and I was quite relieved when
    the final numbers came out so close to my original estimate. I did
    play around a little with a different presentation that didn't look
    linear at all, but other than that I think what I did was pretty
    straightforward.</li>
<li>The one thing that I don't like about the final results is the
    constant addition to both acceleration fits, or put another way, the
    fact that after subtracting the gravitational pull from the
    acceleration I still get positive numbers, while the drag force
    should work to reduce it. I suspect this implies that my
    cancellation of the sinθ term was less than perfect.</li>
<li>Can you figure out what the trajectory the bike as a function of
    time looks like? There's a (non-trivial) analytic expression.</li>

<p>The impetus for this post lies with three facts. First, I like to bike
to work. Second, Cornell sits on a
<a href="http://www.cornell.edu/search/index.cfm?tab=facts&amp;q=&amp;id=272">hill</a>. And
finally, I'm not very brave. As a result of all of these, along with
Ithaca's less-than-optimal road maintenance, my semi-daily rides home
tend to produce a lot of wear on my brakes as I cruise downhill at what
appears to me to be very high speeds. I began to ponder just how high
this speed really is, and if I could reduce my use of the brakes or if
I'm going to end up using them anyway at the bottom of the hill.

<p>Figure 1: An inclined plane</p>
<p>So, I asked myself, what do I remember about bikes going down the hill?
Well, I remember the good old inclined plane (figure 1), and I remember
that air resistance is proportional to velocity, so that the equation of
motion is given by $$ ma = mg\sin\theta - \alpha v. $$ I had no idea
what α was, though. My first stop in considering it was naturally
Wikipedia. A quick
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_velocity">search</a> came up with
the formula $$m a = mg\sin\theta - \frac{1}{2}\rho A C_d v^2$$
where ρ is the density of air, A the projected area of the body and C~d~
the drag coefficient The first thing to notice here is that I was wrong
- drag in a fluid acts like the velocity squared, and not the velocity.
Second, we can easily determine terminal velocity out of this formula -
it's the speed at which the sum of the forces equals to zero, or $$v_t
= \sqrt{\frac{2mg\sin\theta}{\rho A C_d}}.$$ We can throw in some
numbers into that. ρ = 1.2 kg/m^3^ for air; Wikipedia estimates C~d~ =
0.9 for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_coefficient">cyclist</a>. For
the mass, we need to add up mine (\~75 kg), the bike's (15-20 kg) and my
bag's (let's say 5 kg). We come to about 100 kg, give or take 5%. A is a
little harder to estimate, but height times width gives me an initial
guess of 0.62 m^2^, which I'll revise to 0.7 m^2^ to account for the
bike, flailing arms and fashionable helmet, up to about 10% accuracy.
We're left with sinθ, which varies by road, but in general we expect the
terminal velocity to look like $$v_t \approx \left(50 \pm 3
\rm{m/s}\right) \sqrt{\sin\theta}.$$ This appears not-unreasonable.
For an 8% grade like we have down University avenue this yields about 50
km/h and for a 13% grade like we have down Buffalo street this will
bring us up to a respectable 65

Both, incidentally, are faster than I'm willing to go down a badly
maintained, not entire straight road. So we have some numbers, and I
begin to feel justified about pressing those breaks often, but all of
this is really an introduction for the next post, in which I go against
all my theorist instincts and take some data in the field. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>You may remember <a href="http://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2010/05/memorial-day-distractions.html">when I
invited</a>
everyone to play <a href="http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~aalemi/blotto/index.php">my
webform</a>
version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel_Blotto">Colonel
Blotto</a>. Well, its still up
and has been up for some time, but hasn't seen any action for a while so
I thought it might be time to take a look at the results. Colonel Blotto
is an interesting game. It seems to me, that much of this interest
derives from the fact that how well your strategy performs is very much
a function of which strategies exist in the pool. There is not a clear
cut winning strategy, you need to feel out the existing pool and adapt
accordingly. So to stir things up a little bit, in what follows I will
share some data from the existing database, refraining myself from
commenting too much. Basically, stay tuned for a bunch of pretty
pictures which will hopefully get your gears turning. The game is still
up, feel free to try to game it now that this information is out. Might
be interesting to see what kind of effect releasing the leaderboard will
have on the leaderboard.</p>
<h4>Leader Board</h4>
<p>347 Strategies were submitted since the game went live. Lets try and
take a look at what kind of strategies were submitted. Below are the top
25 ranking strategies in the database as of yesterday, along with the
actual strategy, its points, and full record.</p>

<h4>Soldier Distribution</h4>
<p>Next, lets try and take a look at all the strategies at once. Lets start
with the soldier distributions among the different slots. I will remind
you that the rules of the game are slot independent, i.e. if machines
were trying to play this game against one another you would expect the
soldier distribution to be more or less uniform between slots, any
deviation from uniformity probably says something deep and profound
about how humans think.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrK2Sfe9zI/AAAAAAAAAM4/OTL-Nzonw54/s1600/soldierdistbox.png"><img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrK2Sfe9zI/AAAAAAAAAM4/OTL-Nzonw54/s400/soldierdistbox.png"></a></p>
<p>Above is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_and_whisker">box and whiskers
plot</a> of all strategies,
looking at the number of soldiers in each slot.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFsIEnlnYPI/AAAAAAAAAOA/RjihpzKWRf0/s1600/soldierdist.png"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFsIEnlnYPI/AAAAAAAAAOA/RjihpzKWRf0/s400/soldierdist.png"></a></p>
<p>This plot is fun. It shows the full distribution of all of the
strategies. I went through the database, and for every strategy, added
one to the box that held true. I.e. for each slot (the slots are along
the x axis), the y axis marks how many strategies in the database have
that many soldiers in that slot. Should be fun to try and think about
what the non-uniformities mean. Colorbar is on the side to make the
colors quantitative.</p>
<h4>Point Distribution</h4>
<p>So, how well do all of the strategies do... lets take a look.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrKwJ2wATI/AAAAAAAAAMw/Zm9oCju3964/s1600/pointshist.png"><img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrKwJ2wATI/AAAAAAAAAMw/Zm9oCju3964/s400/pointshist.png"></a></p>
<p>Above is a histogram of all the scores for all the strategies in the
database. It has some interesting features. Definitely not singly
peaked. What do you think is going on on the far left?</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFsILm1CC9I/AAAAAAAAAOI/jJrgQA3xe4E/s1600/scoredist.png"><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFsILm1CC9I/AAAAAAAAAOI/jJrgQA3xe4E/s400/scoredist.png"></a></p>
<p>In this plot, I again went through all of the strategies in the
database, and this time, every square reflects the average score for all
strategies that have that many soldiers (y axis) in that slot (x axis).</p>
<h4>Strategies Layout</h4>
<p>Lets drill down a bit and look at how each strategy performs.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrK_cjwa6I/AAAAAAAAANA/TM0z0lXeoMA/s1600/winvlossesareatie.png"><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrK_cjwa6I/AAAAAAAAANA/TM0z0lXeoMA/s400/winvlossesareatie.png"></a></p>
<p>This scatter plot has a point for each strategy in the database, the x
coordinate giving its number of wins, the y coordinate its number of
losses. The area of the circle is scaled to its number of ties, and the
color is scaled to its total score. Is there a clear trend? Why does it
fan out?</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLG9Jz7EI/AAAAAAAAANI/dGD2srkuJjw/s1600/winvtiearea.png"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLG9Jz7EI/AAAAAAAAANI/dGD2srkuJjw/s400/winvtiearea.png"></a></p>
<p>Similar plot as above but this time, x coordinate is Wins, Y is ties,
size is losses and color score.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLL825x5I/AAAAAAAAANQ/ihuUuyOmoH4/s1600/lossesvtie.png"><img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLL825x5I/AAAAAAAAANQ/ihuUuyOmoH4/s400/lossesvtie.png"></a></p>
<p>One more, this time x coordinate is losses, y is ties, color is score.</p>
<h4>Fitness Landscapes</h4>
<p>So, what should you do if you wanted to design a winning strategy? Lets
first take a look at the fitness landscape. Now, this is difficult to do
for the whole game, with 10 slots and something like 40 reasonable
choices for each, this is some huge 10 dimensional space, which is
difficult to visualize, so instead lets take a look at the fitness
landscape for some lower dimensional cuts.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLR8oPRhI/AAAAAAAAANY/nVG1t0uisq4/s1600/energy456matshowjet.png"><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLR8oPRhI/AAAAAAAAANY/nVG1t0uisq4/s400/energy456matshowjet.png"></a></p>
<p>So in the above plot, what I've done is constructed a whole bunch of
strategies. First I started with 8 soldiers in all slots but the ones
listed in the title, namely slots 4,5,6 (starting with 1). So with only
3 slots free, and with the constraint that we have to have 100 soldiers
total, I can parametrize a whole bunch of strategies with only two
numbers, in this case the number of soldiers in slot 5 (x axis) and slot
6 (y axis). The color represents the score that the resulting strategy
has when run against all of the previously existing strategies in the
database. This was created without adding all of these strategies to the
database itself as that would have changed the results.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLVmy2N3I/AAAAAAAAANg/zID_NyC00Q0/s1600/energy568matshowjet.png"><img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLVmy2N3I/AAAAAAAAANg/zID_NyC00Q0/s400/energy568matshowjet.png"></a></p>
<p>Similar plot, this time changing the soldiers in slots 5,6 and 8 with x
axis the number of soldiers in slot 6 and the y axis the number of
soldiers in slot 8.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLZDDNo1I/AAAAAAAAANo/beYQagxYO6A/s1600/energy123matshowjet.png"><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLZDDNo1I/AAAAAAAAANo/beYQagxYO6A/s400/energy123matshowjet.png"></a></p>
<p>Another one, hopefully my labels make enough sense now that I don't have
to spell it out. I think this one has an interesting shape. What's going
on?</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLcW834jI/AAAAAAAAANw/Opwx0CqiqBs/s1600/energy127matshowjet.png"><img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLcW834jI/AAAAAAAAANw/Opwx0CqiqBs/s400/energy127matshowjet.png"></a></p>
<p>One more.</p>
<h4>Random Strategies</h4>
<p>So, lets say you are trying to construct winning strategies. The first
thing you might try to do is construct random strategies, by randomly
dropping 100 soldiers each into one of the slots at random. Doing so and
running these strategies against the database I got an idea of how
effective that would be.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLiuvLW-I/AAAAAAAAAN4/X-RmiGeA7R4/s1600/randomhist.png"><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFrLiuvLW-I/AAAAAAAAAN4/X-RmiGeA7R4/s400/randomhist.png"></a></p>
<p>Above is a histogram of the random strategies' scores. Not so good.
Looks like humans playing the game are better than randomly guessing.</p>
<h4>Best Strategy?</h4>
<p>So lets say you wanted to make the best strategy, what could you look
at? Well, for starters you might be interested in a question like the
following? 'If I put N soldiers in slot X, what percentage of the
existing strategies in the database would I beat in that slot?" The next
graph answers this question.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFsK-VC2qRI/AAAAAAAAAOY/UTtTyvyxhT4/s1600/strategychooserspectral.png"><img alt="image" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFsK-VC2qRI/AAAAAAAAAOY/UTtTyvyxhT4/s400/strategychooserspectral.png"></a></p>
<p>Here I have attempted to show for every X,Y coordinate the following.
With Y soldiers in slot X, what percentage of the existing strategies do
you beat in slot X. I changed the color scaling to make it more refined,
so you can better read it quantitatively.</p>
<h4>Go Forth</h4>
<p>So, there you have it. You are not fueled with what is probably way more
information than you were hoping for. Hopefully these graphs are more
than just pretty, and get you thinking a bit. That is a lot of what
science is about. Make some observations and then attempt to explain the
results with your own models. You can then test your models with
experiment. I've provided you with a bunch of observations and invited
you to construct your own explinations. Now I invite you to perform an
experiment. Think you know whats going on in the game? Then try and beat
it. The link to play is the <a href="http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~aalemi/blotto/index.php">same as
before</a>.</p>

<p>Sorry about the blog hiatus. During the summer, without teaching
classes, inspiration is harder to come by. But, tonight I cooked a
steak. I recently got a new digital meat thermometer. My plan was to
slowly cook the steak until the internal temperature got to be about 140
degrees Fahrenheit with the oven at 200 degrees, take it out, wrap in
tin foil, crank the oven to 500 degrees, stick it back in, and give it a
nice exterior, reaching an internal temperature of about 150 degrees
which would put it at about medium. After I put the steak into the oven
though, I started to watch the temperature go up on my digital
thermometer and thought, why not take data. And so I did. Here are the
results.</p>

<p>Above you see the internal temperature of the steak as a function of
time. First some comments about the graph.</p>
<ul>
<li>The steak started at 37 degrees, the temperature of my refrigerator.</li>
<li>I didn't start taking data until about 20 minutes in.</li>
<li>The red dashed lines mark where I turned up the temperature of the
    oven. It started at 200 degrees, then 250, then 300, and in the
    final stretch, 500 with the broiler.</li>
<li>The green dotted lines mark where I got impatient and opened the
    door to the over to check on the food.</li>
<li>The yellow background denotes where the steak was outside of the
    oven resting in tinfoil.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now some comments on the data</p>
<ul>
<li>You can clearly see a change in the data when I changed the oven
    temperature.</li>
<li>Opening the oven door really seems to slow down the cooking process</li>
<li>The temperature of the center of the steak continues to rise after
    you take it out of the oven.</li>
<li>In fact, curiously enough, the temperature of the center of the
    steak seems to have risen the quickest after it was taken out of the
    oven.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next I decided to look at the heating rate, computed by taking the
finite differences of my data points and propagating the errors.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFi97yIEe9I/AAAAAAAAAMo/EzZ_kvRdb7U/s1600/heatrate.png"><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YOjDhtygcuA/TFi97yIEe9I/AAAAAAAAAMo/EzZ_kvRdb7U/s400/heatrate.png"></a></p>
<p>As you'll see, I really didn't have enough data points or a precise
enough thermometer to really see the changes in the heating rate.
Finally some comments about the food.</p>
<ul>
<li>The steak was good. You'll notice I shot past 150, ended up with a
    temperature of about 160, and a steak that was nearly medium well.</li>
<li>Cooking the steak slowly like this yielded as pretty soft texture,
    akin to a roast. Heck, I essentially roasted the steak.</li>
<li>The steak was served with asparagus and baked potatoes. As an
    interesting aside, the baked potatoes were in the oven along with
    the steak the whole time, but did not cook all the way through. I
    normally bake potatoes at 350 for about an hour, and here they were
    in a hot oven for over an hour and a half, half an hour of which was
    above 300, but they didn't cook through.</li>
</ul>
<p>I clearly have too much time on my hands. I have one more steak, and I
think I'll try a different cooking method. Maybe I'll have the patience
to take data again, we'll see.</p>
